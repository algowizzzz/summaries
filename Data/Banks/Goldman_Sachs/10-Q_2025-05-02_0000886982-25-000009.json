AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nConsolidation The firm consolidates entities\nin which the firm has a controlling financial\ninterest. The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a\nvoting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)\nthe total equity investment at risk is\nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity\nholders have the power to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the\nentity and the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting\ninterest entity is ownership of a majority\nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest\nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable\nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that\nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a\nvoting interest entity. The firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when\nthe firm has a variable interest or interests\nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive\nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for\nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method\nInvestments. When the firm does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity\nbut can exert significant influence over the\nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair\nvalue by electing the fair value option\navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant\ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns\n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstance common stock. In certain cases, the\nfirm applies the equity method of accounting\nto new investments that are strategic in\nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s\nprincipal business activities, when the firm\nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or\nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less\nsignificant. See Note 8 for further\ninformation about equity-method investments.\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed\ninvestment funds with third-party investors.\nThese funds are typically organized as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies\nfor which the firm acts as general partner or\nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a\nmajority of the economic interests in these\nfunds. These funds are usually voting interest\nentities and generally are not consolidated\nbecause third-party investors typically have\nrights to terminate the funds or to remove the\nfirm as general partner or manager.\nInvestments in these funds are generally\nmeasured at net asset value (NAV) and are\nincluded in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and\n22 for further information about investments\nin funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of\nthese consolidated financial statements\nrequires management to make certain estimates\nand assumptions, the most important of which\nrelate to fair value measurements, the\nallowance for credit losses on loans and\nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,\naccounting for goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, provisions for losses that\nmay arise from litigation and regulatory\nproceedings (including governmental\ninvestigations), and accounting for income\ntaxes. These estimates and assumptions are\nbased on the best available information, but\nactual results could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition Financial Assets and\nLiabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and\nliabilities and certain investments are\ncarried at fair value either under the fair\nvalue option or in accordance with other U.S.\nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to\naccount for certain of its loans and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nby electing the fair value option. The fair\nvalue of a financial instrument is the amount\nthat would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked\nto bid prices and financial liabilities are\nmarked to offer prices. Fair value\nmeasurements do not include transaction costs.\nFair value gains or losses are generally\nincluded in market making or other principal\ntransactions. See Note 4 for further\ninformation about fair value measurements.\n                                           \n  7    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with\nclients for services, such as investment\nbanking, investment management, and execution\nand clearing (contracts with clients), when\nthe performance obligations related to the\nunderlying transaction are completed. Revenues\nfrom contracts with clients represent\napproximately 45% of total non-interest\nrevenues for the three months ended March 2025\n(including approximately 80% of investment\nbanking revenues, approximately 95% of\ninvestment management revenues and all\ncommissions and fees), and approximately 40%\nof total non-interest revenues for the three\nmonths ended March 2024 (including\napproximately 85% of investment banking\nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment\nmanagement revenues and all commissions and\nfees). See Note 25 for information about net\nrevenues by business segment. Investment\nBanking Advisory. Fees from financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues when\nthe services related to the underlying\ntransaction are completed under the terms of\nthe assignment. Non-refundable deposits and\nmilestone payments in connection with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nin revenues upon completion of the underlying\ntransaction or when the assignment is\notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nwhen incurred and are included in transaction\nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such\nexpenses are included in investment banking\nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon\ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses\nassociated with underwriting assignments are\ngenerally deferred until the related revenue\nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise\nconcluded. Such expenses are included in\ntransaction based expenses for completed\nassignments. Investment Management The firm\nearns management fees and incentive fees for\ninvestment management services, which are\nincluded in investment management revenues.\nThe firm makes payments to brokers and\nadvisors related to the placement of the\nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),\nwhich are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily NAV and are received monthly. Management\nfees for hedge funds are calculated as a\npercentage of month-end NAV and are generally\nreceived quarterly. Management fees for\nseparately managed accounts are calculated as\na percentage of either the daily or monthly\nNAV and are received quarterly. Management\nfees for private equity funds are calculated\nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are generally received\nquarterly, semi-annually or annually,\ndepending on the fund. Management fees are\nrecognized over time in the period the\nservices are provided. Distribution fees paid\nby the firm are calculated based on either a\npercentage of the management fee, the\ninvestment fund\u2019s NAV or the committed\ncapital. Such fees are included in transaction\nbased expenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees\nare calculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or\nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other\nperformance target. Incentive fees are\ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a\nfund. Fees that are based on performance over\na twelve-month period are subject to\nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment\nperformance over the life of the fund, future\ninvestment underperformance may require fees\npreviously distributed to the firm to be\nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned\nfrom a fund or separately managed account are\nrecognized when it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal of such fees will not\noccur, which is generally when such fees are\nno longer subject to fluctuations in the\nmarket value of investments held by the fund\nor separately managed account. Therefore,\nincentive fees recognized during the period\nmay relate to performance obligations\nsatisfied in previous periods.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    8  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nCommissions and Fees The firm earns\nsubstantially all commissions and fees from\nexecuting and clearing client transactions on\nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter (OTC) transactions.\nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides\nthird-party research services to clients in\nconnection with certain soft-dollar\narrangements. Third-party research costs\nincurred by the firm in connection with such\narrangements are presented net within\ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance\nObligations Remaining performance obligations\nare services that the firm has committed to\nperform in the future in connection with its\ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining\nperformance obligations are generally related\nto its financial advisory assignments and\ncertain investment management activities.\nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory\nassignments cannot be determined until the\noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s\ninvestment management activities, where fees\nare calculated based on the NAV of the fund or\nseparately managed account, future revenues\nassociated with such remaining performance\nobligations cannot be determined as such fees\nare subject to fluctuations in the market\nvalue of investments held by the fund or\nseparately managed account. The firm is able\nto determine the future revenues associated\nwith management fees calculated based on\ncommitted capital. As of March 2025,\nsubstantially all future net revenues\nassociated with such remaining performance\nobligations will be recognized through 2033.\nAnnual revenues associated with such\nperformance obligations average less than $\n300million through 2033. Transfers of\nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has\nrelinquished control over the assets\ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses\nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or\nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement with transferred\nfinancial assets are initially recognized at\nfair value. For transfers of financial assets\nthat are not accounted for as sales, the\nassets are generally included in trading\nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a\ncollateralized financing, with the related\ninterest expense recognized over the life of\nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about transfers of financial\nassets accounted for as collateralized\nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted\nfor as sales. Cash and Cash Equivalents The\nfirm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid\novernight deposits held in the ordinary course\nof business. Cash and cash equivalents\nincluded cash and due from banks of $\n5.33billion as of March 2025 and $ 5.36billion\nas of December 2024. Cash and cash equivalents\nalso included interest-bearing deposits with\nbanks of $ 162.08billion as of March 2025 and\n$ 176.73billion as of December 2024. The firm\nsegregates cash for regulatory and other\npurposes related to client activity. Cash and\ncash equivalents segregated for regulatory and\nother purposes were $ 12.86billion as of March\n2025 and $ 14.84billion as of December 2024.\nIn addition, the firm segregates securities\nfor regulatory and other purposes related to\nclient activity. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about segregated securities.\nCustomer and Other Receivables Customer and\nother receivables included receivables from\ncustomers and counterparties of $\n102.81billion as of March 2025 and $\n92.88billion as of December 2024, and\nreceivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations of $ 62.28billion as of March\n2025 and $ 40.84billion as of December 2024.\nSuch receivables primarily consist of customer\nmargin loans, collateral posted in connection\nwith certain derivative transactions, and\nreceivables resulting from unsettled\ntransactions. Substantially all of these\nreceivables are accounted for at amortized\ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,\nwhich generally approximates fair value. As\nthese receivables are not accounted for at\nfair value, they are not included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5.\nHad these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of\nboth March 2025 and December 2024. See Note 10\nfor further information about customer and\nother receivables accounted for at fair value\nunder the fair value option. Interest on\ncustomer and other receivables is recognized\nover the life of the transaction and included\nin interest income. Customer and other\nreceivables includes receivables from\ncontracts with clients and contract assets.\nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to\nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s\nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n4.19billion as of March 2025 and $ 4.08billion\nas of December 2024. As of both March 2025 and\nDecember 2024, contract assets were not\nmaterial.\n                                           \n  9    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Customer and other\npayables are accounted for at cost plus\naccrued interest, which generally approximates\nfair value. As these payables are not\naccounted for at fair value, they are not\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 and 5. Had these payables been\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,\nsubstantially all would have been classified\nin level 2 as of both March 2025 and December\n2024. Interest on customer and other payables\nis recognized over the life of the transaction\nand included in interest expense. Offsetting\nAssets and Liabilities To reduce credit\nexposures on derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter\ninto master netting agreements or similar\narrangements (collectively, netting\nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such\ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a\ncontract with a counterparty that permits net\nsettlement of multiple transactions with that\ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of\ntermination rights by a non-defaulting party.\nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all\ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is\ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with\nrespect to its derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms\nof the related credit support agreements or\nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit\nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit\nsupport agreement grants the non-defaulting\nparty exercising termination rights the right\nto liquidate the collateral and apply the\nproceeds to any amounts owed. In order to\nassess enforceability of the firm\u2019s right of\nsetoff under netting and credit support\nagreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in\nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the\nagreement. Derivatives are reported on a net-\nby-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for derivative assets and\nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the\nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting\nagreement. Resale agreements and securities\nsold under agreements to repurchase\n(repurchase agreements) and securities\nborrowed and loaned transactions with the same\nsettlement date are presented on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis in the consolidated balance\nsheets when such transactions meet certain\nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements. In the consolidated balance\nsheets, derivatives are reported net of cash\ncollateral received and posted under\nenforceable credit support agreements, when\ntransacted under an enforceable netting\nagreement. In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and\nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not\nreported net of the related cash and\nsecurities received or posted as collateral.\nSee Note 11 for further information about\ncollateral received and pledged, including\nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See\nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about\noffsetting assets and liabilities. Share-Based\nCompensation The cost of employee services\nreceived in exchange for a share-based award\nis generally measured based on the grant-date\nfair value of the award. Share-based awards\nthat do not require future service (i.e.,\nvested awards, including awards granted to\nretirement-eligible employees) are expensed\nimmediately. Share-based awards that require\nfuture service are amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recorded when\nthey occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on\nrestricted stock units (RSUs) are generally\ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that\nrequire future service are forfeited, the\nrelated dividend equivalents originally\ncharged to retained earnings are reclassified\nto compensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues\nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of\nshare-based awards. In limited cases, as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements,\nthe firm may cash settle share-based awards\naccounted for as equity instruments. For these\nawards, additional paid-in capital is adjusted\nto the extent of the difference between the\nvalue of the award at the time of cash\nsettlement and the grant-date value of the\naward. The tax effect related to the\nsettlement of share-based awards and payments\nof dividend equivalents is recorded in income\ntax benefit or expense. Foreign Currency\nTranslation Assets and liabilities denominated\nin non-U.S. currencies are translated at rates\nof exchange prevailing on the date of the\nconsolidated balance sheets and revenues and\nexpenses are translated at average rates of\nexchange for the period. Foreign currency\nremeasurement gains or losses on transactions\nin nonfunctional currencies are recognized in\nearnings. Gains or losses on translation of\nthe financial statements of a non-U.S.\noperation, when the functional currency is\nother than the U.S. dollar, are included, net\nof hedges and taxes, in the consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    10  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value Measurements The fair value\nof a financial instrument is the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid\nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not\ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures\ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active\nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by\nreference to prices for similar instruments,\nquoted prices or recent transactions in less\nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or\nindependently sourced inputs, including, but\nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities,\nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding\nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference\nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower\ncould finance a given financial instrument\nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.\nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for\ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This\nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving\nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based\non the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In\nevaluating the significance of a valuation\ninput, the firm considers, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to\nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as\nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical,\nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.\nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are\nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values\nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial\nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain\nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and\nliabilities may require valuation adjustments\nthat a market participant would require to\narrive at fair value for factors, such as\ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments\nare generally based on market evidence.\nThe table below presents financial assets and\nliabilities carried at fair value.\n                                              \n  $

See Note 5 for further\ninformation about significant unobservable\ninputs used to value level 3 financial\ninstruments. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Trading Cash\nInstruments, Investments and Loans Level 1.\nLevel 1 instruments include U.S. government\nobligations, most non-U.S. government\nobligations, certain agency obligations,\ncertain corporate debt instruments, certain\nmoney market instruments and actively traded\nlisted equities. These instruments are valued\nusing quoted prices for identical unrestricted\ninstruments in active markets. The firm\ndefines active markets for equity instruments\nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market\ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm\ndefines active markets for debt instruments\nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity.\nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain\nnon-U.S. government obligations, most agency\nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and\nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,\nmost state and municipal obligations, most\nmoney market instruments, most other debt\nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed\nequities, certain private equities,\ncommodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be\nverified to quoted prices, recent trading\nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative\npricing sources with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency. Consideration is given to\nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor executable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Valuation\nadjustments are typically made to level 2\ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject\nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair\nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally\nbased on market evidence. Level 3. Level 3\ninstruments have one or more significant\nvaluation inputs that are not observable.\nAbsent evidence to the contrary, level 3\ninstruments are initially valued at\ntransaction price, which is considered to be\nthe best initial estimate of fair value.\nSubsequently, the firm uses other\nmethodologies to determine fair value, which\nvary based on the type of instrument.\nValuation inputs and assumptions are changed\nwhen corroborated by substantive observable\nevidence, including values realized on sales.\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments\nvary by instrument, but are generally based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques. The valuation\ntechniques and the nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair values of\neach type of level 3 instrument are described\nbelow: Loans and Securities Backed by\nCommercial Real Estate Loans and securities\nbacked by commercial real estate are directly\nor indirectly collateralized by a single\nproperty or a portfolio of properties, and may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. Significant inputs are\ngenerally determined based on relative value\nanalyses and include: \u2022 Market yields implied\nby transactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and changes in market\nindices, such as the CMBX (an index that\ntracks the performance of commercial mortgage\nbonds); \u2022 Transaction prices in both the\nunderlying collateral and instruments with the\nsame or similar underlying collateral; \u2022 A\nmeasure of expected future cash flows in a\ndefault scenario (recovery rates) implied by\nthe value of the underlying collateral, which\nis mainly driven by current performance of the\nunderlying collateral and capitalization\nrates. Recovery rates are expressed as a\npercentage of notional or face value of the\ninstrument and reflect the benefit of credit\nenhancements on certain instruments; and \u2022\nTiming of expected future cash flows\n(duration) which, in certain cases, may\nincorporate the impact of any loan\nforbearances and other unobservable inputs\n(e.g., prepayment speeds). Loans and\nSecurities Backed by Residential Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by residential\nreal estate are directly or indirectly\ncollateralized by portfolios of residential\nreal estate and may include tranches of\nvarying levels of subordination. Significant\ninputs are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons to instruments with similar\ncollateral and risk profiles. Significant\ninputs include: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets; \u2022\nTransaction prices in both the underlying\ncollateral and instruments with the same or\nsimilar underlying collateral; and \u2022 Duration,\ndriven by underlying loan prepayment speeds\nand residential property liquidation\ntimelines.\n                                            \n  13    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nCorporate Debt Instruments Corporate debt\ninstruments includes corporate loans, debt\nsecurities and convertible debentures.\nSignificant inputs for corporate debt\ninstruments are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons both to prices of credit default\nswaps that reference the same or similar\nunderlying instrument or entity and to other\ndebt instruments for the same or similar\nissuer for which observable prices or broker\nquotations are available. Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks\nthe performance of corporate credit); \u2022\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions\nand, where the firm uses credit default swaps\nto value the related instrument, the cost of\nborrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n\u2022 Duration; and \u2022 Market and transaction\nmultiples for corporate debt instruments with\nconvertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities Equity securities consists\nof private equities. Recent third-party\ncompleted or pending transactions (e.g.,\nmerger proposals, debt restructurings, tender\noffers) are considered the best evidence for\nany change in fair value. When these are not\navailable, the following valuation\nmethodologies are used, as appropriate: \u2022\nIndustry multiples (primarily EBITDA and\nrevenue multiples) and public comparables; \u2022\nTransactions in similar instruments; \u2022\nDiscounted cash flow techniques; and \u2022 Third-\nparty appraisals. The firm also considers\nchanges in the outlook for the relevant\nindustry and financial performance of the\nissuer as compared to projected performance.\nSignificant inputs include: \u2022 Market and\ntransaction multiples; \u2022 Discount rates and\ncapitalization rates; and \u2022 For equity\nsecurities with debt-like features, market\nyields implied by transactions of similar or\nrelated assets, current performance and\nrecovery assumptions, and duration. Other\nTrading Cash Instruments, Investments and\nLoans The significant inputs to the valuation\nof other trading cash instruments, investments\nand loans are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons both to prices of credit default\nswaps that reference the same or similar\nunderlying instrument or entity and to other\ndebt instruments for the same issuer for which\nobservable prices or broker quotations are\navailable. Significant inputs include: \u2022\nMarket yields implied by transactions of\nsimilar or related assets and/or current\nlevels and trends of market indices; \u2022 Current\nperformance and recovery assumptions and,\nwhere the firm uses credit default swaps to\nvalue the related instrument, the cost of\nborrowing the underlying reference obligation;\nand \u2022 Duration. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Derivatives The firm\u2019s\nlevel 2 and level 3 derivatives are valued\nusing derivative pricing models (e.g.,\ndiscounted cash flow models, correlation\nmodels and models that incorporate option\npricing methodologies, such as Monte Carlo\nsimulations). Price transparency of\nderivatives can generally be characterized by\nproduct type, as described below. \u2022 Interest\nRate. In general, the key inputs used to value\ninterest rate derivatives are transparent,\neven for most long-dated contracts. Interest\nrate swaps and options denominated in the\ncurrencies of leading industrialized nations\nare characterized by high trading volumes and\ntight bid/offer spreads. Interest rate\nderivatives that reference indices, such as an\ninflation index, or the shape of the yield\ncurve (e.g., 10-year swap rate vs. 2-year swap\nrate) are more complex, but the key inputs are\ngenerally observable. \u2022 Credit. Price\ntransparency for credit default swaps,\nincluding both single names and baskets of\ncredits, varies by market and underlying\nreference entity or obligation. Credit default\nswaps that reference indices, large corporates\nand major sovereigns generally exhibit the\nmost price transparency. For credit default\nswaps with other underliers, price\ntransparency varies based on credit rating,\nthe cost of borrowing the underlying reference\nobligations, and the availability of the\nunderlying reference obligations for delivery\nupon the default of the issuer. Credit default\nswaps that reference loans, asset-backed\nsecurities and emerging market debt\ninstruments tend to have less price\ntransparency than those that reference\ncorporate bonds. In addition, more complex\ncredit derivatives, such as those sensitive to\nthe correlation between two or more underlying\nreference obligations, generally have less\nprice transparency.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    14  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\n\u2022 Currency. Prices for currency derivatives\nbased on the exchange rates of leading\nindustrialized nations, including those with\nlonger tenors, are generally transparent. The\nprimary difference between the price\ntransparency of developed and emerging market\ncurrency derivatives is that emerging markets\ntend to be only observable for contracts with\nshorter tenors. \u2022 Commodity. Commodity\nderivatives include transactions referenced to\nenergy (e.g., oil, natural gas and\nelectricity), metals (e.g., precious and base)\nand soft commodities (e.g., agricultural).\nPrice transparency varies based on the\nunderlying commodity, delivery location, tenor\nand product quality (e.g., diesel fuel\ncompared to unleaded gasoline). In general,\nprice transparency for commodity derivatives\nis greater for contracts with shorter tenors\nand contracts that are more closely aligned\nwith major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n\u2022 Equity. Price transparency for equity\nderivatives varies by market and underlier.\nOptions on indices and the common stock of\ncorporates included in major equity indices\nexhibit the most price transparency. Equity\nderivatives generally have observable market\nprices, except for contracts with long tenors\nor reference prices that differ significantly\nfrom current market prices. More complex\nequity derivatives, such as those sensitive to\nthe correlation between two or more individual\nstocks, generally have less price\ntransparency. Liquidity is essential to the\nobservability of all product types. If\ntransaction volumes decline, previously\ntransparent prices and other inputs may become\nunobservable. Conversely, even highly\nstructured products may at times have trading\nvolumes large enough to provide observability\nof prices and other inputs. Level 1. Level 1\nderivatives include short-term contracts for\nfuture delivery of securities when the\nunderlying security is a level 1 instrument,\nand exchange-traded derivatives if they are\nactively traded and are valued at their quoted\nmarket price. Level 2. Level 2 derivatives\ninclude OTC derivatives for which all\nsignificant valuation inputs are corroborated\nby market evidence and exchange-traded\nderivatives that are not actively traded\nand/or that are valued using models that\ncalibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC\nderivatives. The selection of a particular\nmodel to value a derivative depends on the\ncontractual terms of and specific risks\ninherent in the instrument, as well as the\navailability of pricing information in the\nmarket. For derivatives that trade in liquid\nmarkets, model selection does not involve\nsignificant management judgment because\noutputs of models can be calibrated to market-\nclearing levels. Valuation models require a\nvariety of inputs, such as contractual terms,\nmarket prices, yield curves, discount rates\n(including those derived from interest rates\non collateral received and posted as specified\nin credit support agreements for\ncollateralized derivatives), credit curves,\nmeasures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss\nseverity rates and correlations of such\ninputs. Significant inputs to the valuations\nof level 2 derivatives can be verified to\nmarket transactions, broker or dealer\nquotations or other alternative pricing\nsources with reasonable levels of price\ntransparency. Consideration is given to the\nnature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or\nexecutable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Level 3 . Level 3\nderivatives are valued using models which\nutilize observable level 1 and/or level 2\ninputs, as well as unobservable level 3\ninputs. The significant unobservable inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s level 3 derivatives\nare described below. \u2022 For level 3 interest\nrate and currency derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include correlations of\ncertain currencies and interest rates (e.g.,\nthe correlation between Euro inflation and\nEuro interest rates) and specific interest\nrate and currency volatilities. \u2022 For level 3\ncredit derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs include illiquid credit spreads and\nupfront credit points, which are unique to\nspecific reference obligations and reference\nentities, and recovery rates. \u2022 For level 3\ncommodity derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include volatilities for\noptions with strike prices that differ\nsignificantly from current market prices and\nprices or spreads for certain products for\nwhich the product quality or physical location\nof the commodity is not aligned with benchmark\nindices. \u2022 For level 3 equity derivatives,\nsignificant unobservable inputs generally\ninclude equity volatility inputs for options\nthat are long-dated and/or have strike prices\nthat differ significantly from current market\nprices. In addition, the valuation of certain\nstructured trades requires the use of level 3\ncorrelation inputs, such as the correlation of\nthe price performance of two or more\nindividual stocks or the correlation of the\nprice performance for a basket of stocks to\nanother asset class, such as commodities.\n                                            \n  15    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Level 3 inputs are\nchanged when corroborated by evidence, such as\nsimilar market transactions, third-party\npricing services and/or broker or dealer\nquotations or other empirical market data. In\ncircumstances where the firm cannot verify the\nmodel value by reference to market\ntransactions, it is possible that a different\nvaluation model could produce a materially\ndifferent estimate of fair value. See Note 5\nfor further information about significant\nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of\nlevel 3 derivatives. Valuation Adjustments.\nValuation adjustments are integral to\ndetermining the fair value of derivative\nportfolios and are used to adjust the mid-\nmarket valuations produced by derivative\npricing models to the exit price valuation.\nThese adjustments incorporate bid/offer\nspreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and\nfunding valuation adjustments, which account\nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in\nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative\nportfolios. The firm also makes funding\nvaluation adjustments to collateralized\nderivatives where the terms of the agreement\ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge\ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are\ngenerally used when calibrating valuation\nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In\naddition, for derivatives that include\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm\nmakes model or exit price adjustments to\naccount for the valuation uncertainty present\nin the transaction. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Other Financial Assets\nand Liabilities at Fair Value In addition to\ntrading cash instruments, derivatives, and\ncertain investments and loans, the firm\naccounts for certain of its other financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value under the\nfair value option. Such instruments include\nrepurchase agreements and substantially all\nresale agreements; certain securities borrowed\nand loaned transactions; certain customer and\nother receivables, including certain margin\nloans; certain time deposits, including\nstructured certificates of deposit, which are\nhybrid financial instruments; substantially\nall other secured financings, including\nstructured financing arrangements and\ntransfers of assets accounted for as\nfinancings; certain unsecured short- and long-\nterm borrowings, substantially all of which\nare hybrid financial instruments; and certain\nother assets and liabilities. These\ninstruments are generally valued based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques, which\nincorporate inputs with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency, and are generally\nclassified in level 2 because the inputs are\nobservable. Valuation adjustments may be made\nfor liquidity and for counterparty and the\nfirm\u2019s credit quality. The significant inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s other financial\nassets and liabilities are described below.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements and\nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of resale\nand repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and interest rates. Customer and Other\nReceivables. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of receivables are interest rates,\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and funding spreads. Deposits. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of time\ndeposits are interest rates and the amount and\ntiming of future cash flows. The inputs used\nto value the embedded derivative component of\nhybrid financial instruments are consistent\nwith the inputs used to value the firm\u2019s other\nderivative instruments described above. See\nNote 7 for further information about\nderivatives and Note 13 for further\ninformation about deposits. Other Secured\nFinancings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other secured financings are the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, funding spreads and the\nfair value of the collateral delivered by the\nfirm (determined using the amount and timing\nof expected future cash flows, market prices,\nmarket yields and recovery assumptions). See\nNote 11 for further information about other\nsecured financings. Unsecured Short- and Long-\nTerm Borrowings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of unsecured short- and long-term\nborrowings are the amount and timing of\nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,\nthe credit spreads of the firm and commodity\nprices for prepaid commodity transactions. The\ninputs used to value the embedded derivative\ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are\nconsistent with the inputs used to value the\nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described\nabove. See Note 7 for further information\nabout derivatives and Note 14 for further\ninformation about borrowings. Other Assets and\nLiabilities. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other assets and liabilities are\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, market yields,\nvolatility and correlation inputs. The inputs\nused to value the embedded derivative\ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are\nconsistent with the inputs used to value the\nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described\nabove.

An average\ngreater than the median indicates that the\nmajority of inputs are below the average. For\nexample, the difference between the average\nand the median for credit spreads indicates\nthat the majority of the inputs fall in the\nlower end of the range. \u2022 The ranges, averages\nand medians of these inputs are not\nrepresentative of the appropriate inputs to\nuse when calculating the fair value of any one\nderivative. For example, the highest\ncorrelation for interest rate derivatives is\nappropriate for valuing a specific interest\nrate derivative but may not be appropriate for\nvaluing any other interest rate derivative.\nAccordingly, the ranges of inputs do not\nrepresent uncertainty in, or possible ranges\nof, fair value measurements of level 3\nderivatives. \u2022 Interest rates, currencies and\nequities derivatives are valued using option\npricing models, credit derivatives are valued\nusing option pricing, correlation and\ndiscounted cash flow models, and commodities\nderivatives are valued using option pricing\nand discounted cash flow models. \u2022 The fair\nvalue of any one instrument may be determined\nusing multiple valuation techniques. For\nexample, option pricing models and discounted\ncash flow models are typically used together\nto determine fair value. Therefore, the level\n3 balance encompasses both of these\ntechniques. \u2022 Correlation within currencies\nand equities includes cross-product type\ncorrelation. \u2022 Natural gas spread represents\nthe spread per million British thermal units\nof natural gas. \u2022 Oil spread represents the\nspread per barrel of oil and refined products.\n\u2022 Electricity price represents the price per\nmegawatt hour of electricity. Range of\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs. The following\nprovides information about the ranges of\nsignificant unobservable inputs used to value\nthe firm\u2019s level 3 derivative instruments: \u2022\nCorrelation. Ranges for correlation cover a\nvariety of underliers both within one product\ntype (e.g., equity index and equity single\nstock names) and across product types (e.g.,\ncorrelation of an interest rate and a\ncurrency), as well as across regions.\nGenerally, cross-product type correlation\ninputs are used to value more complex\ninstruments and are lower than correlation\ninputs on assets within the same derivative\nproduct type. \u2022 Volatility. Ranges for\nvolatility cover numerous underliers across a\nvariety of markets, maturities and strike\nprices. For example, volatility of equity\nindices is generally lower than volatility of\nsingle stocks. \u2022 Credit spreads, upfront\ncredit points and recovery rates. The ranges\nfor credit spreads, upfront credit points and\nrecovery rates cover a variety of underliers\n(index and single names), regions, sectors,\nmaturities and credit qualities (high-yield\nand investment-grade). The broad range of this\npopulation gives rise to the width of the\nranges of significant unobservable inputs. \u2022\nCommodity prices and spreads. The ranges for\ncommodity prices and spreads cover variability\nin products, maturities and delivery\nlocations. Sensitivity of Fair Value\nMeasurement to Changes in Significant\nUnobservable Inputs. The following is a\ndescription of the directional sensitivity of\nthe firm\u2019s level 3 fair value measurements to\nchanges in significant unobservable inputs, in\nisolation, as of each period-end: \u2022\nCorrelation. In general, for contracts where\nthe holder benefits from the convergence of\nthe underlying asset or index prices (e.g.,\ninterest rates, credit spreads, foreign\nexchange rates, inflation rates and equity\nprices), an increase in correlation results in\na higher fair value measurement. \u2022 Volatility.\nIn general, for purchased options, an increase\nin volatility results in a higher fair value\nmeasurement. \u2022 Credit spreads, upfront credit\npoints and recovery rates. In general, the\nfair value of purchased credit protection\nincreases as credit spreads or upfront credit\npoints increase or recovery rates decrease.\nCredit spreads, upfront credit points and\nrecovery rates are strongly related to\ndistinctive risk factors of the underlying\nreference obligations, which include reference\nentity-specific factors, such as leverage,\nvolatility and industry, market-based risk\nfactors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity\nof the underlying reference obligation, and\nmacroeconomic conditions. \u2022 Commodity prices\nand spreads.

For example, the\nhighest yield for corporate loans is\nappropriate for valuing a specific corporate\nloan but may not be appropriate for valuing\nany other corporate loan. Accordingly, the\nranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty\nin, or possible ranges of, fair value\nmeasurements of level 3 loans. \u2022 Increases in\nyield or duration used in the valuation of\nlevel 3 loans would have resulted in a lower\nfair value measurement, while increases in\nrecovery rate would have resulted in a higher\nfair value measurement as of both March 2025\nand December 2024.

Accordingly, gains or losses in\none product type frequently offset gains or\nlosses in other product types. For example,\nmost of the firm\u2019s longer-term derivatives\nacross product types are sensitive to changes\nin interest rates and may be economically\nhedged with interest rate swaps. Similarly, a\nsignificant portion of the firm\u2019s trading cash\ninstruments and derivatives across product\ntypes has exposure to foreign currencies and\nmay be economically hedged with foreign\ncurrency contracts.\n                                            \n  31    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Certain of the\nfirm\u2019s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled\nthrough central clearing counterparties (OTC-\ncleared), while others are bilateral contracts\nbetween two counterparties (bilateral OTC).\nMarket Making. As a market maker, the firm\nenters into derivative transactions to provide\nliquidity to clients and to facilitate the\ntransfer and hedging of their risks. In this\nrole, the firm typically acts as principal and\nis required to commit capital to provide\nexecution, and maintains market-making\npositions in response to, or in anticipation\nof, client demand. Risk Management. The firm\nalso enters into derivatives to actively\nmanage risk exposures that arise from its\nmarket-making and investing and financing\nactivities. The firm\u2019s holdings and exposures\nare hedged, in many cases, on either a\nportfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed\nto an instrument-by-instrument basis. The\noffsetting impact of this economic hedging is\nreflected in the same business segment as the\nrelated revenues. In addition, the firm may\nenter into derivatives designated as hedges\nunder U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to\nmanage interest rate exposure of certain\nfixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits\nand certain U.S. and non-U.S. government\nsecurities classified as available-for-sale,\nforeign exchange risk of certain available-\nfor-sale securities, the net investment in\ncertain non-U.S. operations, the exposure to\nthe variability of the forecasted cash flows\nassociated with certain floating-rate assets\nand the price risk of certain commodities.\n\nThe firm enters into various types of\nderivatives, including: \u2022 Futures and\nForwards.

See Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s fair value measurement\npolicies, valuation techniques and significant\ninputs used to determine the fair value of\nderivatives, and Note 5 for further\ninformation about derivatives within the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Credit Derivatives The firm\nenters into a broad array of credit\nderivatives to facilitate client transactions\nand to manage the credit risk associated with\nmarket-making and investing and financing\nactivities. Credit derivatives are actively\nmanaged based on the firm\u2019s net risk position.\nCredit derivatives are generally individually\nnegotiated contracts and can have various\nsettlement and payment conventions. Credit\nevents include failure to pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of indebtedness, restructuring,\nrepudiation and dissolution of the reference\nentity. The firm enters into the following\ntypes of credit derivatives: \u2022 Credit Default\nSwaps. Single-name credit default swaps\nprotect the buyer against the loss of\nprincipal on one or more bonds, loans or\nmortgages (reference obligations) in the event\nthe issuer of the reference obligations\nsuffers a credit event. The buyer of\nprotection pays an initial or periodic premium\nto the seller and receives protection for the\nperiod of the contract. If there is no credit\nevent, as defined in the contract, the seller\nof protection makes no payments to the buyer.\nIf a credit event occurs, the seller of\nprotection is required to make a payment to\nthe buyer, calculated according to the terms\nof the contract. \u2022 Credit Options. In a credit\noption, the option writer assumes the\nobligation to purchase or sell a reference\nobligation at a specified price or credit\nspread. The option purchaser buys the right,\nbut does not assume the obligation, to sell\nthe reference obligation to, or purchase it\nfrom, the option writer. The payments on\ncredit options depend either on a particular\ncredit spread or the price of the reference\nobligation.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    34  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\n\u2022 Credit Indices, Baskets and Tranches. Credit\nderivatives may reference a basket of single-\nname credit default swaps or a broad-based\nindex. If a credit event occurs in one of the\nunderlying reference obligations, the\nprotection seller pays the protection buyer.\nThe payment is typically a pro-rata portion of\nthe transaction\u2019s total notional amount based\non the underlying defaulted reference\nobligation. In certain transactions, the\ncredit risk of a basket or index is separated\ninto various portions (tranches), each having\ndifferent levels of subordination. The most\njunior tranches cover initial defaults and\nonce losses exceed the notional amount of\nthese junior tranches, any excess loss is\ncovered by the next most senior tranche. \u2022\nTotal Return Swaps. A total return swap\ntransfers the risks relating to economic\nperformance of a reference obligation from the\nprotection buyer to the protection seller.\nTypically, the protection buyer receives a\nfloating rate of interest and protection\nagainst any reduction in fair value of the\nreference obligation, and the protection\nseller receives the cash flows associated with\nthe reference obligation, plus any increase in\nthe fair value of the reference obligation.\nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to\nwritten credit derivatives primarily by\nentering into offsetting purchased credit\nderivatives with identical underliers.\nSubstantially all of the firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative transactions are with\nfinancial institutions and are subject to\nstringent collateral thresholds. In addition,\nupon the occurrence of a specified trigger\nevent, the firm may take possession of the\nreference obligations underlying a particular\nwritten credit derivative, and consequently\nmay, upon liquidation of the reference\nobligations, recover amounts on the underlying\nreference obligations in the event of default.\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout credit\nderivatives.\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026  0        \u2026              \u2026         \n         \u2026  -        -              \u2026         \n         \u2026  \u2026        \u2026              \u2026         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 Fair values exclude\nthe effects of both\nnetting of receivable\nbalances with payable\nbalances under\nenforceable netting\nagreements, and\nnetting of cash\nreceived or posted\nunder enforceable\ncredit support\nagreements, and\ntherefore are not\nrepresentative of the\nfirm\u2019s credit\nexposure.\n\u2022 Tenor is based on\nthe remaining\ncontractual maturity\nfor substantially all\nwritten credit\nderivatives.\n\u2022 The credit spread on\nthe underlier,\ntogether with the\ntenor of the contract,\nare indicators of\npayment/performance\nrisk.

The weighted average yield is\npresented on a pre-tax basis and computed\nusing the effective interest rate of each\nsecurity at the end of the period, weighted\nbased on the fair value of each security. The\neffective interest rate considers the\ncontractual coupon, the amortization of\npremiums and accretion of discounts, and\nexcludes the effect of related hedges. \u2022\nSubstantially all available-for-sale\nsecurities were classified in level 1 of the\nfair value hierarchy. \u2022 If the fair value of\navailable-for-sale securities is less than\namortized cost, such securities are considered\nimpaired. If the firm has the intent to sell\nthe debt security, or if it is more likely\nthan not that the firm will be required to\nsell the debt security before recovery of its\namortized cost, the difference between the\namortized cost (net of allowance, if any) and\nthe fair value of the securities is recognized\nas an impairment loss in earnings. The firm\ndid not record any such impairment losses\nduring either the three months ended March\n2025 or March 2024.

Credit Quality Risk\nAssessment. The firm\u2019s risk assessment process\nincludes evaluating the credit quality of its\nloans by Risk. For corporate loans and a\nmajority of securities-based, real estate,\nother collateralized and other loans, the firm\nperforms credit analyses which incorporate\ninitial and ongoing evaluations of the\ncapacity and willingness of a borrower to meet\nits financial obligations. These credit\nevaluations are performed on an annual basis\nor more frequently if deemed necessary as a\nresult of events or changes in circumstances.\nThe firm determines an internal credit rating\nfor the borrower by considering the results of\nthe credit evaluations and assumptions with\nrespect to the nature of and outlook for the\nborrower\u2019s industry and the economic\nenvironment. For collateralized loans, the\nfirm also takes into consideration collateral\nreceived or other credit support arrangements\nwhen determining an internal credit rating.\nFor credit card loans and for loans that are\nnot assigned an internal credit rating,\nincluding U.S. residential mortgage loans\nextended to wealth management clients, the\nfirm reviews certain key metrics, including,\nbut not limited to, the Fair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) credit scores, loan to value ratios,\ndelinquency status, collateral value and other\nrisk factors.\n                                            \n  43    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

To\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, the firm\nclassifies its loans\nand lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at amortized cost\ninto wholesale and\nconsumer portfolios.\nThese portfolios\nrepresent the level at\nwhich the firm has\ndeveloped and\ndocumented its\nmethodology to\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. The allowance\nfor credit losses is\nmeasured on a\ncollective basis for\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics using\na modeled approach and\non an asset-specific\nbasis for loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses takes\ninto account the\nweighted average of a\nrange of forecasts of\nfuture economic\nconditions over the\nexpected life of the\nloans and lending\ncommitments. The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude multiple\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-\nyearperiod. For loans\nwith expected lives\nbeyond three years,\nthe model reverts to\nhistorical loss\ninformation based on a\nnon-linear modeled\napproach. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios described\nbelow. The firm\napplies judgment in\nweighing individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including the\nfirm\u2019s internally\nderived economic\noutlook, market\nconsensus, recent\nmacroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends.

The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for wholesale\nloans and lending\ncommitments that\nexhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics is\nmeasured using a\nmodeled approach.\nThese models determine\nthe probability of\ndefault and loss given\ndefault based on\nvarious risk factors,\nincluding internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators, the\nborrower\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial\nobligations, the\nborrower\u2019s country of\nrisk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. For\nlending commitments,\nthe methodology also\nconsiders the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding.\nIn addition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nthe loan-to-value\nratio, debt service\nratio and home price\nindex. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nwholesale loans and\nlending commitments\ninclude unemployment\nrates, GDP, credit\nspreads, commercial\nand industrial\ndelinquency rates,\nshort- and long-term\ninterest rates, and\noil prices. The\nallowance for loan\nlosses for wholesale\nloans that do not\nshare similar risk\ncharacteristics, such\nas nonaccrual loans,\nis calculated using\nthe present value of\nexpected future cash\nflows discounted at\nthe loan\u2019s effective\nrate, the observable\nmarket price of the\nloan, or, in the case\nof collateral\ndependent loans, the\nfair value of the\ncollateral less\nestimated costs to\nsell, if applicable.\nWholesale loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\nConsumer. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for consumer\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics is\ncalculated using a\nmodeled approach which\nclassifies consumer\nloans into pools based\non borrower-related\nand exposure-related\ncharacteristics that\ndifferentiate a pool\u2019s\nrisk characteristics\nfrom other pools. The\nfactors considered in\ndetermining a pool are\ngenerally consistent\nwith the risk\ncharacteristics used\nfor internal credit\nrisk measurement and\nmanagement and include\nkey metrics, such as\nFICO credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nconsumer loans include\nunemployment rates and\ndelinquency rates. The\nexpected life of\nrevolving credit card\nloans is determined by\nmodeling expected\nfuture draws and the\ntiming and amount of\nrepayments allocated\nto the funded balance.\nThe firm does not\nrecognize an allowance\nfor credit losses on\ncredit card lending\ncommitments as they\nare cancellable by the\nfirm. Credit card\nloans are charged off\nwhen they are 180 days\npast due.\n\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses Rollforward\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout the allowance\nfor credit losses.\n

As of March\n2025, this multi-\nscenario forecast was\nweighted towards the\nbaseline and adverse\neconomic scenarios.\nThe table below\npresents the\nforecasted U.S.\nunemployment and U.S.\nGDP growth rates used\nin the baseline\neconomic scenario of\nthe forecast model.\n                                              \n  U.S. unemployment                           \n  rate                                        \n  Forecast for the                            \n  quarter ended:            As of March 2025  \n  June 2025            4.3  %                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  December 2025        4.4  %                 \n  June 2026            4.3  %                 \n  U.S. GDP rate                               \n  Forecast for the                            \n  year:                                       \n  2025                 1.9  %                 \n  2026                 1.8  %                 \n  2027                 1.8  %                 \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 U.S. unemployment\nrate represents the\nrate forecasted as of\nthe respective\nquarter-end.\n\u2022 U.S. GDP rate\nrepresents the year-\nover-year growth rate\nforecasted for the\nrespective years.\nThe adverse economic\nscenario of the\nforecast model\nreflects a global\nrecession, resulting\nin an economic\ncontraction and rising\nunemployment rates. In\nthis scenario, the\nU.S. unemployment rate\npeaks at 7.4% (during\nthe second quarter of\n2026) and the maximum\ndecline in quarterly\nU.S. GDP relative to\nthe first quarter of\n2025 is 2.7% (which\noccurs during the\nfirst quarter of\n2026).\nIn the multi-scenario\nforecast, the weighted\naverage peak U.S.\nunemployment rate is\n5.5% (during the\nsecond quarter of\n2026) and the largest\ndifference in\nquarterly U.S. GDP\nbetween the baseline\nscenario and the\nweighted average is (\n2.2)% (which occurs\nduring the second\nquarter of 2027).\nWhile the U.S.\nunemployment and U.S.\nGDP growth rates are\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model,\nthe model contemplates\na variety of other\ninputs across a range\nof scenarios to\nprovide a forecast of\nfuture economic\nconditions. Given the\ncomplex nature of the\nforecasting process,\nno single economic\nvariable can be viewed\nin isolation and\nindependently of other\ninputs.\n\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses Commentary\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 2025. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses decreased by $\n125million during the\nthree months ended\nMarch 2025, primarily\nreflecting a reserve\nrelease relating to\ncredit card loans due\nto lower balances\nresulting from\nseasonal repayments.\nCharge-offs for the\nthree months ended\nMarch 2025 for\nwholesale loans were\nnot material. Three\nMonths Ended March\n2024. The allowance\nfor credit losses\ndecreased by $\n135million during the\nthree months ended\nMarch 2024, primarily\nreflecting a reserve\nreduction in the\nconsumer portfolio.\nCharge-offs for the\nthree months ended\nMarch 2024 for\nwholesale loans were\nnot material and\ncharge-offs for\nconsumer loans were\nprimarily related to\ncredit cards.\nEstimated Fair Value\nThe table below\npresents the estimated\nfair value of loans\nthat are not accounted\nfor at fair value and\nin what level of the\nfair value hierarchy\nthey would have been\nclassified if they had\nbeen included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value\nhierarchy.\n                                              \n                       \u2026                      \n            \u2026    \u2026     \u2026  \u2026                   \n            \u2026    2     \u2026  3         \u2026         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026          $  \u2026     $  9\u2026     $  2\u2026  \n      $  \u2026          $  \u2026     $  1\u2026     $  4\u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026          $  \u2026     $  8\u2026     $  1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026          $  \u2026     $  6\u2026     $  3\u2026  \n                                              \nSee Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s\nfair value measurement\npolicies, valuation\ntechniques and\nsignificant inputs\nused to determine the\nfair value of loans,\nand Note 5 for\ninformation about\nloans within the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    50  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value\nOption Other Financial\nAssets and Liabilities\nat Fair Value In\naddition to trading\nassets and\nliabilities, and\ncertain investments\nand loans, the firm\naccounts for certain\nof its other financial\nassets and liabilities\nat fair value,\nsubstantially all\nunder the fair value\noption. The primary\nreasons for electing\nthe fair value option\nare to: \u2022 Reflect\neconomic events in\nearnings on a timely\nbasis; \u2022 Mitigate\nvolatility in earnings\nfrom using different\nmeasurement attributes\n(e.g., transfers of\nfinancial assets\naccounted for as\nfinancings are\nrecorded at fair\nvalue, whereas the\nrelated secured\nfinancing would be\nrecorded on an accrual\nbasis absent electing\nthe fair value\noption); and \u2022 Address\nsimplification and\ncost-benefit\nconsiderations (e.g.,\naccounting for hybrid\nfinancial instruments\nat fair value in their\nentirety versus\nbifurcation of\nembedded derivatives\nand hedge accounting\nfor debt hosts).\nHybrid financial\ninstruments are\ninstruments that\ncontain bifurcatable\nembedded derivatives\nand do not require\nsettlement by physical\ndelivery of\nnonfinancial assets\n(e.g., physical\ncommodities). Unless\nthe firm has elected\nto account for the\nentire hybrid\nfinancial instrument\nat fair value under\nthe fair value option,\nthe embedded\nderivative is\nbifurcated from the\nassociated host\ncontract, the\nderivative is\naccounted for at fair\nvalue and the host\ncontract is accounted\nfor at amortized cost,\nadjusted for the\neffective portion of\nany fair value hedges.\nOther financial assets\nand liabilities\naccounted for at fair\nvalue under the fair\nvalue option include:\n\u2022 Repurchase\nagreements and\nsubstantially all\nresale agreements; \u2022\nCertain securities\nborrowed and loaned\ntransactions; \u2022\nCertain customer and\nother receivables and\ncertain other assets\nand liabilities; \u2022\nCertain time deposits\n(deposits with no\nstated maturity are\nnot eligible for a\nfair value option\nelection), including\nstructured\ncertificates of\ndeposit, which are\nhybrid financial\ninstruments; \u2022\nSubstantially all\nother secured\nfinancings, including\nstructured financing\narrangements and\ntransfers of assets\naccounted for as\nfinancings; and \u2022\nCertain unsecured\nshort- and long-term\nborrowings,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich are hybrid\nfinancial instruments.\n\nSee Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s\nfair value measurement\npolicies, valuation\ntechniques and\nsignificant inputs\nused to determine the\nfair value of other\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities, and Note\n5 for information\nabout other financial\nassets and liabilities\nwithin the fair value\nhierarchy.

See\nNote 18 for further\ninformation about\nlending commitments.\n\nImpact of Credit\nSpreads on Loans and\nLending Commitments\nThe estimated net loss\nattributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads on loans and\nlending commitments\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected was not\nmaterial for both the\nthree months ended\nMarch 2025 and March\n2024. The firm\ngenerally calculates\nthe fair value of\nloans and lending\ncommitments for which\nthe fair value option\nis elected by\ndiscounting future\ncash flows at a rate\nwhich incorporates the\ninstrument-specific\ncredit spreads. For\nfloating-rate loans\nand lending\ncommitments,\nsubstantially all\nchanges in fair value\nare attributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads, whereas for\nfixed-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nchanges in fair value\nare also attributable\nto changes in interest\nrates.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    52  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things,\nfacilitate client activities, invest excess\ncash, acquire securities to cover short\npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings with\nthe same settlement date are presented on a\nnet-by-counterparty basis when such\ntransactions meet certain settlement criteria\nand are subject to netting agreements.\nInterest on collateralized agreements, which\nis included in interest income, and\ncollateralized financings, which is included\nin interest expense, is recognized over the\nlife of the transaction. See Note 23 for\nfurther information about interest income and\ninterest expense. Resale and Repurchase\nAgreements A resale agreement is a transaction\nin which the firm purchases financial\ninstruments from a seller, typically in\nexchange for cash, and simultaneously enters\ninto an agreement to resell the same or\nsubstantially the same financial instruments\nto the seller at a stated price plus accrued\ninterest at a future date. A repurchase\nagreement is a transaction in which the firm\nsells financial instruments to a buyer,\ntypically in exchange for cash, and\nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same\nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a\nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale\nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d) involve the legal transfer of\nownership of financial instruments, they are\naccounted for as financing arrangements\nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the\nmaturity of the agreement. The financial\ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and\nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations, and\ninvestment-grade sovereign obligations. The\nfirm receives financial instruments purchased\nunder resale agreements and makes delivery of\nfinancial instruments sold under repurchase\nagreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the\nfirm monitors the market value of these\nfinancial instruments on a daily basis, and\ndelivers or obtains additional collateral due\nto changes in the market value of the\nfinancial instruments, as appropriate. For\nresale agreements, the firm typically requires\ncollateral with a fair value approximately\nequal to the carrying value of the relevant\nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRepurchase agreements and substantially all\nresale agreements are recorded at fair value\nunder the fair value option. See Note 5 for\nfurther information about repurchase and\nresale agreements. Securities Borrowed and\nLoaned Transactions In a securities borrowed\ntransaction, the firm borrows securities from\na counterparty in exchange for cash or\nsecurities. When the firm returns the\nsecurities, the counterparty returns the cash\nor securities. Interest is generally paid\nperiodically over the life of the transaction.\nIn a securities loaned transaction, the firm\nlends securities to a counterparty in exchange\nfor cash or securities. When the counterparty\nreturns the securities, the firm returns the\ncash or securities posted as collateral.\nInterest is generally paid periodically over\nthe life of the transaction. In a transaction\nwhere the firm lends securities and receives\nsecurities that can be delivered or pledged as\ncollateral, the firm recognizes the securities\nreceived within securities borrowed and the\nobligation to return those securities within\nsecurities loaned in the consolidated balance\nsheets. The firm receives securities borrowed\nand makes delivery of securities loaned. To\nmitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these securities on a\ndaily basis, and delivers or obtains\nadditional collateral due to changes in the\nmarket value of the securities, as\nappropriate. For securities borrowed\ntransactions, the firm typically requires\ncollateral with a fair value approximately\nequal to the carrying value of the securities\nborrowed transaction. Securities borrowed and\nloaned within FICC financing are recorded at\nfair value under the fair value option. See\nNote 5 for further information about\nsecurities borrowed and loaned accounted for\nat fair value. Substantially all of the\nsecurities borrowed and loaned within Equities\nfinancing are recorded based on the amount of\ncash collateral advanced or received plus\naccrued interest. The firm also reviews such\nsecurities borrowed to determine if an\nallowance for credit losses should be recorded\nby taking into consideration the fair value of\ncollateral received. As these agreements\ngenerally can be terminated on demand, they\nexhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes\nin interest rates. Therefore, the carrying\nvalue of such agreements approximates fair\nvalue. As these agreements are not accounted\nfor at fair value, they are not included in\nthe firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and\n5. Had these agreements been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, they would have\nbeen classified in level 2 as of both March\n2025 and December 2024.\n                                            \n  53    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These\nother secured\nfinancings include: \u2022\nLiabilities of CIEs\nand consolidated VIEs;\n\u2022 Transfers of assets\naccounted for as\nfinancings rather than\nsales (e.g., pledged\ncommodities, bank\nloans and mortgage\nwhole loans); and \u2022\nOther structured\nfinancing\narrangements.

The\nfirm has elected to\napply the fair value\noption to\nsubstantially all\nother secured\nfinancings because the\nuse of fair value\neliminates non-\neconomic volatility in\nearnings that would\narise from using\ndifferent measurement\nattributes. See Note 5\nfor further\ninformation about\nother secured\nfinancings that are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue.

When\nassessing goodwill for impairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment can be made to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not\nthat the estimated fair value of a reporting\nunit is less than its carrying value. If the\nresults of the qualitative assessment are not\nconclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is\nperformed. Alternatively, a quantitative\ngoodwill test can be performed without\nperforming a qualitative assessment.\n\nThe quantitative goodwill test compares the\nestimated fair value of each reporting unit\nwith its carrying value (including goodwill\nand identifiable intangible assets). If the\nreporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value exceeds\nits carrying value, goodwill is not impaired.\nAn impairment is recognized if the estimated\nfair value of a reporting unit is less than\nits carrying value and any such impairment is\nincluded in depreciation and amortization.\nWhen performing a quantitative goodwill test,\nthe estimated fair value of each reporting\nunit is based on valuation techniques the firm\nbelieves market participants would use to\nvalue these reporting units. Estimated fair\nvalues are generally derived from utilizing a\nrelative value technique, which applies\nobservable price-to-earnings multiples or\nprice-to-book multiples of comparable\ncompetitors to the reporting units\u2019 net\nearnings or net book value, or a discounted\ncash flow valuation approach, for reporting\nunits with businesses in early stages of\ndevelopment. The carrying value of each\nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and represents the\nestimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity\nrequired to support the activities of the\nreporting unit under currently applicable\nregulatory capital requirements. In the fourth\nquarter of 2024, the firm performed its annual\nassessment of goodwill for impairment, for\neach of its reporting units with goodwill, by\nperforming a qualitative assessment. Multiple\nfactors, including performance indicators,\nmacroeconomic indicators, firm and industry\nevents, and fair value indicators, were\nassessed with respect to each of these\nreporting units to determine whether it was\nmore likely than not that the estimated fair\nvalue of each of those reporting units was\nless than its carrying value. As a result of\nthe qualitative assessment, the firm\ndetermined that it was more likely than not\nthat the estimated fair value of each\nreporting unit with goodwill exceeded its\nrespective carrying value. Therefore, the firm\ndetermined that goodwill for each reporting\nunit was not impaired and that a quantitative\ngoodwill test was not required. There were no\nevents or changes in circumstances during the\nthree months ended March 2025 that would\nindicate that it was more likely than not that\nthe estimated fair value of each of the\nreporting units with goodwill did not exceed\nits respective carrying value as of March\n2025.\n                                            \n  57    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In\naddition, the firm will recognize an\nimpairment prior to the sale of an asset or\nasset group if the carrying value of the asset\nor asset group exceeds its estimated fair\nvalue.There were no material impairments or\nwrite-downs during either the three months\nended March 2025 or March 2024. Operating\nLease Right-of-Use Assets The firm enters into\noperating leases for real estate, office\nequipment and other assets, substantially all\nof which are used in connection with its\noperations. For leases longer than one year,\nthe firm recognizes a right-of-use asset\nrepresenting the right to use the underlying\nasset for the lease term, and a lease\nliability representing the liability to make\npayments. The lease term is generally\ndetermined based on the contractual maturity\nof the lease. For leases where the firm has\nthe option to terminate or extend the lease,\nan assessment of the likelihood of exercising\nthe option is incorporated into the\ndetermination of the lease term. Such\nassessment is initially performed at the\ninception of the lease and is updated if\nevents occur that impact the original\nassessment. An operating lease right-of-use\nasset is initially determined based on the\noperating lease liability, adjusted for\ninitial direct costs, lease incentives and\namounts paid at or prior to lease\ncommencement. This amount is then amortized\nover the lease term.Right-of-use assets and\noperating lease liabilities recognized (in\nnon-cash transactions for leases entered into\nor assumed) by the firm were not material for\nboth the three months ended March 2025 and\nMarch 2024. See Note 15 for information about\noperating lease liabilities. For leases where\nthe firm will derive no economic benefit from\nleased space that it has vacated or where the\nfirm has shortened the term of a lease when\nspace is no longer needed, the firm will\nrecord an impairment or accelerated\namortization of right-of-use assets.There were\nno material impairments or accelerated\namortizations during either the three months\nended March 2025 or March 2024.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    58  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nfirm acts as\nunderwriter of the\nbeneficial interests\nthat are sold to\ninvestors. The firm\u2019s\nresidential mortgage\nsecuritizations are\nprimarily in\nconnection with\ngovernment agency\nsecuritizations. The\nfirm accounts for a\nsecuritization as a\nsale when it has\nrelinquished control\nover the transferred\nfinancial assets.\nPrior to\nsecuritization, the\nfirm generally\naccounts for assets\npending transfer at\nfair value and\ntherefore does not\ntypically recognize\nsignificant gains or\nlosses upon the\ntransfer of assets.\nNet revenues from\nunderwriting\nactivities are\nrecognized in\nconnection with the\nsales of the\nunderlying beneficial\ninterests to\ninvestors. The firm\ngenerally receives\ncash in exchange for\nthe transferred assets\nbut may also have\ncontinuing involvement\nwith the transferred\nfinancial assets,\nincluding ownership of\nbeneficial interests\nin securitized\nfinancial assets,\nprimarily in the form\nof debt instruments.\nThe firm may also\npurchase senior or\nsubordinated\nsecurities issued by\nsecuritization\nvehicles (which are\ntypically VIEs) in\nconnection with\nsecondary market-\nmaking activities.\n\nThe primary risks\nincluded in beneficial\ninterests and other\ninterests from the\nfirm\u2019s continuing\ninvolvement with\nsecuritization\nvehicles are the\nperformance of the\nunderlying collateral,\nthe position of the\nfirm\u2019s investment in\nthe capital structure\nof the securitization\nvehicle and the market\nyield for the\nsecurity.

The firm\u2019s variable\ninterests in VIEs include senior and\nsubordinated debt; loans and lending\ncommitments; limited and general partnership\ninterests; preferred and common equity;\nderivatives that may include foreign currency,\nequity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and\ncertain of the fees the firm receives from\ninvestment funds. Certain interest rate,\nforeign currency and credit derivatives the\nfirm enters into with VIEs are not variable\ninterests because they create, rather than\nabsorb, risk. VIEs generally finance the\npurchase of assets by issuing debt and equity\nsecurities that are either collateralized by\nor indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The\ndebt and equity securities issued by a VIE may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. The firm\u2019s involvement with\nVIEs includes securitization of financial\nassets, as described in Note 16, and\ninvestments in and loans to other types of\nVIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the\nfirm\u2019s consolidation policies, including the\ndefinition of a VIE. VIE Consolidation\nAnalysis The enterprise with a controlling\nfinancial interest in a VIE is known as the\nprimary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE.\nThe firm determines whether it is the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis\nthat principally considers: \u2022 Which variable\ninterest holder has the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly\nimpact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; \u2022 Which\nvariable interest holder has the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s purpose\nand design, including the risks the VIE was\ndesigned to create and pass through to its\nvariable interest holders; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s capital\nstructure; \u2022 The terms between the VIE and its\nvariable interest holders and other parties\ninvolved with the VIE; and \u2022 Related-party\nrelationships. The firm reassesses its\nevaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when\ncertain reconsideration events occur. The firm\nreassesses its determination of whether it is\nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and\ncircumstances.\n\nVIE Activities The firm is principally\ninvolved with VIEs through the following\nbusiness activities: Mortgage-Backed VIEs. The\nfirm sells residential and commercial mortgage\nloans and securities to mortgage-backed VIEs\nand may retain beneficial interests in the\nassets sold to these VIEs. The firm purchases\nand sells beneficial interests issued by\nmortgage-backed VIEs in connection with\nmarket-making activities. In addition, the\nfirm may enter into derivatives with certain\nof these VIEs, primarily interest rate swaps,\nwhich are typically not variable interests.\nThe firm generally enters into derivatives\nwith other counterparties to mitigate its\nrisk. Tax Credit and Other Investing VIEs .\nThe firm makes equity investments in VIEs that\ninvest in qualified affordable housing and\nrenewable energy projects designed to generate\na return through the realization of tax\ncredits and related tax benefits. The firm\nalso purchases equity and debt securities\nissued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold\nreal estate, performing and nonperforming\ndebt, distressed loans and equity securities.\nIn addition, the firm makes equity investments\nin certain investment fund VIEs it manages and\nis entitled to receive fees from these VIEs.\nThe firm generally does not sell assets to, or\nenter into derivatives with, these VIEs.\nCorporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs.\nThe firm structures VIEs that issue notes to\nclients, purchases and sells beneficial\ninterests issued by corporate debt and other\nasset-backed VIEs in connection with market-\nmaking activities, and makes loans to VIEs\nthat warehouse corporate debt. Certain of\nthese VIEs synthetically create the exposure\nfor the beneficial interests they issue by\nentering into credit derivatives with the\nfirm, rather than purchasing the underlying\nassets. In addition, the firm may enter into\nderivatives, such as total return swaps, with\ncertain corporate debt and other asset-backed\nVIEs, under which the firm pays the VIE a\nreturn due to the beneficial interest holders\nand receives the return on the collateral\nowned by the VIE. The collateral owned by\nthese VIEs is primarily other asset-backed\nloans and securities. The firm may be removed\nas the total return swap counterparty and may\nenter into derivatives with other\ncounterparties to mitigate its risk related to\nthese swaps. The firm may sell assets to the\ncorporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs it\nstructures.\n                                            \n  65    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs\nown portfolios of\nassets, principally\nwith exposure to hedge\nfunds. Substantially\nall of the principal\nprotection on the\nnotes issued by these\nVIEs is provided by\nthe asset portfolio\nrebalancing that is\nrequired under the\nterms of the notes.\nThe firm enters into\ntotal return swaps\nwith these VIEs under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE the return due\nto the principal-\nprotected note holders\nand receives the\nreturn on the assets\nowned by the VIE. The\nfirm may enter into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk. The\nfirm also obtains\nfunding through these\nVIEs.

The firm\nalso extends lending commitments in connection\nwith commercial real estate financing and\nother collateralized lending.See Note 9 for\nfurther information about funded loans. To\nmitigate the credit risk associated with the\nfirm\u2019s commercial lending activities, the firm\nobtains credit protection on certain loans and\nlending commitments through credit default\nswaps, both single-name and index-based\ncontracts.

These arrangements are\ncollateralized by the warehoused assets,\nprimarily consisting of residential real\nestate, consumer and corporate loans. Credit\nCards. The firm provides credit to consumers\nby issuing credit card lines. These credit\ncard lines are cancellable by the firm. Credit\ncard lines included $ 14.39billion as of March\n2025 and $ 14.32billion as of December 2024 of\ncommitments classified as held for sale in\nconnection with the planned sale of the GM co-\nbranded credit card portfolio.

See the\ntables in\n\u201cCommitments\u201d above\nfor a summary of the\nfirm\u2019s commitments.\n\u2022 The carrying value for derivatives included\nderivative assets of $ 548million as of March\n2025 and $ 464million as of December 2024, and\nderivative liabilities of $ 3.74billion as of\nMarch 2025 and $ 4.00billion as of December\n2024.\n\nDerivative Guarantees. The firm enters into\nvarious derivatives that meet the definition\nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including\nwritten equity and commodity put options,\nwritten currency contracts and interest rate\ncaps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives\nare risk managed together with derivatives\nthat do not meet the definition of a\nguarantee, and therefore the amounts in the\ntable above do not reflect the firm\u2019s overall\nrisk related to derivative activities.\nDisclosures about derivatives are not required\nif they may be cash settled and the firm has\nno basis to conclude it is probable that the\ncounterparties held the underlying instruments\nat the inception of the contract. The firm has\nconcluded that these conditions have been met\nfor certain large, internationally active\ncommercial and investment bank counterparties,\ncentral clearing counterparties, hedge funds\nand certain other counterparties. Accordingly,\nthe firm has not included such contracts in\nthe table above. See Note 7 for information\nabout credit derivatives that meet the\ndefinition of a guarantee, which are not\nincluded in the table above. Derivatives are\naccounted for at fair value and therefore the\ncarrying value is considered the best\nindication of payment/performance risk for\nindividual contracts. However, the carrying\nvalues in the table above exclude the effect\nof counterparty and cash collateral netting.\nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees .\nSecurities lending and clearing guarantees\ninclude the indemnifications and guarantees\nthat the firm provides in its capacity as an\nagency lender and in its capacity as a\nsponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. As an agency lender, the firm\nindemnifies most of its securities lending\ncustomers against losses incurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not return securities and\nthe collateral held is insufficient to cover\nthe market value of the securities\nborrowed.The maximum payout of such\nindemnifications was $ 12.64billion as of\nMarch 2025 and $ 10.62billion as of December\n2024. Collateral held by the lenders in\nconnection with securities lending\nindemnifications was $ 13.17 billionas of\nMarch 2025 and $ 11.02 billionas of December\n2024. Because the contractual nature of these\narrangements requires the firm to obtain\ncollateral with a market value that exceeds\nthe value of the securities lent to the\nborrower, there is minimal performance risk\nassociated with these indemnifications.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    70  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nAs a sponsoring member of the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the\nperformance of its sponsored member clients to\nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in\nconnection with certain resale and repurchase\nagreements. To minimize potential losses on\nsuch guarantees, the firm obtains a security\ninterest in the collateral that the sponsored\nclient placed with the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on\nsuch guarantees is minimal. The maximum payout\non this guarantee was $ 90.01billion as of\nMarch 2025 and $ 47.44billion as of December\n2024. The related collateral held was $ 88.63\nbillionas of March 2025 and $ 46.96 billionas\nof December 2024. Other Financial Guarantees .\nIn the ordinary course of business, the firm\nprovides other financial guarantees of the\nobligations of third parties (e.g., standby\nletters of credit and other guarantees to\nenable clients to complete transactions and\nfund-related guarantees). These guarantees\nrepresent obligations to make payments to\nbeneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to\nfulfill its obligation under a contractual\narrangement with that beneficiary.Other\nfinancial guarantees also include a guarantee\nthat the firm has provided to the Government\nof Malaysia that it will receive, by August\n2025, at least $ 1.4billion in assets and\nproceeds from assets seized by governmental\nauthorities around the world related to\n1Malaysia Development Berhad, a sovereign\nwealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In connection\nwith this guarantee, the firm agreed to make a\none-time interim payment of $ 250million\ntowards the $ 1.4billion if the Government of\nMalaysia did not receive at least $ 500million\nin assets and proceeds by August 2022. The\nfirm does not believe that any interim payment\nis required. Any amounts paid by the firm\nwould, in any event, be subject to\nreimbursement in the event the assets and\nproceeds received by the Government of\nMalaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed $\n1.4billion. On October 11, 2023, the firm\nfiled a demand for arbitration alleging that\nthe Government of Malaysia had, as of August\n2022, recovered assets and proceeds well in\nexcess of $ 500million; it had recovered\nsubstantial additional assets and proceeds\nthat should be credited against the guarantee;\nand it had not used all reasonable efforts to\nrecover other assets and proceeds that cou ld\nbe credited against the guarantee. On November\n8, 2023, the Government of Malaysia filed a\nresponse to the firm\u2019s demand for arbitration\nand on June 10, 2024, filed an application for\na partial award to immediately enforce the\ninterim payment (plus interest). On July 24,\n2024, the arbitral tribunal rejected that\napplication. Final determinations on all\nremaining issues, including any subsequent\nenforcement of the interim payment, are to be\nmade at a final hearing. The arbitral process\nis ongoing. See Note 27 for further\ninformation about matters related to 1MDB.\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The\nfirm has established trusts, including Goldman\nSachs Capital I, Goldman Sachs Capital II and\nGoldman Sachs Capital III (the Trusts), and\nother entities, for the limited purpose of\nissuing securities to third parties, lending\nthe proceeds to the firm and entering into\ncontractual arrangements with the firm and\nthird parties related to this purpose. The\nfirm does not consolidate these entities. See\nNotes 14 and 19 for further information about\nthe transactions involving the Trusts. The\nfirm effectively provides for the full and\nunconditional guarantee of the securities\nissued by these entities. Timely payment by\nthe firm of amounts due to these entities\nunder the guarantee, borrowing, preferred\nstock and related contractual arrangements\nwill be sufficient to cover payments due on\nthe securities issued by these entities. No\nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the\nsecurities of the Trusts. Management believes\nthat it is unlikely that any circumstances\nwill occur, such as nonperformance on the part\nof paying agents or other service providers,\nthat would make it necessary for the firm to\nmake payments related to these entities other\nthan those required under the terms of the\nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and\nrelated contractual arrangements and in\nconnection with certain expenses incurred by\nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of\nService Providers. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees\ncertain service providers, such as clearing\nand custody agents, trustees and\nadministrators, against specified potential\nlosses in connection with their acting as an\nagent of, or providing services to, the firm\nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses\narising from its custodial role or caused by\nacts or omissions of third-party service\nproviders, including sub-custodians and third-\nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has\nthe right to seek indemnification from these\nthird-party service providers for certain\nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In\naddition, the firm is a member of payment,\nclearing and settlement networks, as well as\nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of\nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of\nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In\nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear\nand settle transactions entered into by\nclients with other brokerage firms. The firm\u2019s\nobligations in respect of such transactions\nare secured by the assets in the client\u2019s\naccount and proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the firm\non behalf of the client. In connection with\njoint venture investments, the firm may issue\nloan guarantees under which it may be liable\nin the event of fraud, misappropriation,\nenvironmental liabilities and other matters\ninvolving the borrower.\n                                            \n  71    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nThe firm is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder these guarantees\nand indemnifications\nas this depends upon\nthe occurrence of\nfuture events,\nincluding an\nassessment of claims\nthat have not yet\noccurred. However,\nmanagement believes\nthat it is unlikely\nthe firm will have to\nmake any material\npayments under these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\nguarantees and\nindemnifications have\nbeen recognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both\nMarch 2025 and\nDecember 2024. Other\nRepresentations,\nWarranties and\nIndemnifications. The\nfirm provides\nrepresentations and\nwarranties to\ncounterparties in\nconnection with a\nvariety of commercial\ntransactions and\noccasionally\nindemnifies them\nagainst potential\nlosses caused by the\nbreach of those\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. The firm\nmay also provide\nindemnifications\nprotecting against\nchanges in or adverse\napplication of certain\nU.S. tax laws in\nconnection with\nordinary-course\ntransactions, such as\nsecurities issuances,\nborrowings or\nderivatives. In\naddition, the firm may\nprovide\nindemnifications to\nsome counterparties to\nprotect them in the\nevent additional taxes\nare owed or payments\nare withheld, due\neither to a change in\nor an adverse\napplication of certain\nnon-U.S. tax laws.\nThese\nindemnifications, as\nwell as\nindemnifications\nprovided by the firm\non other contractual\nor other obligations,\ngenerally are standard\ncontractual terms and\nare entered into in\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness. Generally,\nthere are no stated or\nnotional amounts\nincluded in these\nindemnifications, and\nthe contingencies\ntriggering the\nobligation to\nindemnify are not\nexpected to occur.\nFuture changes in tax\nlaws and how such laws\nwould apply to these\nindemnifications\ncannot be determined.\nTherefore, the firm is\nunable to develop an\nestimate of the\nmaximum payout under\nthese guarantees and\nindemnifications.\nHowever, management\nbelieves that it is\nunlikely the firm will\nhave to make any\nmaterial payments\nunder these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\narrangements have been\nrecognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both\nMarch 2025 and\nDecember 2024.\nGuarantees of\nSubsidiaries. Group\nInc. is the entity\nthat fully and\nunconditionally\nguarantees the\nsecurities issued by\nGS Finance Corp., a\nwholly-owned finance\nsubsidiary of the\nfirm. Group Inc. has\nguaranteed the payment\nobligations of Goldman\nSachs & Co. LLC\n(GS&Co.), GS Bank USA\nand Goldman Sachs\nParis Inc. et Cie,\nsubject to certain\nexceptions. Group Inc.\nalso guarantees many\nof the obligations of\nits other consolidated\nsubsidiaries on a\ntransaction-by-\ntransaction basis, as\nnegotiated with\ncounterparties.

Regulation\nand Capital Adequacy\nThe FRB is the primary\nregulator of Group\nInc., a bank holding\ncompany under the U.S.\nBank Holding Company\nAct of 1956 and a\nfinancial holding\ncompany under\namendments to this\nAct. The firm is\nsubject to\nconsolidated\nregulatory capital\nrequirements which are\ncalculated in\naccordance with the\nregulations of the FRB\n(Capital Framework).\nThe capital\nrequirements are\nexpressed as risk-\nbased capital and\nleverage ratios that\ncompare measures of\nregulatory capital to\nrisk-weighted assets\n(RWAs), average assets\nand off-balance sheet\nexposures. Failure to\ncomply with these\ncapital requirements\nwould result in\nrestrictions being\nimposed by the firm\u2019s\nregulators and could\nlimit the firm\u2019s\nability to repurchase\nshares, pay dividends\nand make certain\ndiscretionary\ncompensation payments.\nThe firm\u2019s capital\nlevels are also\nsubject to qualitative\njudgments by the\nregulators about\ncomponents of capital,\nrisk weightings and\nother factors.\nFurthermore, certain\nof the firm\u2019s\nsubsidiaries are\nsubject to separate\nregulations and\ncapital requirements.\nCapital Framework The\nregulations under the\nCapital Framework are\nlargely based on the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\u2019s\n(Basel Committee)\ncapital framework for\nstrengthening\ninternational capital\nstandards (Basel III)\nand also implement\ncertain provisions of\nthe U.S. Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection\nAct. Under the Capital\nFramework, the firm is\nan \u201cAdvanced\napproaches\u201d banking\norganization and has\nbeen designated as a\nglobal systemically\nimportant bank\n(G-SIB). The Capital\nFramework includes the\nminimum risk-based\ncapital and the\ncapital conservation\nbuffer requirements.\nThe buffer must\nconsist entirely of\ncapital that qualifies\nas Common Equity Tier\n1 (CET1) capital. The\nfirm calculates its\nCET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total\ncapital ratios in\naccordance with both\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules. Each of the\nratios calculated\nunder the Standardized\nand Advanced Capital\nRules must meet its\nrespective capital\nrequirements. Under\nthe Capital Framework,\nthe firm is also\nsubject to leverage\nrequirements which\nconsist of a minimum\nTier 1 leverage ratio\nand a minimum\nsupplementary leverage\nratio (SLR), as well\nas the SLR buffer.\n\nConsolidated\nRegulatory Capital\nRequirements Risk-\nBased Capital Ratios.\nThe table below\npresents the risk-\nbased capital\nrequirements.\n                                              \n                   Standar\u2026          Advanc\u2026  \n  As of                                       \n  March                                       \n  2025                                        \n  CET1                                        \n  capital    13.7  %           10.0  %        \n  ratio                                       \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capital    15.2  %           11.5  %        \n  ratio                                       \n  Total                                       \n  capital    17.2  %           13.5  %        \n  ratio                                       \n  As of                                       \n  Decemb\u2026                                     \n  2024                                        \n  CET1                                        \n  capital    13.7  %           10.0  %        \n  ratio                                       \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capital    15.2  %           11.5  %        \n  ratio                                       \n  Total                                       \n  capital    17.2  %           13.5  %        \n  ratio                                       \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\n\u2022 Under both the Standardized and Advanced\nCapital Rules, the CET1 capital ratio\nrequirement includes a minimum of 4.5%, the\nTier 1 capital ratio requirement includes a\nminimum of 6.0% and the Total capital ratio\nrequirement includes a minimum of 8.0%. These\nrequirements also include the capital\nconservation buffer requirements, consisting\nof the G-SIB surcharge (Method 2) of 3.0% and\nthe countercyclical capital buffer, which the\nFRB has set to zero percent. In addition, the\ncapital conservation buffer requirements\ninclude the stress capital buffer (SCB) of\n6.2% under the Standardized Capital Rules and\na buffer of 2.5% under the Advanced Capital\nRules.\n\n\u2022 The G-SIB surcharge is updated annually\nbased on financial data from the prior year\nand is generally applicable for the following\nyear. The G-SIB surcharge is calculated using\ntwo methodologies, the higher of which is\nreflected in the firm\u2019s risk-based capital\nrequirements.

RWAs are calculated in accordance with\nboth the Standardized and Advanced Capital\nRules. Credit Risk Credit RWAs are calculated\nbased on measures of exposure, which are then\nrisk weighted under the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules: \u2022 The Standardized\nCapital Rules apply prescribed risk-weights,\nwhich depend largely on the type of\ncounterparty. The exposure measures for\nderivatives and securities financing\ntransactions are based on specific formulas\nwhich take certain factors into consideration.\n\n\u2022 Under the Advanced Capital Rules, the firm\ncomputes risk-weights for wholesale and retail\ncredit exposures in accordance with the\nAdvanced Internal Ratings-Based approach. The\nexposure measures for derivatives and\nsecurities financing transactions are computed\nutilizing internal models. \u2022 For both\nStandardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the\nrisk-weights for securitizations and equities\nare based on specific required formulaic\napproaches. Market Risk RWAs for market risk\nin accordance with the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules are generally\nconsistent. Market RWAs are calculated based\non measures of exposure which include the\nfollowing: \u2022 Value-at-Risk (VaR) is the\npotential loss in value of trading assets and\nliabilities, as well as certain investments,\nloans, and other financial assets and\nliabilities accounted for at fair value, due\nto adverse market movements over a defined\ntime horizon with a specified confidence\nlevel. For both risk management purposes and\nregulatory capital calculations, the firm uses\na single VaR model which captures risks,\nincluding those related to interest rates,\nequity prices, currency rates and commodity\nprices. However, VaR used for risk management\npurposes differs from VaR used for regulatory\ncapital requirements (regulatory VaR) due to\ndifferences in time horizons, confidence\nlevels and the scope of positions on which VaR\nis calculated. For risk management purposes, a\n95% one-dayVaR is used, whereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements, a 99% 10-dayVaR is used\nto determine Market RWAs and a 99% one-dayVaR\nis used to determine regulatory VaR\nexceptions. In addition, the daily net\nrevenues used to determine risk management VaR\nexceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net\nrevenues to the VaR measure calculated as of\nthe end of the prior business day) include\nintraday activity, whereas the Capital\nFramework requires that intraday activity be\nexcluded from daily net revenues when\ncalculating regulatory VaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity includes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are more likely than not to be\npositive by their nature. As a result, there\nmay be differences in the number of VaR\nexceptions and the amount of daily net\nrevenues calculated for regulatory VaR\ncompared to the amounts calculated for risk\nmanagement VaR.

GS\nBank USA GS Bank USA is the firm\u2019s primary\nU.S. bank subsidiary. GS Bank USA is a New\nYork State-chartered bank and a member of the\nFederal Reserve System, is supervised and\nregulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York\nState Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)\nand the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n(CFPB), and is subject to regulatory capital\nrequirements that are calculated under the\nCapital Framework. GS Bank USA is an \u201cAdvanced\napproaches\u201d banking organization under the\nCapital Framework. The deposits of GS Bank USA\nare insured by the FDIC to the extent provided\nby law. The Capital Framework includes the\nminimum risk-based capital and the capital\nconservation buffer requirements (consisting\nof a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical\ncapital buffer). The buffer must consist\nentirely of capital that qualifies as CET1\ncapital. In addition, the Capital Framework\nincludes the leverage ratio requirement. GS\nBank USA is required to calculate the CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital\nratios in accordance with both the\nStandardized and Advanced Capital Rules. The\nlower of each risk-based capital ratio under\nthe Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules is\nthe ratio against which GS Bank USA\u2019s\ncompliance with its risk-based capital\nrequirements is assessed. In addition, under\nthe regulatory framework for prompt corrective\naction applicable to GS Bank USA, in order to\nmeet the quantitative requirements for a\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d depository institution, GS\nBank USA must also meet the \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nrequirements in the table below. GS Bank USA\u2019s\ncapital levels and prompt corrective action\nclassification are also subject to qualitative\njudgments by the regulators about components\nof capital, risk weightings and other factors.\nFailure to comply with the capital\nrequirements, including a breach of the\nbuffers described below, would result in\nrestrictions being imposed by the regulators.\nThe table below\npresents GS Bank USA\u2019s\nrisk-based capital,\nleverage and \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d\nrequirements.\n                                              \n       As                                     \n       of                                     \n           M\u2026        D\u2026        M\u2026        De\u2026  \n           2\u2026        2\u2026        2\u2026        20\u2026  \n                           \"\u2026                 \n       R\u2026                  R\u2026                 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    7\u2026   %    7\u2026   %    6\u2026   %    6\u2026    %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  1    8\u2026   %    8\u2026   %    8\u2026   %    8\u2026    %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    1\u2026   %    1\u2026   %    1\u2026   %    1\u2026    %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  1    4\u2026   %    4\u2026   %    5\u2026   %    5\u2026    %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    3\u2026   %    3\u2026   %    6\u2026   %    6\u2026    %  \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 The CET1 capital\nratio requirement\nincludes a minimum of\n4.5%, the Tier 1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement includes a\nminimum of 6.0% and\nthe Total capital\nratio requirement\nincludes a minimum of\n8.0%.

These\nlimitations include provisions of applicable\nlaw and regulations and other regulatory\nrestrictions that limit the ability of those\nsubsidiaries to declare and pay dividends\nwithout prior regulatory approval. For\nexample, the amount of dividends that may be\npaid by GS Bank USA are limited to the lesser\nof the amounts calculated under a recent\nearnings test and an undivided profits test.\nIn addition, subsidiaries not subject to\nseparate regulatory capital requirements may\nhold capital to satisfy local tax and legal\nguidelines, rating agency requirements (for\nentities with assigned credit ratings) or\ninternal policies, including policies\nconcerning the minimum amount of capital a\nsubsidiary should hold based on its underlying\nlevel of risk. Group Inc.\u2019s equity investment\nin subsidiaries was $ 145.39billion as of\nMarch 2025 and $ 140.79billion as of December\n2024. The firm's regulated subsidiaries were\nrequired to hold minimum equity capital of $\n102.81billion as of March 2025 and $\n98.48billion as of December 2024 to satisfy\nregulatory requirements. Group Inc.\u2019s capital\ninvested in certain non-U.S. dollar functional\ncurrency subsidiaries is exposed to foreign\nexchange risk, substantially all of which is\nmanaged through a combination of non-U.S.\ndollar-denominated debt and derivatives.

Income Taxes Provision for Income\nTaxes Income taxes are provided for using the\nasset and liability method under which\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. The firm reports\ninterest expense related to income tax matters\nin provision for taxes and income tax\npenalties in other expenses. Deferred Income\nTaxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net\ntax effects of temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. These temporary\ndifferences result in taxable or deductible\namounts in future years and are measured using\nthe tax rates and laws that will be in effect\nwhen such differences are expected to reverse.\nValuation allowances are established to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount that more\nlikely than not will be realized and primarily\nrelate to the ability to utilize losses and\ntax credits in various tax jurisdictions. Tax\nassets are included in other assets and tax\nliabilities are included in other liabilities.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits The firm recognizes\ntax positions in the consolidated financial\nstatements only when it is more likely than\nnot that the position will be sustained on\nexamination by the relevant taxing authority\nbased on the technical merits of the position.\nA position that meets this standard is\nmeasured at the largest amount of benefit that\nwill more likely than not be realized on\nsettlement. A liability is established for\ndifferences between positions taken in a tax\nreturn and amounts recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Regulatory\nTax Examinations The firm is subject to\nexamination by the U.S. Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) and other taxing authorities in\njurisdictions where the firm has significant\nbusiness operations, such as the United\nKingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states,\nsuch as New York. The tax years under\nexamination vary by jurisdiction. The firm\ndoes not expect completion of these audits to\nhave a material impact on the firm\u2019s financial\ncondition, but it may be material to operating\nresults for a particular period, depending, in\npart, on the operating results for that\nperiod.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    82  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

All issues\nfor the 2019 through\n2022 tax years have\nbeen resolved and will\nbe effectively settled\npending administrative\ncompletion by the IRS.\nFinal completion of\ntax years 2011 through\n2022 will not have a\nmaterial impact on the\neffective tax rate.\nThe 2023 tax year\nremains subject to\npost-filing review.\nNew York State and\nCity examinations of\ntax years 2015 through\n2018 commenced during\n2021.\n\nAll years, including\nand subsequent to the\nyears in the table\nabove, remain open to\nexamination by the\ntaxing authorities.\nThe firm believes that\nthe liability for\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits it has\nestablished is\nadequate in relation\nto the potential for\nadditional\nassessments.\nNote 25. Business Segments The firm manages\nand reports its activities in threebusiness\nsegments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset &\nWealth Management and Platform Solutions.\nThese business segments are determined and\norganized based on products and services\nprovided, and the types of customers and\ncounterparties served. See Note 1 for a\ndescription of the firm\u2019s business segments.\nThe firm\u2019s chief operating decision maker\n(CODM) is its president and chief operating\nofficer. The CODM makes operating decisions,\nassesses the performance of, and allocates\nresources to, the firm\u2019s operating segments\nprincipally based on the total net revenues of\nthe segments, revenues net of provision for\ncredit losses, total operating expenses, pre-\ntax earnings, net earnings applicable to\ncommon shareholders and the return on average\ncommon equity to assess the performance of the\nsegments. The CODM evaluates segment operating\nperformance against the firm\u2019s targets and\nindustry metrics and considers the current and\nfuture business and operating environment.\n\nThe accounting policies used to prepare the\noperating results and other metrics for the\nsegments are consistent with those described\nin Note 3. The following provides a\ndescription of the primary components of the\nfirm\u2019s segment results disclosed in the table\nbelow. \u2022 The firm fully allocates its\nrevenues, expenses, assets and shareholders\u2019\nequity to the firm\u2019s threebusiness segments. \u2022\nRevenues and expenses directly associated with\neach segment are included in determining pre-\ntax earnings for the respective segment. \u2022 Net\nrevenues in the firm\u2019s segments include\nallocations of interest income and interest\nexpense based on the funding generated by, or\nthe funding and liquidity requirements of the\nrespective segments. Net interest is included\nin segment net revenues as it is consistent\nwith how management assesses segment\nperformance. \u2022 Expenses not directly\nassociated with specific segments are\nallocated among the business segments based on\nan estimate of support provided to each\nsegment. \u2022 Compensation and benefits expenses\nin the firm\u2019s segments reflect, among other\nfactors, the overall performance of the firm,\nas well as the performance of individual\nbusinesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in\none segment of the firm\u2019s business may be\nsignificantly affected by the performance of\nthe firm\u2019s other business segments. \u2022 Certain\nassets (including allocations of global core\nliquid assets and cash, and secured client\nfinancing), not directly associated with\nspecific segments are generally allocated\namong the business segments based on the\nfunding and liquidity requirements of the\nsegments. \u2022 Common shareholders\u2019 equity and\npreferred stock dividends are allocated to\neach segment based on the estimated amount of\nequity required to support the activities of\nthe segment under relevant regulatory capital\nrequirements. \u2022 Net earnings for each segment\nis calculated by applying the firmwide tax\nrate to each segment\u2019s pre-tax earnings. \u2022\nManagement believes that this allocation\nprovides a reasonable representation of each\nsegment\u2019s contribution to consolidated net\nearnings to common, return on average common\nequity and total assets. Due to the integrated\nnature of these segments, estimates and\njudgments are made in allocating these assets,\nrevenues and expenses. Transactions between\nsegments are based on specific criteria or\napproximate third-party rates.\n                                            \n  83    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These\nactivities expose the\nfirm to many different\nindustries and\ncounterparties, and\nmay also subject the\nfirm to a\nconcentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular central\nbank, counterparty,\nborrower or issuer,\nincluding sovereign\nissuers, or to a\nparticular\nclearinghouse or\nexchange. The firm\nseeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by\nactively monitoring\nexposures and\nobtaining collateral\nfrom counterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm\nconsiders when\ndetermining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts. Netting and\ncollateral agreements\npermit the firm to\noffset receivables and\npayables with such\ncounterparties and/or\nenable the firm to\nobtain collateral on\nan upfront or\ncontingent basis.\nThe table below\npresents the credit\nconcentrations\nincluded in trading\ncash instruments and\ninvestments.\n                                              \n  $ in               March            Decem\u2026  \n  mil\u2026        As of  2025             2024    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S.                                        \n  gov\u2026                                        \n  and     $  394,5\u2026         $  389,\u2026          \n  age\u2026                                        \n  obl\u2026                                        \n  Per\u2026                                        \n  of           22.3  %          23.2  %       \n  tot\u2026                                        \n  ass\u2026                                        \n  Non\u2026                                        \n  gov\u2026                                        \n  and     $  95,814         $  74,4\u2026          \n  age\u2026                                        \n  obl\u2026                                        \n  Per\u2026                                        \n  of            5.4  %           4.4  %       \n  tot\u2026                                        \n  ass\u2026                                        \n                                              \nIn addition, the firm\nhad $ 138.32billion as\nof March 2025 and $\n151.84billion as of\nDecember 2024 of cash\ndeposits held at\ncentral banks\n(included in cash and\ncash equivalents), of\nwhich $ 82.69billion\nas of March 2025 and $\n105.78billion as of\nDecember 2024 was held\nat the Federal\nReserve.\nAs of both March 2025\nand December 2024, the\nfirm did not have\ncredit exposure to any\nother counterparty\nthat exceeded 2% of\ntotal assets.\n                                            \n  85    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Legal Proceedings The firm is\ninvolved in a number of judicial, regulatory\nand arbitration proceedings (including those\ndescribed below) concerning matters arising in\nconnection with the conduct of the firm\u2019s\nbusinesses.

The\ncomplaints in the individual actions also\nassert claims under state antitrust law. The\ncomplaints seek declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, as well as treble damages in an\nunspecified amount. Defendants moved to\ndismiss the class and the first individual\naction and the district court dismissed the\nstate common law claims asserted by the\nplaintiffs in the first individual action and\notherwise limited the state common law claim\nin the putative class action and the antitrust\nclaims in both actions to the period from 2013\nto 2016. On November 20, 2018, the court\ngranted in part and denied in part the\ndefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the second\nindividual action, dismissing the state common\nlaw claims for unjust enrichment and tortious\ninterference, but denying dismissal of the\nfederal and state antitrust claims. On March\n13, 2019, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion in the putative class action to amend\ntheir complaint to add allegations related to\nconduct from 2008 to 2012, but granted the\nmotion to add limited allegations from 2013 to\n2016, which the plaintiffs added in a fourth\nconsolidated amended complaint filed on March\n22, 2019. On December 15, 2023, the court\ndenied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class\ncertification, and on December 28, 2023, the\nplaintiffs filed a petition with the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nseeking interlocutory review of the district\ncourt\u2019s denial of class certification. On July\n11, 2024, the court preliminarily approved a\nsettlement among the plaintiffs and certain\ndefendants, including the firm, to resolve the\nclass action. The firm has paid the full\namount of its proposed contribution to the\nsettlement into an escrow account.

The amended consolidated complaint,\nfiled on October 29, 2020, asserts claims\nunder federal antitrust law in connection with\nalleged anti-competitive conduct by the\ndefendants in the secondary market for odd-\nlots of corporate bonds, and seeks declaratory\nand injunctive relief, as well as unspecified\nmonetary damages, including treble and\npunitive damages and restitution. On October\n25, 2021, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion\nto dismiss with prejudice. On November 10,\n2022, the district court denied the\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for an indicative ruling\nthat the judgment should be vacated because\nthe wife of the district judge owned stock in\none of the defendants and the district judge\ndid not recuse himself. On July 2, 2024, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nvacated the district court\u2019s dismissal and\nremanded the case for further proceedings. On\nSeptember 3, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a\nsecond amended complaint, and on October 18,\n2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the\nsecond amended complaint. Credit Default Swap\nAntitrust Litigation Group Inc., GS&Co. and\nGSI were among the defendants named in a\nputative antitrust class action relating to\nthe settlement of credit default swaps, filed\non June 30, 2021 in the U.S. District Court\nfor the District of New Mexico. The complaint\ngenerally asserts claims under federal\nantitrust law and the Commodity Exchange Act\nin connection with an alleged conspiracy among\nthe defendants to manipulate the benchmark\nprice used to value credit default swaps for\nsettlement. The complaint also asserts a claim\nfor unjust enrichment under state common law.\nThe complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, as well as unspecified amounts of\ntreble and other damages. On November 15,\n2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss\nthe complaint. On February 4, 2022, the\nplaintiffs filed an amended complaint and\nvoluntarily dismissed Group Inc. from the\naction. On June 5, 2023, the court dismissed\nthe claims against certain foreign defendants\nfor lack of personal jurisdiction but denied\nthe defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss with respect\nto GS&Co., GSI and the remaining defendants.\nOn January 24, 2024, the court granted the\ndefendants\u2019 motion to stay the proceedings\npending the resolution of the motion filed by\nthe defendants on November 3, 2023 in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nNew York to enforce a 2015 settlement and\nrelease among the parties. On January 26,\n2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York granted the defendants\u2019\nmotion to enforce the settlement and release\nand enjoined the plaintiffs from pursuing any\nclaims against the defendants in the New\nMexico action for any alleged violation of law\nbased on conduct before June 30, 2014, and on\nFebruary 23, 2024, the plaintiffs appealed to\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit.

The use of\nfair value to measure\nfinancial instruments\nis fundamental to our\nrisk management\npractices and is our\nmost critical\naccounting policy.\n\nThe fair value of a\nfinancial instrument\nis the amount that\nwould be received to\nsell an asset or paid\nto transfer a\nliability in an\norderly transaction\nbetween market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date. We\nmeasure certain\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based\non its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit\nrisks). In determining\nfair value, the\nhierarchy under U.S.\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles\n(U.S. GAAP) gives (i)\nthe highest priority\nto unadjusted quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets for identical,\nunrestricted assets or\nliabilities (level 1\ninputs), (ii) the next\npriority to inputs\nother than level 1\ninputs that are\nobservable, either\ndirectly or indirectly\n(level 2 inputs), and\n(iii) the lowest\npriority to inputs\nthat cannot be\nobserved in market\nactivity (level 3\ninputs). In evaluating\nthe significance of a\nvaluation input, we\nconsider, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s\nnet risk exposure to\nthat input. Assets and\nliabilities are\nclassified in their\nentirety based on the\nlowest level of input\nthat is significant to\ntheir fair value\nmeasurement.\n\nThe fair values for\nsubstantially all of\nour financial assets\nand liabilities are\nbased on observable\nprices and inputs and\nare classified in\nlevels 1 and 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\nCertain level 2 and\nlevel 3 financial\nassets and liabilities\nmay require\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments that a\nmarket participant\nwould require to\narrive at fair value\nfor factors, such as\ncounterparty and our\ncredit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer\nrestrictions,\nliquidity and\nbid/offer spreads.\n\nInstruments classified\nin level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy are\nthose which require\none or more\nsignificant inputs\nthat are not\nobservable. Level 3\nfinancial assets\nrepresented 1.2% as of\nboth March 2025 and\nDecember 2024 of our\ntotal assets. See\nNotes 4 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\nlevel 3 financial\nassets, including\nchanges in level 3\nfinancial assets and\nrelated fair value\nmeasurements. Absent\nevidence to the\ncontrary, instruments\nclassified in level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy are\ninitially valued at\ntransaction price,\nwhich is considered to\nbe the best initial\nestimate of fair\nvalue. Subsequent to\nthe transaction date,\nwe use other\nmethodologies to\ndetermine fair value,\nwhich vary based on\nthe type of\ninstrument. Estimating\nthe fair value of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstruments requires\njudgments to be made.\nThese judgments\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Determining the\nappropriate valuation\nmethodology and/or\nmodel for each type of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstrument;\n\n\u2022 Determining model\ninputs based on an\nevaluation of all\nrelevant empirical\nmarket data, including\nprices evidenced by\nmarket transactions,\ninterest rates, credit\nspreads, volatilities\nand correlations; and\n\n\u2022 Determining\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments, including\nthose related to\nilliquidity or\ncounterparty credit\nquality.\n\nRegardless of the\nmethodology, valuation\ninputs and assumptions\nare only changed when\ncorroborated by\nsubstantive evidence.\n                                             \n  103    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Market\nmakers and investment\nprofessionals in our\nrevenue-producing\nunits are responsible\nfor pricing our\nfinancial instruments.\nOur control\ninfrastructure is\nindependent of the\nrevenue-producing\nunits and is\nfundamental to\nensuring that all of\nour financial\ninstruments are\nappropriately valued\nat market-clearing\nlevels. In the event\nthat there is a\ndifference of opinion\nin situations where\nestimating the fair\nvalue of financial\ninstruments requires\njudgment (e.g.,\ncalibration to market\ncomparables or trade\ncomparison, as\ndescribed below), the\nfinal valuation\ndecision is made by\nsenior managers in our\nindependent price\nverification function\nwithin Controllers.\nThis independent price\nverification is\ncritical to ensuring\nthat our financial\ninstruments are\nproperly valued.\n\nPrice Verification.\nAll financial\ninstruments at fair\nvalue classified in\nlevels 1, 2 and 3 of\nthe fair value\nhierarchy are subject\nto our independent\nprice verification\nprocess. The objective\nof price verification\nis to have an informed\nand independent\nopinion with regard to\nthe valuation of\nfinancial instruments\nunder review.\nInstruments that have\none or more\nsignificant inputs\nwhich cannot be\ncorroborated by\nexternal market data\nare classified in\nlevel 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Price\nverification\nstrategies utilized by\nour independent price\nverification function\nwithin Controllers\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Trade Comparison.\nAnalysis of trade data\n(both internal and\nexternal, where\navailable) is used to\ndetermine the most\nrelevant pricing\ninputs and valuations.\n\n\u2022 External Price\nComparison. Valuations\nand prices are\ncompared to pricing\ndata obtained from\nthird parties (e.g.,\nbrokers or dealers,\nS&P Global Services,\nBloomberg, ICE Data\nServices, Pricing\nDirect, TRACE). Data\nobtained from various\nsources is compared to\nensure consistency and\nvalidity. When broker\nor dealer quotations\nor third-party pricing\nvendors are used for\nvaluation or price\nverification, greater\npriority is generally\ngiven to executable\nquotations.\n\n\u2022 Calibration to\nMarket Comparables.\nMarket-based\ntransactions are used\nto corroborate the\nvaluation of positions\nwith similar\ncharacteristics, risks\nand components.\n\n\u2022 Relative Value\nAnalyses.

The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude multiple\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. We\napply judgment in\nweighting individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including our\ninternally derived\neconomic outlook,\nmarket consensus,\nrecent macroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios. Risk\nfactors for wholesale\nloans include internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators (e.g.,\nunemployment rates and\nGDP), the borrower\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its\nfinancial obligations,\nthe borrower\u2019s country\nof risk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. In\naddition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nthe loan-to-value\nratio, debt service\nratio and home price\nindex. The allowance\nfor loan losses for\nwholesale loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics,\nsuch as nonaccrual\nloans, is calculated\nusing the present\nvalue of expected\nfuture cash flows\ndiscounted at the\nloan\u2019s effective rate,\nthe observable market\nprice of the loan, or,\nin the case of\ncollateral dependent\nloans, the fair value\nof the collateral less\nestimated costs to\nsell, if applicable.\nRisk factors for\ncredit card loans\ninclude Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO)\ncredit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators.\n\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses also\nincludes qualitative\ncomponents which allow\nmanagement to reflect\nthe uncertain nature\nof economic\nforecasting, capture\nuncertainty regarding\nmodel inputs, and\naccount for model\nimprecision and\nconcentration risk.\nThe qualitative\nfactors considered by\nmanagement include,\namong others, changes\nand trends in loan\nportfolios,\nuncertainties\nassociated with the\nmacroeconomic and\ngeopolitical\nenvironments, credit\nconcentrations,\nchanges in volume and\nseverity of past due\nand criticized loans,\nidiosyncratic events\nand deterioration\nwithin an industry or\nregion. Our estimate\nof credit losses\nentails judgment about\ncollectability at the\nreporting dates, and\nthere are\nuncertainties inherent\nin those judgments.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses is\nsubject to a\ngovernance process\nthat involves senior\nmanagement within Risk\nand Controllers.\nPersonnel within Risk\nare responsible for\nforecasting the\neconomic variables\nthat underlie the\neconomic scenarios\nthat are used in the\nmodeling of expected\ncredit losses. While\nwe use the best\ninformation available\nto determine this\nestimate, future\nadjustments to the\nallowance may be\nnecessary based on,\namong other things,\nchanges in the\neconomic environment\nor variances between\nactual results and the\noriginal assumptions\nused. Loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\n\nWe also record an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on lending\ncommitments which are\nheld for investment\nthat are accounted for\nat amortized cost.\nSuch allowance is\ndetermined using the\nsame methodology as\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses, while also\ntaking into\nconsideration the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding,\nand whether such\ncommitments are\ncancellable by us.\n\nTo estimate the\npotential impact of an\nadverse macroeconomic\nenvironment on our\nallowance for credit\nlosses, we, among\nother things, compared\nthe expected credit\nlosses under the\nweighted average\nforecast used in the\ncalculation of\nallowance for credit\nlosses as of March\n2025 (which was\nweighted towards the\nbaseline and adverse\neconomic scenarios) to\nthe expected credit\nlosses under a 100%\nweighted adverse\neconomic scenario. The\nadverse economic\nscenario of the\nforecast model\nreflects a global\nrecession in the\nsecond quarter of 2025\nthrough the second\nquarter of 2026,\nresulting in an\neconomic contraction\nand rising\nunemployment rates. A\n100% weighting to the\nadverse economic\nscenario would have\nresulted in an\napproximate $0.8\nbillion increase in\nour allowance for\ncredit losses as of\nMarch 2025. This\nhypothetical increase\ndoes not take into\nconsideration any\npotential adjustments\nto qualitative\nreserves. The\nforecasts of\nmacroeconomic\nconditions are\ninherently uncertain\nand do not take into\naccount any other\noffsetting or\ncorrelated effects.\nThe actual credit loss\nin an adverse\nmacroeconomic\nenvironment may differ\nsignificantly from\nthis estimate. See\nNote 9 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about the\nallowance for credit\nlosses.\n                                              \n  Use of Estimates                            \n                                              \nU.S. GAAP requires us\nto make certain\nestimates and\nassumptions. In\naddition to the\nestimates we make in\nconnection with fair\nvalue measurements and\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses on loans\nand lending\ncommitments held for\ninvestment and\naccounted for at\namortized cost, the\nuse of estimates and\nassumptions is also\nimportant in\ndetermining\ndiscretionary\ncompensation accruals,\nthe accounting for\ngoodwill and\nidentifiable\nintangible assets,\nprovisions for losses\nthat may arise from\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\n(including\ngovernmental\ninvestigations), and\naccounting for income\ntaxes.\n                                             \n  105    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In addition\nto the level of net\nrevenues net of\nprovision for credit\nlosses, our overall\ncompensation expense\nin any given year is\nalso influenced by,\namong other factors,\noverall financial\nperformance,\nprevailing labor\nmarkets, business mix,\nthe structure of our\nshare-based\ncompensation programs\nand the external\nenvironment.\n\nGoodwill is assessed\nfor impairment\nannually in the fourth\nquarter or more\nfrequently if events\noccur or circumstances\nchange that indicate\nan impairment may\nexist. When assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its carrying\nvalue. If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment. Estimating\nthe fair value of our\nreporting units\nrequires judgment.\nCritical inputs to the\nfair value estimates\ninclude projected\nearnings, allocated\nequity, price-to-\nearnings multiples and\nprice-to-book\nmultiples. There is\ninherent uncertainty\nin the projected\nearnings. The carrying\nvalue of each\nreporting unit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nSee Note 12 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\nannual assessment of\ngoodwill for\nimpairment. If we\nexperience a prolonged\nor severe period of\nweakness in the\nbusiness environment,\nfinancial markets, the\nperformance of one or\nmore of our reporting\nunits or our common\nstock price, or\nadditional increases\nin capital\nrequirements, our\ngoodwill could be\nimpaired in the\nfuture.\n\nIdentifiable\nintangible assets are\ntested for impairment\nwhen events or changes\nin circumstances\nsuggest that an\nasset\u2019s or asset\ngroup\u2019s carrying value\nmay not be fully\nrecoverable. Judgment\nis required to\nevaluate whether\nindications of\npotential impairment\nhave occurred, and to\ntest identifiable\nintangible assets for\nimpairment, if\nrequired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated undiscounted\ncash flows relating to\nthe asset or asset\ngroup is less than the\ncorresponding carrying\nvalue. See Note 12 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about\nidentifiable\nintangible assets.\n\nWe also estimate and\nprovide for potential\nlosses that may arise\nout of litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nto the extent that\nsuch losses are\nprobable and can be\nreasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we\nestimate the upper end\nof the range of\nreasonably possible\naggregate loss in\nexcess of the related\nreserves for\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nwhere we believe the\nrisk of loss is more\nthan slight. See Notes\n18 and 27 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for\ninformation about\ncertain judicial,\nlitigation and\nregulatory\nproceedings.\nSignificant judgment\nis required in making\nthese estimates and\nour final liabilities\nmay ultimately be\nmaterially different.\nOur total estimated\nliability in respect\nof litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nis determined on a\ncase-by-case basis and\nrepresents an estimate\nof probable losses\nafter considering,\namong other factors,\nthe progress of each\ncase, proceeding or\ninvestigation, our\nexperience and the\nexperience of others\nin similar cases,\nproceedings or\ninvestig ations, and\nthe opinions and views\nof legal counsel.\n\nIn accounting for\nincome taxes, we\nrecognize tax\npositions in the\nfinancial statements\nonly when it is more\nlikely than not that\nthe position will be\nsustained on\nexamination by the\nrelevant taxing\nauthority based on the\ntechnical merits of\nthe position. We use\nestimates to recognize\ncurrent and deferred\nincome taxes in the\nU.S. federal, state\nand local and non-U.S.\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate. The income\ntax laws in these\njurisdictions are\ncomplex and can be\nsubject to different\ninterpretations\nbetween taxpayers and\ntaxing authorities.\nDisputes may arise\nover these\ninterpretations and\ncan be settled by\naudit, administrative\nappeals or judicial\nproceedings.

The\nimpact of tax benefits\nrelated to employee\nshare-based awards was\na reduction to\nprovision for taxes\nfor the first quarter\nof 2025 of\napproximately $525\nmillion which reduced\nour effective tax rate\nby 9.4 percentage\npoints, and increased\nour diluted EPS by\n$1.63 and annualized\nROE by 2.0 percentage\npoints.

The\nPillar II legislation\ndid not have a\nmaterial impact on our\neffective tax rate for\nthe first quarter of\n2025. We expect\nadditional guidance or\nlegislation to be\nissued by the OECD and\nvarious jurisdictions\nduring 2025 which\ncould impact any\nminimum tax we owe in\nfuture periods,\npossibly materially,\nand our effective tax\nrate could increase in\n2025 and thereafter.\nThis minimum tax, if\nany, will be\nrecognized in the\nperiod in which it is\nincurred.

In\naddition, we maintain\n(i) market-making\npositions, typically\nfor a short period of\ntime, in response to,\nor in anticipation of,\nclient demand, and\n(ii) positions to\nactively manage our\nrisk exposures that\narise from these\nmarket-making\nactivities\n(collectively,\ninventory). Our\ninventory is recorded\nin trading assets\n(long positions) or\ntrading liabilities\n(short positions) in\nour consolidated\nbalance sheets. Our\nresults are influenced\nby a combination of\ninterconnected\ndrivers, including (i)\nclient activity levels\nand transactional\nbid/offer spreads\n(collectively, client\nactivity), and (ii)\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of our inventory\nand interest income\nand interest expense\nrelated to the\nholding, hedging and\nfunding of our\ninventory\n(collectively, market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges). Due to the\nintegrated nature of\nour market-making\nactivities,\ndisaggregation of net\nrevenues into client\nactivity and market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges is judgmental\nand has inherent\ncomplexities and\nlimitations. The\namount and composition\nof our net revenues\nvary over time as\nthese drivers are\nimpacted by multiple\ninterrelated factors\naffecting economic and\nmarket conditions,\nincluding volatility\nand liquidity in the\nmarket, changes in\ninterest rates,\ncurrency exchange\nrates, credit spreads,\nequity prices and\ncommodity prices,\ninvestor confidence,\nand other\nmacroeconomic concerns\nand uncertainties. In\ngeneral, assuming all\nother market-making\nconditions remain\nconstant, increases in\nclient activity levels\nor bid/offer spreads\ntend to result in\nincreases in net\nrevenues, and\ndecreases tend to have\nthe opposite effect.\nHowever, changes in\nmarket-making\nconditions can\nmaterially impact\nclient activity levels\nand bid/offer spreads,\nas well as the fair\nvalue of our\ninventory.

See\nNote 25 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for net\ninterest income by\nsegment. \u2022 The primary\ndriver of net revenues\nfor FICC\nintermediation for all\nperiods was client\nactivity. \u2022 The\nincrease in net\ninterest income across\nFICC and Equities for\nthe first quarter of\n2025 compared with the\nfirst quarter of 2024\nreflected higher-\nyielding assets and a\ndecrease in funding\ncosts. Due to the\nnature of activities\nwithin FICC and\nEquities and the\ncomposition of their\nassociated balance\nsheet, we assess the\nperformance of these\nbusinesses based on\ntotal net revenues, as\noffsets can occur\nacross revenue line\nitems. For example,\ncash instruments that\ngenerate interest\nincome are, in some\ncases, hedged or\nfunded by derivatives\nfor which changes in\nfair value are\nreflected in market\nmaking revenues. Also,\ncertain activities\nproduce market making\nrevenues but incur\ninterest expense\nrelated to the funding\nof the related\ninventory.

In addition, transaction volumes for\nprior periods may vary from amounts previously\nreported due to the subsequent withdrawal or a\nchange in the value of a transaction.\n\n\u2022 Equity and equity-related offerings includes\nRule 144A and public common stock offerings,\nconvertible offerings and rights offerings. \u2022\nDebt offerings includes non-convertible\npreferred stock, mortgage-backed securities,\nasset-backed securities and taxable municipal\ndebt.

During the first\nquarter of 2025, Global Banking & Markets\noperated in an environment generally\ncharacterized by continued broad macroeconomic\nconcerns and market volatility, including\nconcerns and uncertainty about inflation,\nchanges in international trade policies\n(including the potential for new or increased\ntariffs), geopolitical risks and global\ncentral bank policies. In investment banking,\nindustry-wide completed mergers and\nacquisitions transactions, as well as\nindustry-wide equity underwriting volumes,\ndeclined compared with the fourth quarter of\n2024. Industry-wide debt underwriting volumes\nwere significantly higher compared with the\nfourth quarter of 2024, as activity was strong\nto start the year. In interest rates, the\nyield on 10-year U.S. government bonds\ndecreased, while the yield on 10-year U.K.\ngovernment bonds increased during the quarter.\nIn equities, the S&P 500 Index decreased by 5%\nand the MSCI World Index decreased by 2%, with\nnon-U.S. equities generally higher, compared\nwith the end of 2024. In the future, if market\nand economic conditions deteriorate, and\nmarket-making activity levels decline or\ninvestment banking activity levels continue to\ndecline, or credit spreads related to hedges\non our relationship lending portfolio tighten,\nnet revenues in Global Banking & Markets would\nlikely be negatively impacted. In addition, if\neconomic conditions deteriorate or if the\ncreditworthiness of borrowers deteriorates,\nprovision for credit losses would likely be\nnegatively impacted. Three Months Ended March\n2025 versus March 2024. Net revenues in Global\nBanking & Markets were $10.71 billion for the\nfirst quarter of 2025, 10% higher than the\nfirst quarter of 2024. Investment banking fees\nwere $1.91 billion, 8% lower than the first\nquarter of 2024, primarily due to\nsignificantly lower net revenues in Advisory\ncompared with a strong prior year period,\npartially offset by higher net revenues in\nDebt underwriting, primarily driven by asset-\nbacked and investment-grade activity. Net\nrevenues in Equity underwriting were\nunchanged. As of March 2025, our Investment\nbanking fees backlog increased compared with\nDecember 2024, primarily reflecting higher\nestimated net revenues from potential advisory\ntransactions, partially offset by lower\nestimated net revenues from potential equity\nunderwriting transactions (primarily from\ninitial public offerings).\n                                             \n  113    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During the first\nquarter of 2025, Asset & Wealth Management\noperated in an environment generally\ncharacterized by continued broad macroeconomic\nconcerns and market volatility, including\nconcerns and uncertainty about inflation,\nchanges in international trade policies\n(including the potential for new or increased\ntariffs), geopolitical risk and global central\nbank policies. These factors contributed to a\ndecrease in U.S. equity prices and an increase\ngenerally in non-U.S. equity prices and global\nbond prices compared with the end of 2024. In\nthe future, if market and economic conditions\ndeteriorate, it may lead to a decline in asset\nprices, or investors transitioning to asset\nclasses that typically generate lower fees or\nwithdrawing their assets, and net revenues in\nAsset & Wealth Management would likely be\nnegatively impacted. Three Months Ended March\n2025 versus March 2024. Net revenues in Asset\n& Wealth Management were $3.68 billion for the\nfirst quarter of 2025, 3% lower than the first\nquarter of 2024, reflecting significantly\nlower net revenues in Equity investments and\nDebt investments, partially offset by higher\nManagement and other fees. Net revenues in\nPrivate banking and lending and Incentive fees\nwere also higher. The decrease in Equity\ninvestments net revenues reflected\nsignificantly lower net gains from investments\nin private equities and higher net losses from\ninvestments in public equities. The decrease\nin Debt investments net revenues reflected\nsignificantly lower net interest income due to\na reduction in the debt investments balance\nsheet and net losses compared with net gains\nin the prior year period. The increase in\nManagement and other fees primarily reflected\nthe impact of higher average assets under\nsupervision. The increase in Private banking\nand lending net revenues primarily reflected\nhigher net interest income from lending. The\nincrease in Incentive fees was driven by\nharvesting. Provision for credit losses was\n$19 million for the first quarter of 2025,\ncompared with a net benefit of $22 million for\nthe first quarter of 2024. Operating expenses\nwere $2.87 billion for the first quarter of\n2025, 2% lower than the first quarter of 2024,\ndue to significantly lower CIEs expenses,\nincluding impairments, partially offset by\nhigher transaction based expenses. Pre-tax\nearnings were $788 million for the first\nquarter of 2025, 10% lower than the first\nquarter of 2024.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    116  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The operating\nenvironment for Platform Solutions is mainly\nimpacted by the economic environment in the\nU.S., which, during the first quarter of 2025,\nwas generally characterized by concerns about\ninflation and uncertainty related to changes\nin international trade policies (including the\npotential for new or increased tariffs), a\ncontinued low rate of unemployment and a\ndecline in the pace of growth in consumer\nspending compared with the fourth quarter of\n2024. In the future, if economic conditions\ndeteriorate, it may lead to a further decrease\nin consumer spending or a deterioration in\nconsumer credit, and net revenues and\nprovision for credit losses in Platform\nSolutions would likely be negatively impacted.\nThree Months Ended March 2025 versus March\n2024. Net revenues in Platform Solutions were\n$676 million for the first quarter of 2025, 3%\nlower than the first quarter of 2024.\nTransaction banking and other net revenues\nwere lower, primarily reflecting lower average\ndeposit balances. Notwithstanding our\nstrategic decision to narrow the focus on\nconsumer-related activities, Consumer\nplatforms net revenues were essentially\nunchanged compared with the first quarter of\n2024. See \u201cRegulatory and Other Matters \u2014\nOther Matters \u2014 Narrowing our Focus on\nConsumer-Related Activities\u201d for further\ninformation.\n\nProvision for credit losses was $203 million\nfor the first quarter of 2025, compared with\n$244 million for the first quarter of 2024.\nProvisions for the first quarter of 2025\nreflected net provisions related to the credit\ncard portfolio (driven by net charge-offs,\npartially offset by a reserve release due to a\nseasonal decline in balances). Provisions for\nthe first quarter of 2024 reflected net\nprovisions related to the credit card\nportfolio (driven by net charge-offs).\nOperating expenses were $448 million for the\nfirst quarter of 2025, 22% lower than the\nfirst quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting\nthe impact of the sale of GreenSky. Pre-tax\nearnings were $25 million for the first\nquarter of 2025, compared with a pre-tax loss\nof $117 million for the first quarter of 2024.\nGeographic Data See Note 25 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for a\nsummary of our total net revenues and pre-tax\nearnings by geographic region. Balance Sheet\nand Funding Sources Balance Sheet Management\nOne of our risk management disciplines is our\nability to manage the size and composition of\nour balance sheet. While our asset base\nchanges due to client activity, market\nfluctuations and business opportunities, the\nsize and composition of our balance sheet also\nreflects factors, including (i) our overall\nrisk tolerance, (ii) the amount of capital we\nhold and (iii) our funding profile, among\nother factors. See \u201cCapital Management and\nRegulatory Capital \u2014 Capital Management\u201d for\ninformation about our capital management\nprocess. Although our balance sheet fluctuates\non a day-to-day basis, our total assets at\nquarter-end are generally not materially\ndifferent from those occurring within our\nreporting periods. In order to ensure\nappropriate risk management, we seek to\nmaintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet\nand have processes in place to dynamically\nmanage our assets and liabilities, which\ninclude (i) balance sheet planning, (ii)\nsetting balance sheet targets, (iii)\nmonitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario\nanalyses.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    122  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We prepare a\nbalance sheet plan\nthat combines our\nprojected total assets\nand composition of\nassets with our\nexpected funding\nsources over a three-\nyear time horizon.\nThis plan is reviewed\nquarterly and may be\nadjusted in response\nto changing business\nneeds or market\nconditions. The\nobjectives of this\nplanning process are:\n\n\u2022 To develop our\nbalance sheet\nprojections, taking\ninto account the\ngeneral state of the\nfinancial markets and\nexpected business\nactivity levels, as\nwell as regulatory\nrequirements;\n\n\u2022 To allow Corporate\nTreasury to evaluate\nbalance sheet targets\nof our revenue-\nproducing units and\nrequests to change\nsuch targets in the\ncontext of our overall\nbalance sheet\nconstraints, including\nour liability profile\nand capital levels,\nand key metrics; and\n\n\u2022 To inform the target\namount, tenor and type\nof funding to raise,\nbased on our projected\nassets and contractual\nmaturities.\n\nCorporate Treasury and\nRisk, along with our\nrevenue-producing\nunits, review current\nand prior period\ninformation and\nexpectations for the\nyear to prepare our\nbalance sheet plan.\nThe specific\ninformation reviewed\nincludes asset and\nliability size and\ncomposition, target\nutilization, risk and\nperformance measures,\nand capital usage.\n\nOur consolidated\nbalance sheet plan,\nincluding our balance\nsheets by business,\nfunding projections\nand projected key\nmetrics, is reviewed\nand approved by the\nFirmwide Asset\nLiability Committee.\nSee \u201cRisk Management \u2014\nOverview and Structure\nof Risk Management\u201d\nfor an overview of our\nrisk management\nstructure.\n\nSetting Balance Sheet\nTargets. We set\nbalance sheet targets\nwith the aim of\nensuring that our\nconsolidated balance\nsheet, as well as the\nbalance sheets for our\nbusinesses remain\nwithin our risk\nappetite. The Firmwide\nAsset Liability\nCommittee has the\nresponsibility to\nreview and approve\nbalance sheet targets\nat least quarterly.\nOur balance sheet\ntargets are set at\nlevels which are close\nto actual operating\nlevels, rather than at\nlevels which reflect\nour maximum risk\nappetite, in order to\nensure prompt\nescalation and\ndiscussion among our\nrevenue-producing\nunits, Corporate\nTreasury and Risk.\nRequests for changes\nin targets are\nevaluated after giving\nconsideration to their\nimpact on our key\nmetrics. Compliance\nwith targets is\nmonitored by our\nrevenue-producing\nunits, Corporate\nTreasury and Risk.\n\nMonitoring of Key\nMetrics. We monitor\nkey balance sheet\nmetrics both by\nbusiness and on a\nconsolidated basis,\nincluding asset and\nliability size and\ncomposition, target\nutilization and risk\nmeasures. We attribute\nassets to businesses\nand review and analyze\nmovements resulting\nfrom new business\nactivity, as well as\nmarket fluctuations.\n\nScenario Analyses. We\nconduct various\nscenario analyses,\nincluding as part of\nthe Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR) and U.S.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act Stress\nTests (DFAST), as well\nas our resolution and\nrecovery planning. See\n\u201cCapital Management\nand Regulatory Capital\n\u2014 Capital Management\u201d\nfor further\ninformation about\nthese scenario\nanalyses. These\nscenarios cover short-\nand long-term time\nhorizons using various\nmacroeconomic and\nfirm-specific\nassumptions, based on\na range of economic\nscenarios. We use\nthese analyses to\nassist us in\ndeveloping our longer-\nterm balance sheet\nmanagement strategy,\nincluding the level\nand composition of\nassets, funding and\ncapital. Additionally,\nthese analyses help us\ndevelop approaches for\nmaintaining\nappropriate funding,\nliquidity and capital\nacross a variety of\nsituations, including\na severely stressed\nenvironment.\n                                              \n   Balance Sheet Analysis and Metrics         \n                                              \nAs of March 2025,\ntotal assets in our\nconsolidated balance\nsheets were $1.77\ntrillion, an increase\nof $90.21 billion from\nDecember 2024,\nprimarily reflecting\nincreases in customer\nand other receivables\nof $31.37 billion\n(primarily reflecting\nour clients\u2019\nactivity), trading\nassets of $25.10\nbillion (primarily due\nto increases in\ngovernment\nobligations, equity\nsecurities and\ncorporate debt,\nreflecting the impact\nof our and our\nclients\u2019 activities)\nand collateralized\nagreements of $23.55\nbillion (primarily\nreflecting our and our\nclients\u2019 activities).\n\nAs of March 2025,\ntotal liabilities in\nour consolidated\nbalance sheets were\n$1.64 trillion, an\nincrease of $87.91\nbillion from December\n2024, reflecting\nincreases in deposits\nof $38.12 billion\n(primarily due to\nincreases in other\ndeposits, consumer\ndeposits and brokered\ncertificates of\ndeposit), trading\nliabilities of $30.63\nbillion (primarily\nreflecting increases\nin equity securities\nand government\nobligations, driven by\nour and our clients\u2019\nactivities), customer\nand other payables of\n$30.54 billion\n(primarily reflecting\nour clients\u2019 activity)\nand borrowings of\n$21.53 billion (driven\nby net issuances),\npartially offset by a\ndecrease in\ncollateralized\nfinancings of $28.49\nbillion (reflecting\nthe impact of our and\nour clients\u2019\nactivities).\n                                             \n  123    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We\nfund a significant\namount of inventory\nand a portion of\ninvestments on a\nsecured basis. Secured\nfunding includes\ncollateralized\nfinancings in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets. See Note 11 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about our\ncollateralized\nfinancings, including\nits maturity profile.\nWe may also pledge our\ninventory and\ninvestments as\ncollateral for\nsecurities borrowed\nunder a securities\nlending agreement. We\nalso use our own\ninventory and\ninvestments to cover\ntransactions in which\nwe or our clients have\nsold securities that\nhave not yet been\npurchased. Secured\nfunding is less\nsensitive to changes\nin our credit quality\nthan unsecured\nfunding, due to our\nposting of collateral\nto our lenders.\nNonetheless, we\nanalyze the\nrefinancing risk of\nour secured funding\nactivities, taking\ninto account trade\ntenors, maturity\nprofiles, counterparty\nconcentrations,\ncollateral eligibility\nand counterparty\nrollover\nprobabilities. We seek\nto mitigate our\nrefinancing risk by\nexecuting term trades\nwith staggered\nmaturities,\ndiversifying\ncounterparties,\nraising excess secured\nfunding and pre-\nfunding residual risk\nthrough our GCLA. We\nseek to raise secured\nfunding with a term\nappropriate for the\nliquidity of the\nassets that are being\nfinanced, and we seek\nlonger maturities for\nsecured funding\ncollateralized by\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis,\nespecially during\ntimes of market\nstress. Our secured\nfunding, excluding\nfunding collateralized\nby liquid government\nand agency\nobligations, is\nprimarily executed for\ntenors of one month or\ngreater and is\nprimarily executed\nthrough term\nrepurchase agreements\nand securities loaned\ncontracts. Assets that\nmay be harder to fund\non a secured basis\nduring times of market\nstress include certain\nfinancial instruments\nin the following\ncategories: mortgage-\nand other asset-backed\nloans and securities,\nnon-investment-grade\ncorporate debt\nsecurities, equity\nsecurities and\nemerging market\nsecurities. We also\nraise financing\nthrough other types of\ncollateralized\nfinancings, such as\nsecured loans and\nnotes. GS Bank USA has\naccess to funding from\nthe Federal Home Loan\nBank. Our outstanding\nborrowings from the\nFederal Home Loan Bank\nwere $5.03 billion as\nof March 2025 and\n$5.04 billion as of\nDecember 2024.\nAdditionally, we have\naccess to funding\nthrough the Federal\nReserve discount\nwindow, but we do not\nrely on this funding\nin our liquidity\nplanning and stress\ntesting.\n\nUnsecured Short-Term\nBorrowings. A\nsignificant portion of\nour unsecured short-\nterm borrowings was\noriginally long-term\ndebt that is scheduled\nto mature within one\nyear of the reporting\ndate. We use unsecured\nshort-term borrowings,\nincluding U.S. and\nnon-U.S. hybrid\nfinancial instruments\nand commercial paper,\nto finance liquid\nassets and for other\ncash management\npurposes. In\naccordance with\nregulatory\nrequirements, Group\nInc. does not issue\ndebt with an original\nmaturity of less than\none year, other than\nto its subsidiaries.\nSee Note 14 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\nunsecured short-term\nborrowings. Unsecured\nLong-Term Borrowings.\nUnsecured long-term\nborrowings, including\nstructured notes, are\nraised through\nsyndicated U.S.\nregistered offerings,\nU.S. registered and\nRule 144A medium-term\nnote programs,\noffshore medium-term\nnote offerings and\nother debt offerings.\nWe issue in different\ntenors, currencies and\nproducts to maximize\nthe diversification of\nour investor base.

To\nmitigate refinancing\nrisk, we seek to limit\nthe principal amount\nof debt maturing over\nthe course of any\nmonthly, quarterly,\nsemi-annual or annual\ntime horizon. We enter\ninto interest rate\nswaps to convert a\nportion of our\nunsecured long-term\nborrowings into\nfloating-rate\nobligations to manage\nour exposure to\ninterest rates.

See Notes 14\nand 19 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\nsubordinated debt and\npreferred stock.\n\nCapital Planning and\nStress Testing\nProcess. As part of\ncapital planning, we\nproject sources and\nuses of capital given\na range of business\nenvironments,\nincluding stressed\nconditions. Our stress\ntesting process is\ndesigned to identify\nand measure material\nrisks associated with\nour business\nactivities, including\nmarket risk, credit\nrisk, operational risk\nand liquidity risk, as\nwell as our ability to\ngenerate revenues.\n\nOur capital planning\nprocess incorporates\nan internal capital\nadequacy assessment\nwith the objective of\nensuring that we are\nappropriately\ncapitalized relative\nto the risks in our\nbusinesses. We\nincorporate stress\nscenarios into our\ncapital planning\nprocess with a goal of\nholding sufficient\ncapital to ensure we\nremain adequately\ncapitalized after\nexperiencing a severe\nstress event. Our\nassessment of capital\nadequacy is viewed in\ntandem with our\nassessment of\nliquidity adequacy and\nis integrated into our\noverall risk\nmanagement structure,\ngovernance and policy\nframework.\n\nOur stress tests\nincorporate our\ninternally designed\nstress scenarios,\nincluding our\ninternally developed\nseverely adverse\nscenario, and those\nrequired by the FRB,\nand are designed to\ncapture our specific\nvulnerabilities and\nrisks. We provide\nfurther information\nabout our stress test\nprocesses and a\nsummary of the results\non our website as\ndescribed in\n\u201cAvailable\nInformation.\u201d\n\nAs required by the\nFRB\u2019s CCAR rules, we\nsubmit an annual\ncapital plan for\nreview by the FRB. The\npurpose of the FRB\u2019s\nreview is to ensure\nthat we have a robust,\nforward-looking\ncapital planning\nprocess that accounts\nfor our unique risks\nand that permits\ncontinued operation\nduring times of\neconomic and financial\nstress.\n\nThe FRB evaluates us\nbased, in part, on\nwhether we have the\ncapital necessary to\ncontinue operating\nunder the baseline and\nseverely adverse\nscenarios provided by\nthe FRB and those\ndeveloped internally.\nThis evaluation also\ntakes into account our\nprocess for\nidentifying risk, our\ncontrols and\ngovernance for capital\nplanning, and our\nguidelines for making\ncapital planning\ndecisions. In\naddition, the FRB\nevaluates our plan to\nmake capital\ndistributions (i.e.,\ndividend payments and\nrepurchases or\nredemptions of stock,\nsubordinated debt or\nother capital\nsecurities) and issue\ncapital, across the\nrange of macroeconomic\nscenarios and firm-\nspecific assumptions.\nThe FRB determines the\nstress capital buffer\n(SCB) applicable to us\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\nThe SCB under the\nStandardized approach\nis calculated as (i)\nthe difference between\nour starting and\nminimum projected CET1\ncapital ratios under\nthe supe rvisory\nseverely adverse\nscenario and (ii) our\nplanned common stock\ndividends for each of\nthe fourth through\nseventh quarters of\nthe planning horizon,\nexpressed as a\npercentage of RWAs.\n\nBased on our 2024 CCAR\nsubmission, the FRB\nincreased our SCB from\n5.5% to 6.2%,\nresulting in a\nStandardized CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement of 13.7%\nfor the period from\nOctober 1, 2024\nthrough September 30,\n2025.

This\nframework considers\nmany factors,\nincluding our internal\nassessment of risks as\nwell as the regulatory\ncapital requirements\nrelated to our\nbusiness activities.\n\nWe review and make any\nnecessary adjustments\nto our attributed\nequity in January each\nyear, to reflect,\namong other things,\nour most recent stress\ntest results and\nchanges to our\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. On\nJanuary 1, 2025, our\nallocation of\nattributed equity\nchanged (relative to\nthe allocation as of\nDecember 2024) as\nfollows: attributed\nequity increased by\napproximately $0.4\nbillion for Global\nBanking & Markets,\nwhile attributed\nequity decreased by\napproximately $0.3\nbillion for Asset &\nWealth Management and\napproximately $0.1\nbillion for Platform\nSolutions. See\n\u201cResults of Operations\n\u2014 Segment Assets and\nOperating Results \u2014\nSegment Operating\nResults\u201d for\ninformation about our\naverage quarterly\nattributed equity by\nsegment.\n\nShare Repurchase\nProgram. We use our\nshare repurchase\nprogram to help\nmaintain the\nappropriate level of\ncommon equity. On an\nannual basis, we\nsubmit a Board of\nDirectors of Group\nInc. (Board) approved\ncapital plan to the\nFederal Reserve, which\nincludes planned share\nrepurchases for each\nquarter. The share\nrepurchases are\neffected primarily\nthrough regular open-\nmarket purchases\n(which may include\nrepurchase plans\ndesigned to comply\nwith Rule 10b5-1 and\naccelerated share\nrepurchases), the\namounts and timing of\nwhich are determined\nprimarily by our\ncurrent and projected\ncapital position, and\ncapital deployment\nopportunities, but\nwhich may also be\ninfluenced by general\nmarket conditions and\nthe prevailing price\nand trading volumes of\nour common stock.\n\nDuring the first\nquarter of 2025, the\nBoard approved a share\nrepurchase program\nauthorizing\nrepurchases of up to\n$40 billion of our\ncommon stock. The\nprogram has no set\nexpiration or\ntermination date. See\n\u201cUnregistered Sales of\nEquity Securities and\nUse of Proceeds\u201d in\nPart II, Item 2 of\nthis Form 10-Q and\nNote 19 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\nshare repurchase\nprogram, and see above\nfor information about\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess.\n\nDuring the first\nquarter of 2025, we\nreturned a total of\n$5.34 billion of\ncapital to common\nshareholders,\nincluding $4.36\nbillion of common\nshare repurchases and\n$976 million of common\nstock dividends.\nConsistent with our\ncapital management\nphilosophy, we will\ncontinue prioritizing\ndeployment of capital\nfor our clients where\nreturns are attractive\nand distribute any\nexcess capital to\nshareholders through\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, while\ntargeting a 50 to 100\nbasis point buffer\nabove our capital\nrequirement.\n\nWe are subject to a\none percent non-\ndeductible federal\nexcise tax (buyback\ntax) that is\napplicable to the fair\nmarket value of\ncertain corporate\nshare repurchases. The\nfair market value of\nshare repurchases\nsubject to the tax is\nreduced by the fair\nmarket value of any\napplicable stock\nissued during the\ncalendar year,\nincluding stock issued\nto employees. The\nbuyback tax did not\nhave a material impact\non our financial\ncondition, results of\noperations or cash\nflows for the three\nmonths ended March\n2025.\n\nResolution Capital\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established a\nResolution Capital\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich is designed to\nensure that our major\nsubsidiaries (GS Bank\nUSA, Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI,\nGSIB, GSBE, Goldman\nSachs Japan Co., Ltd.\n(GSJCL), Goldman Sachs\nAsset Management, L.P.\nand Goldman Sachs\nAsset Management\nInternational) have\naccess to sufficient\nloss-absorbing\ncapacity (in the form\nof equity,\nsubordinated debt and\nunsecured senior debt)\nso that they are able\nto wind down following\na Group Inc.\nbankruptcy filing in\naccordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIn addition, we have\nestablished a triggers\nand alerts framework,\nwhich is designed to\nprovide the Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    128  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

GS Bank USA,\nGSIB and GSBE have\nalso been assigned\nlong- and short-term\nissuer ratings, as\nwell as ratings on\ntheir long- and short-\nterm bank deposits. In\naddition, credit\nrating agencies have\nassigned ratings to\ndebt obligations of\ncertain other\nsubsidiaries of Group\nInc. The level and\ncomposition of our\ncapital are among the\nmany factors\nconsidered in\ndetermining our credit\nratings. Each agency\nhas its own definition\nof eligible capital\nand methodology for\nevaluating capital\nadequacy, and\nassessments are\ngenerally based on a\ncombination of factors\nrather than a single\ncalculation.

The capital\nrequirements\ncalculated under the\nCapital Framework\ninclude the capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements, which\nare comprised of a\n2.5% buffer (under the\nAdvanced Capital\nRules), the SCB (under\nthe Standardized\nCapital Rules), a\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer (under\nboth Capital Rules)\nand the G-SIB\nsurcharge (under both\nCapital Rules). Our\nG-SIB surcharge is\n3.0% for 2025 and will\nbe 3.5% beginning in\n2026. Based on\nfinancial data for the\nthree months ended\nMarch 2025, we are in\nthe 4.0% G-SIB\nsurcharge threshold\nrange. The earliest\nthis surcharge could\nbe effective is\nJanuary 2028. The\nG-SIB surcharge and\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer in the\nfuture may differ due\nto additional guidance\nfrom our regulators\nand/or positional\nchanges, and our SCB\ncan change\nsignificantly from\nyear to year based on\nthe results of the\nannual supervisory\nstress tests. Our\ntarget is to maintain\ncapital ratios equal\nto the regulatory\nrequirements plus a\nbuffer of 50 to 100\nbasis points. See Note\n20 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about our\nrisk-based capital\nratios and leverage\nratios, and the\nCapital Framework.\n\nTotal Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity (TLAC) We are\nalso subject to the\nFRB\u2019s TLAC and related\nrequirements. Failure\nto comply with the\nTLAC and related\nrequirements would\nresult in restrictions\nbeing imposed by the\nFRB and could limit\nour ability to\nrepurchase shares, pay\ndividends and make\ncertain discretionary\ncompensation payments.\nThe table below\npresents TLAC and\nexternal long-term\ndebt requirements.\n                                              \n              As of                           \n                     March          December  \n                      2025              2024  \n  TLAC to      22.0      %    22.0         %  \n  RWAs                                        \n  TLAC to                                     \n  leverage      9.5      %     9.5         %  \n  exposure                                    \n  External                                    \n  long-te\u2026      9.0      %     9.0         %  \n  debt to                                     \n  RWAs                                        \n  External                                    \n  long-te\u2026                                    \n  debt to       4.5      %     4.5         %  \n  leverage                                    \n  exposure                                    \n                                              \nIn the table above: \u2022\nThe TLAC to RWAs\nrequirement included\n(i) the 18% minimum,\n(ii) the 2.5% buffer,\n(iii) the\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer, which\nthe FRB has set to\nzero percent and (iv)\nthe 1.5% G-SIB\nsurcharge (Method 1).\n\u2022 The TLAC to leverage\nexposure requirement\nincludes (i) the 7.5%\nminimum and (ii) the\n2.0% leverage exposure\nbuffer. \u2022 The external\nlong-term debt to RWAs\nrequirement includes\n(i) the 6% minimum and\n(ii) the 3.0% G-SIB\nsurcharge (Method 2).\n\u2022 The external long-\nterm debt to total\nleverage exposure is\nthe 4.5% minimum.

The transition is expected\nto be completed in the third quarter of 2025.\n\u2022 During 2024, we sold our seller financing\nloan portfolio (included within Platform\nSolutions). This portfolio consisted of loans\nthat were extended to small- and medium-sized\nretailers. We remain committed to supporting\nthe products and servicing customers through\nthe various transition arrangements for our\nconsumer-related activities.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    132  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Our risk\nmanagement structure\nis built around three\ncore components:\ngovernance, processes\nand people.\n\nGovernance. Risk\nmanagement governance\nstarts with the Board,\nwhich both directly\nand through its\ncommittees, including\nits Risk Committee,\noversees our approach\nto managing our risks\nthrough the enterprise\nrisk management\nframework. The Board\nis also responsible\nfor the annual review\nand approval of our\nrisk appetite\nstatement. The risk\nappetite statement\ndescribes the levels\nand types of risk we\nare willing to accept\nor to avoid in order\nto achieve our\nobjectives included in\nour strategy and\nbusiness plan, while\nremaining in\ncompliance with\nregulatory\nrequirements. The\nBoard reviews our\nstrategy and business\nplan and is ultimately\nresponsible for\noverseeing and\nproviding direction\nabout our strategy and\nrisk appetite.\n\nThe Board, including\nthrough its\ncommittees, receives\nregular briefings on\nfirmwide risks,\nincluding liquidity\nrisk, market risk,\ncredit risk,\noperational risk,\nmodel risk and climate\nrisk, from our chief\nrisk officer, on\ncybersecurity threats\nand risks from our\nchief information\nsecurity officer\n(CISO), on compliance\nrisk and conduct risk\nfrom our chief\ncompliance officer, on\nlegal and regulatory\nenforcement matters\nfrom our chief legal\nofficer, and on other\nmatters impacting our\nreputation from the\nchair and/or vice-\nchairs of our Firmwide\nReputational Risk\nCommittee. The chief\nrisk officer reports\nto our chief executive\nofficer and to the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard. As part of the\nreview of the firmwide\nrisk portfolio, the\nchief risk officer\nregularly advises the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard of relevant risk\nmetrics and material\nexposures, including\nrisk limits and\nthresholds established\nin our risk appetite\nstatement.\n\nEnterprise Risk, which\nreports to our chief\nrisk officer, is\nresponsible for\nensuring that our\nenterprise risk\nmanagement framework\nprovides the Board,\nour risk committees\nand senior management\nwith a consistent and\nintegrated approach to\nmanaging our various\nrisks in a manner\nconsistent with our\nrisk appetite.\n\nOur first line of\ndefense consists of\nour revenue-producing\nunits, Conflicts\nResolution,\nControllers,\nEngineering, Corporate\nTreasury and certain\nother corporate\nfunctions. The first\nline of defense is\nresponsible for its\nrisk-generating\nactivities, as well as\nfor the design and\nexecution of controls\nto mitigate such\nrisks.\n\nOur Risk and\nCompliance functions\nare considered our\nsecond line of defense\nand provide\nindependent\nassessment, oversight\nand challenge of the\nrisks taken by our\nfirst line of defense,\nas well as lead and\nparticipate in\nfirmwide risk\ncommittees.\n\nInternal Audit is\nconsidered our third\nline of defense, and\nour director of\nInternal Audit reports\nto the Audit Committee\nof the Board and\nadministratively to\nour chief executive\nofficer. Internal\nAudit includes\nprofessionals with a\nbroad range of audit\nand industry\nexperience, including\nrisk management\nexpertise. Internal\nAudit is responsible\nfor independently\nassessing and\nvalidating the\neffectiveness of key\ncontrols, including\nthose within the risk\nmanagement framework,\nand providing timely\nreporting to the Audit\nCommittee of the\nBoard, senior\nmanagement and\nregulators.\n\nThe three lines of\ndefense structure\npromotes the\naccountability of\nfirst line risk\ntakers, provides a\nframework for\neffective challenge by\nthe second line and\nempowers independent\nreview from the third\nline.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    134  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nProcesses. We maintain\nvarious processes that\nare critical\ncomponents of our risk\nmanagement framework,\nincluding (i) risk\nidentification and\nassessment, (ii) risk\nappetite, limits,\nthresholds and alerts,\n(iii) control\nmonitoring and\ntesting, and (iv) risk\nreporting.\n\n\u2022 Risk Identification\nand Assessment. We\nbelieve the\nidentification and\nassessment of our\nrisks is a critical\nstep in providing our\nBoard and senior\nmanagement\ntransparency and\ninsight into the range\nand materiality of our\nrisks. We have a\ncomprehensive data\ncollection process,\nincluding firmwide\npolicies and\nprocedures that\nrequire all employees\nto report and escalate\nrisk events. Our\napproach for risk\nidentification and\nassessment is\ncomprehensive across\nall risk types, is\ndynamic and forward-\nlooking to reflect and\nadapt to our changing\nrisk profile and\nbusiness environment,\nleverages subject\nmatter expertise, and\nallows for\nprioritization of our\nmost critical risks.\nWe perform risk\nassessments\nperiodically with the\naim of ensuring that\nour material financial\nand nonfinancial risks\nare mitigated through\ncontrols to an\nacceptable tolerance\nlevel in accordance\nwith our risk\nappetite. Our risk\nassessments include,\namong other things,\nthe use of stress\ntesting as well as an\nassessment of our\ninternal control\nprocesses designed to\nmitigate such risks.\n\nFirmwide stress\ntesting is an\nimportant part of our\nrisk management\nprocess. It allows us\nto quantify our\nexposure to tail\nrisks, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations,\nundertake risk/reward\nanalysis, and assess\nand mitigate our risk\npositions. Firmwide\nstress tests are\nperformed on a regular\nbasis and are designed\nto ensure a\ncomprehensive analysis\nof our vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic\nrisks combining\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, credit,\nmarket, liquidity and\nfunding, operational\nand compliance,\nstrategic, systemic\nand emerging risks\ninto our stress\nscenarios. We also\nperform ad hoc stress\ntests in anticipation\nof market events or\nconditions. Stress\ntests are also used to\nassess capital\nadequacy as part of\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess. See \u201cCapital\nManagement and\nRegulatory Capital \u2014\nCapital Management\u201d\nfor further\ninformation.\n\nWe maintain a daily\ndiscipline of marking\nsubstantially all of\nour inventory to\ncurrent market levels.\nWe carry our inventory\nat fair value, with\nchanges in valuation\nreflected immediately\nin our risk management\nsystems and in net\nrevenues. We do so\nbecause we believe\nthis discipline is one\nof the most effective\ntools for assessing\nand managing risk and\nthat it provides\ntransparent and\nrealistic insight into\nour inventory\nexposures.\n\n\u2022 Risk Appetite,\nLimits, Thresholds and\nAlerts. We apply risk\nlimits, thresholds and\nalerts to control and\nmonitor risk across\ntransactions,\nproducts, businesses\nand markets. The\nBoard, directly or\nindirectly through its\nRisk Committee,\napproves limits,\nthresholds and alerts\nincluded in our risk\nappetite statement at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels. In\naddition, the Firmwide\nRisk Appetite\nCommittee, through\ndelegated authority\nfrom the Firmwide\nEnterprise Risk\nCommittee, is\nresponsible for\napproving our risk\nlimits, thresholds and\nalerts policy, subject\nto the overall limits\ndirectly or indirectly\napproved by the Board,\nand monitoring these\nlimits.\n\nThe Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee is\nresponsible for\napproving and\nmonitoring limits at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels.\nCertain limits may be\nset at levels that\nwill require periodic\nadjustment, rather\nthan at levels that\nreflect our maximum\nrisk appetite. This\nfosters an ongoing\ndialogue about risk\namong our first and\nsecond lines of\ndefense, committees\nand senior management,\nas well as rapid\nescalation of risk-\nrelated matters. The\nFirmwide Risk Appetite\nCommittee also\nauthorizes Risk to set\nlimits and thresholds\nto support monitoring\nand oversight at a\nmore granular level.\nFor example, Market\nRisk sets limits at\ncertain product and\ndesk levels, and\nCredit Risk sets\nlimits for individual\ncounterparties and\ntheir subsidiaries,\nindustries and\ncountries. Limits are\nreviewed regularly and\namended on a permanent\nor temporary basis to\nreflect changes to our\nstrategic business\nplan, as well as\nchanging market\nconditions, business\nconditions or risk\ntolerance. Risks\nlimits are monitored\nby the respective Risk\nfunctions.\n                                             \n  135    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \n\u2022 Control Monitoring\nand Testing. We\nperform control\nmonitoring and testing\nto measure the\neffectiveness of our\nkey controls and to\nensure that we are in\ncompliance with\npolicies, codes of\nconduct, control\nstandards and\nregulatory\nrequirements.\nMonitoring and testing\nis performed by\ndedicated teams within\nthe first and second\nlines of defense.\nThese teams establish\nprocedures, develop\nrisk-based annual\nplans, perform control\ntesting and escalate\nidentified issues.\n\nIssues identified by\nthe dedicated teams,\nas well as self-\nidentified issues by\nour employees, are\nassessed for\nappropriate escalation\nand resolution. Where\nmaterial or thematic\nissues exist, we\ndevelop a plan to\nremediate them, as\nappropriate, and\nmonitor the\nremediation\nactivities.\n\n\u2022 Risk Reporting.\nEffective risk\nreporting depends on\nour ability to get the\nright information to\nthe right people at\nthe right time. Risk\nreporting is designed\nto be both forward-\nand backward-looking\nand consider detailed\ninformation on\nexisting and emerging\nrisk exposures. Risk\nreporting may include\nstress testing and\nscenario analysis,\ninformation about the\nrisk profiles for\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nutilization of risk\nlimits and thresholds,\ndetails of new and\nemerging risks\nidentified through our\nrisk identification\nprocesses, details of\nissues, significant\ninternal and external\nevents, and\ninformation related to\nthe effectiveness of\nour controls and\nremediation plans. As\nsuch, we focus on the\nrigor and\neffectiveness of our\nrisk systems, with the\nobjective of ensuring\nthat our risk\nmanagement technology\nsystems provide us\nwith complete,\naccurate and timely\ninformation. Our risk\nreporting process is\ndesigned to take into\naccount information\nabout both existing\nand emerging risks,\nthereby enabling our\nrisk committees and\nsenior management to\nperform their\nresponsibilities with\nthe appropriate level\nof insight into risk\nexposures.\n\nWe make extensive use\nof risk committees and\ncouncils that meet\nregularly and serve as\nan important means to\nfacilitate and foster\nongoing discussions to\nmanage and mitigate\nrisks.\n\nWe maintain strong and\nproactive\ncommunication about\nrisk and we have a\nculture of\ncollaboration in\ndecision-making among\nour first and second\nlines of defense,\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement. While our\nfirst line of defense\nis accountable and\nresponsible for\nmanagement of their\nrisk, we dedicate\nextensive resources to\nour second line of\ndefense in order to\nreinforce the\nimportance of having\neffective oversight\nand challenge, and a\nstrong culture of\nescalation and\naccountability across\nall functions.\n\nPeople. Even the best\ntechnology serves only\nas a tool for helping\nto make informed\ndecisions in real time\nabout the risks we are\ntaking. Ultimately,\neffective risk\nmanagement requires\nour people to\ninterpret our risk\ndata on an ongoing and\ntimely basis and\nadjust risk positions\naccordingly. The\nexperience of our\nprofessionals, and\ntheir understanding of\nthe nuances and\nlimitations of each\nrisk measure, guides\nus in assessing\nexposures and\nmaintaining them\nwithin prudent levels.\n\nWe reinforce a culture\nof effective risk\nmanagement, consistent\nwith our risk\nappetite, in our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nas well as in the way\nwe evaluate\nperformance, and\nrecognize and reward\nour people. Our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nincluding certain\nsessions led by our\nmost senior leaders,\nare focused on the\nimportance of risk\nmanagement, client\nrelationships and\nreputational\nexcellence. As part of\nour performance review\nprocess, we assess\nreputational\nexcellence, including\nhow an employee\nexercises good risk\nmanagement and\nreputational judgment,\nand adheres to our\ncode of conduct and\ncompliance policies.\nOur review and reward\nprocesses are designed\nto communicate and\nreinforce to our\nprofessionals the link\nbetween behavior and\nhow people are\nrecognized, the need\nto focus on our\nclients and our\nreputation, and the\nneed to always act in\naccordance with our\nhighest standards.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    136  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The Board\noversees risk both\ndirectly and through\nits committees,\nincluding its Risk\nCommittee. We also\nhave a series of\ncommittees that\ngenerally consist of\nsenior managers,\nincluding from both\nour first and second\nlines of defense, with\nspecific risk\nmanagement mandates\nthat have oversight or\ndecision-making\nresponsibilities for\nrisk management\nactivities. We have an\nestablished policy for\nthese committees so\nthat appropriate\ninformation barriers\nare in place. Our\nprimary risk\ncommittees, most of\nwhich also have\nadditional sub-\ncommittees, councils\nor working groups, are\ndescribed below. In\naddition to these\ncommittees, we have\nother risk committees\nthat provide oversight\nfor different\nbusinesses,\nactivities, products,\nregions and entities.\nAll of our committees\nhave responsibility\nfor considering the\nimpact on our\nreputation of the\ntransactions and\nactivities that they\noversee.\n\nMembership of our risk\ncommittees is reviewed\nregularly and updated\nto reflect changes in\nthe responsibilities\nof the committee\nmembers. Accordingly,\nthe length of time\nthat members serve on\nthe respective\ncommittees varies as\ndetermined by the\ncommittee chairs and\nbased on the\nresponsibilities of\nthe members.\n\nThe chart below\npresents an overview\nof our risk management\ngovernance structure.\n\nManagement Committee.\nThe Management\nCommittee oversees our\nglobal activities. It\nprovides this\noversight directly and\nthrough delegated\nauthority. This\ncommittee consists of\nour most senior\nleaders, and is\nchaired by our chief\nexecutive officer.\nMost members of the\nManagement Committee\nare also members of\nother committees. The\nfollowing are the\ncommittees that are\nprincipally involved\nin firmwide risk\nmanagement.\n\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee. The\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee is\nresponsible for\noverseeing all of our\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks. As\npart of such\noversight, the\ncommittee is\nresponsible for the\nongoing review,\napproval and\nmonitoring of our\nenterprise risk\nmanagement framework,\nas well as our risk\nlimits, and thresholds\nand alerts policy,\nthrough delegated\nauthority to the\nFirmwide Risk Appetite\nCommittee. The\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee also\nreviews new\nsignificant strategic\nbusiness initiatives\nto determine whether\nthey are consistent\nwith our risk appetite\nand risk management\ncapabilities.\nAdditionally, the\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee\nperforms enhanced\nreviews of significant\nrisk events, the top\nresidual and emerging\nrisks, and the overall\nrisk and control\nenvironment in each of\nour business units in\norder to propose\nuplifts, identify\nelements that are\ncommon to all business\nunits and analyze the\nconsolidated residual\nrisks that we face.\nThis committee, which\nreports to the\nManagement Committee,\nis co-chaired by our\npresident and chief\noperating officer and\nour chief risk\nofficer, who are\nappointed as chairs by\nour chief executive\nofficer, and the vice-\nchair is our chief\nfinancial officer, who\nis appointed as vice-\nchair by the chairs of\nthe Firmwide\nEnterprise Risk\nCommittee.

GCLA is\nliquidity that we\nmaintain to meet a\nbroad range of\npotential cash\noutflows and\ncollateral needs in a\nstressed environment.\nA primary liquidity\nprinciple is to pre-\nfund our estimated\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs\nduring a liquidity\ncrisis and hold this\nliquidity in the form\nof unencumbered,\nhighly liquid\nsecurities and cash.\nWe believe that the\nsecurities held in our\nGCLA would be readily\nconvertible to cash in\na matter of days,\nthrough liquidation,\nby entering into\nrepurchase agreements\nor from maturities of\nresale agreements, and\nthat this cash would\nallow us to meet\nimmediate obligations\nwithout needing to\nsell other assets or\ndepend on additional\nfunding from credit-\nsensitive markets.\n\nOur GCLA reflects the\nfollowing principles:\n\n\u2022 The first days or\nweeks of a liquidity\ncrisis are the most\ncritical to a\ncompany\u2019s survival;\n\n\u2022 Focus must be\nmaintained on all\npotential cash and\ncollateral outflows,\nnot just disruptions\nto financing flows.\nOur businesses are\ndiverse, and our\nliquidity needs are\ndetermined by many\nfactors, including\nmarket movements,\ncollateral\nrequirements and\nclient commitments,\nall of which can\nchange dramatically in\na difficult funding\nenvironment;\n\n\u2022 During a liquidity\ncrisis, credit-\nsensitive funding,\nincluding unsecured\ndebt, certain deposits\nand some types of\nsecured financing\nagreements, may be\nunavailable, and the\nterms (e.g., interest\nrates, collateral\nprovisions and tenor)\nor availability of\nother types of secured\nfinancing may change\nand certain deposits\nmay be withdrawn; and\n\n\u2022 As a result of our\npolicy to pre-fund\nliquidity that we\nestimate may be needed\nin a crisis, we hold\nmore unencumbered\nsecurities and have\nlarger funding\nbalances than our\nbusinesses would\notherwise require. We\nbelieve that our\nliquidity is stronger\nwith greater balances\nof highly liquid\nunencumbered\nsecurities, even\nthough it increases\nour total assets and\nour funding costs.\n\nWe maintain our GCLA\nacross Group Inc.,\nGoldman Sachs Funding\nLLC (Funding IHC) and\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries, asset\ntypes and clearing\nagents with the goal\nof providing us with\nsufficient operating\nliquidity to ensure\ntimely settlement in\nall major markets,\neven in a difficult\nfunding environment.\nIn addition to the\nGCLA, we maintain cash\nbalances and\nsecurities in several\nof our other entities,\nprimarily for use in\nspecific currencies,\nentities or\njurisdictions where we\ndo not have immediate\naccess to parent\ncompany liquidity.\n\nAsset-Liability\nManagement. Our\nliquidity risk\nmanagement policies\nare designed to ensure\nwe have a sufficient\namount of financing,\neven when funding\nmarkets experience\npersistent stress. We\nmanage the maturities\nand diversity of our\nfunding across\nmarkets, products and\ncounterparties, and\nseek to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nOur approach to asset-\nliability management\nincludes:\n\n\u2022 Conservatively\nmanaging the overall\ncharacteristics of our\nfunding book, with a\nfocus on maintaining\nlong-term, diversified\nsources of funding in\nexcess of our current\nrequirements. See\n\u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nFunding Sources\u201d for\nfurther information;\n\n\u2022 Actively managing\nand monitoring our\nasset base, with\nparticular focus on\nthe liquidity, holding\nperiod and ability to\nfund assets on a\nsecured basis. We\nassess our funding\nrequirements and our\nability to liquidate\nassets in a stressed\nenvironment while\nappropriately managing\nrisk. This enables us\nto determine the most\nappropriate funding\nproducts and tenors.\nSee \u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nBalance Sheet\nManagement\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our balance\nsheet management\nprocess and \u201c\u2014 Funding\nSources \u2014 Secured\nFunding\u201d for further\ninformation about\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis; and\n\n\u2022 Raising secured and\nunsecured financing\nthat has a long tenor\nrelative to the\nliquidity profile of\nour assets. This\nreduces the risk that\nour liabilities will\ncome due in advance of\nour ability to\ngenerate liquidity\nfrom the sale of our\nassets. Because we\nmaintain a highly\nliquid balance sheet,\nthe holding period of\ncertain of our assets\nmay be materially\nshorter than their\ncontractual maturity\ndates.\n\nOur goal is to ensure\nthat we maintain\nsufficient liquidity\nto fund our assets and\nmeet our contractual\nand contingent\nobligations in normal\ntimes, as well as\nduring periods of\nmarket stress. Through\nour dynamic balance\nsheet management\nprocess, we use actual\nand projected asset\nbalances to determine\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding requirements.\nFunding plans are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee.\nIn addition, Risk and\nthe Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee\nreview our total\nunsecured long-term\nborrowings and total\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nto help ensure that we\nmaintain a level of\nlong-term funding that\nis sufficient to meet\nour long-term\nfinancing\nrequirements. In a\nliquidity crisis, we\nwould begin by\nliquidating and\nmonetizing our GCLA\nbefore selling other\nassets. However, we\nrecognize that orderly\nasset sales may be\nprudent or necessary\nin a severe or\npersistent liquidity\ncrisis.\n                                             \n  139    Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In\naddition, Group Inc.\nprovides its regulated\nsubsidiaries with the\nnecessary capital to\nmeet their regulatory\nrequirements. The\nbenefits of this\napproach to subsidiary\nfunding are enhanced\ncontrol and greater\nflexibility to meet\nthe funding\nrequirements of our\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nis also raised at the\nsubsidiary level\nthrough a variety of\nproducts, including\ndeposits, secured\nfunding and unsecured\nborrowings.\n\nOur intercompany\nfunding policies\nassume that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s funds or\nsecurities are not\nfreely available to\nits parent, Funding\nIHC or other\nsubsidiaries unless\n(i) legally provided\nfor and (ii) there are\nno additional\nregulatory, tax or\nother restrictions. In\nparticular, many of\nour subsidiaries are\nsubject to laws that\nauthorize regulatory\nbodies to block or\nreduce the flow of\nfunds from those\nsubsidiaries to Group\nInc. or Funding IHC.\nRegulatory action of\nthat kind could impede\naccess to funds that\nGroup Inc. needs to\nmake payments on its\nobligations.\nAccordingly, we assume\nthat the capital\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or other\nsubsidiaries and any\nother financing\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or Funding\nIHC until the maturity\nof such financing.\n\nGroup Inc. has\nprovided substantial\namounts of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness, directly\nor indirectly, to its\nregulated\nsubsidiaries. For\nexample, as of March\n2025, Group Inc. had\n$38.90 billion of\nequity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness invested\nin GS&Co., its\nprincipal U.S.\nregistered broker-\ndealer; $48.44 billion\ninvested in GSI, a\nregulated U.K. broker-\ndealer; $2.27 billion\ninvested in GSJCL, a\nregulated Japanese\nbroker-dealer; $65.60\nbillion invested in GS\nBank USA, a regulated\nNew York State-\nchartered bank; and\n$5.45 billion invested\nin GSIB, a regulated\nU.K. bank. Group Inc.\nalso provides\nfinancing, directly or\nindirectly, in the\nform of: $149.40\nbillion of\nunsubordinated loans\n(including secured\nloans of $52.75\nbillion) and $30.64\nbillion of collateral\nand cash deposits to\nthese entities as of\nMarch 2025. In\naddition, as of March\n2025, Group Inc. had\nsignificant amounts of\ncapital invested in\nand loans to its other\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nContingency Funding\nPlan. We maintain a\ncontingency funding\nplan to provide a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nliquidity crisis\nsituation or periods\nof market stress. Our\ncontingency funding\nplan outlines a list\nof potential risk\nfactors, key reports\nand metrics that are\nreviewed on an ongoing\nbasis to assist in\nassessing the severity\nof, and managing\nthrough, a liquidity\ncrisis and/or market\ndislocation. The\ncontingency funding\nplan also describes in\ndetail our potential\nresponses if our\nassessments indicate\nthat we have entered a\nliquidity crisis,\nwhich include pre-\nfunding for what we\nestimate will be our\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs, as\nwell as utilizing\nsecondary sources of\nliquidity. Mitigants\nand action items to\naddress specific risks\nwhich may arise are\nalso described and\nassigned to\nindividuals\nresponsible for\nexecution.\n\nThe contingency\nfunding plan\nidentifies key groups\nof individuals and\ntheir\nresponsibilities,\nwhich include\nfostering effective\ncoordination, control\nand distribution of\ninformation,\nimplementing liquidity\nmaintenance activities\nand managing internal\nand external\ncommunication, all of\nwhich are critical in\nthe management of a\ncrisis or period of\nmarket stress.\nStress Tests\nIn order to determine\nthe appropriate size\nof our GCLA, we model\nliquidity outflows\nover a range of\nscenarios and time\nhorizons. One of our\nprimary internal\nliquidity risk models,\nreferred to as the\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow, quantifies\nour liquidity risks\nover a 30-day stress\nscenario. We also\nconsider other\nfactors, including,\nbut not limited to, an\nassessment of our\npotential intraday\nliquidity needs\nthrough an additional\ninternal liquidity\nrisk model, referred\nto as the Intraday\nLiquidity Model, the\nresults of our long-\nterm stress testing\nmodels, our resolution\nliquidity models and\nother applicable\nregulatory\nrequirements and a\nqualitative assessment\nof our condition, as\nwell as the financial\nmarkets. The results\nof the Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow, the\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel, the long-term\nstress testing models\nand the resolution\nliquidity models are\nreported to senior\nmanagement on a\nregular basis.

Our Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow is\nbased on conducting\nmultiple scenarios\nthat include\ncombinations of\nmarket-wide and firm-\nspecific stress. These\nscenarios are\ncharacterized by the\nfollowing qualitative\nelements:\n\n\u2022 Severely challenged\nmarket environments,\nwhich include low\nconsumer and corporate\nconfidence, financial\nand political\ninstability, and\nadverse changes in\nmarket values,\nincluding potential\ndeclines in equity\nmarkets and widening\nof credit spreads; and\n\n\u2022 A firm-specific\ncrisis potentially\ntriggered by material\nlosses, reputational\ndamage (including, as\na result of, the\ndissemination of\nnegative information\nthrough social media),\nlitigation and/or a\nratings downgrade.\n\nThe following are key\nmodeling elements of\nour Modeled Liquidity\nOutflow:\n\n\u2022 Liquidity needs over\na 30-day scenario;\n\n\u2022 A two-notch\ndowngrade of our long-\nterm senior unsecured\ncredit ratings;\n\n\u2022 Changing conditions\nin funding markets,\nwhich limit our access\nto unsecured and\nsecured funding;\n\n\u2022 No support from\nadditional government\nfunding facilities.\nAlthough we have\naccess to various\ncentral bank funding\nprograms, we do not\nassume reliance on\nadditional sources of\nfunding in a liquidity\ncrisis; and\n\n\u2022 A combination of\ncontractual outflows\nand contingent\noutflows arising from\nboth our on- and off-\nbalance sheet\narrangements.\nContractual outflows\ninclude, among other\nthings, upcoming\nmaturities of\nunsecured debt, term\ndeposits and secured\nfunding. Contingent\noutflows include,\namong other things,\nthe withdrawal of\ncustomer credit\nbalances in our prime\nbrokerage business,\nincrease in variation\nmargin requirements\ndue to adverse changes\nin the value of our\nexchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared\nderivatives, draws on\nunfunded commitments\nand withdrawals of\ndeposits that have no\ncontractual maturity.\nSee notes to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\ncontractual outflows,\nincluding Note 11 for\ncollateralized\nfinancings, Note 13\nfor deposits, Note 14\nfor unsecured long-\nterm borrowings and\nNote 15 for operating\nlease payments, and\n\u201cOff-Balance Sheet\nArrangements\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our various\ntypes of off-balance\nsheet arrangements.\n\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel. Our Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nmeasures our intraday\nliquidity needs in a\nscenario where access\nto sources of intraday\nliquidity may become\nconstrained. The\nintraday liquidity\nmodel considers a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding historical\nsettlement activity.\n\nLong-Term Stress\nTesting. We utilize\nlonger-term stress\ntests to take a\nforward view on our\nliquidity position\nthrough prolonged\nstress periods in\nwhich we experience a\nsevere liquidity\nstress and recover in\nan environment that\ncontinues to be\nchallenging. We are\nfocused on ensuring\nconservative asset-\nliability management\nto prepare for a\nprolonged period of\npotential stress,\nseeking to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nResolution Liquidity\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established our\nResolution Liquidity\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich estimates\nliquidity needs of our\nmajor subsidiaries in\na stressed\nenvironment. The\nliquidity needs are\nmeasured using our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow assumptions\nand include certain\nadditional inter-\naffiliate exposures.\nWe have also\nestablished our\nResolution Liquidity\nExecution Need\nframework, which\nmeasures the liquidity\nneeds of our major\nsubsidiaries to\nstabilize and wind\ndown following a Group\nInc. bankruptcy filing\nin accordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIn addition, we have\nestablished a triggers\nand alerts framework,\nwhich is designed to\nprovide the Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc.\n                                              \n  Limits                                      \n                                              \nWe use liquidity risk\nlimits at various\nlevels and across\nliquidity risk types\nto manage the size of\nour liquidity\nexposures. Limits are\nmeasured relative to\nacceptable levels of\nrisk given our\nliquidity risk\ntolerance. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess.\n\nLimits are monitored\nby Corporate Treasury\nand Liquidity Risk.\nLiquidity Risk is\nresponsible for\nidentifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded.\n                                              \n  GCLA and Unencumbered Metrics               \n                                              \nGCLA.

Inherent\nlimitations to VaR\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 VaR does not\nestimate potential\nlosses over longer\ntime horizons where\nmoves may be extreme;\n\n\u2022 VaR does not take\naccount of the\nrelative liquidity of\ndifferent risk\npositions; and\n\n\u2022 Previous moves in\nmarket risk factors\nmay not produce\naccurate predictions\nof all future market\nmoves.\n\nTo comprehensively\ncapture our exposures\nand relevant risks in\nour VaR calculation,\nwe use historical\nsimulations with full\nvaluation of market\nfactors at the\nposition level by\nsimultaneously\nshocking the relevant\nmarket factors for\nthat position. These\nmarket factors include\nspot prices, credit\nspreads, funding\nspreads, yield curves,\nvolatility and\ncorrelation, and are\nupdated periodically\nbased on changes in\nthe composition of\npositions, as well as\nvariations in market\nconditions. We sample\nfrom five years of\nhistorical data to\ngenerate the scenarios\nfor our VaR\ncalculation. The\nhistorical data is\nweighted so that the\nrelative importance of\nthe data reduces over\ntime. This gives\ngreater importance to\nmore recent\nobservations and\nreflects current asset\nvolatilities, which\nimproves the accuracy\nof our estimates of\npotential loss. As a\nresult, even if our\npositions included in\nVaR were unchanged,\nour VaR would increase\nwith increasing market\nvolatility and vice\nversa.\n\nGiven its reliance on\nhistorical data, VaR\nis most effective in\nestimating risk\nexposures in markets\nin which there are no\nsudden fundamental\nchanges or shifts in\nmarket conditions.\n\nOur VaR measure does\nnot include:\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nnot accounted for at\nfair value, such as\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities and loans,\ndeposits and unsecured\nborrowings that are\naccounted for at\namortized cost;\n\n\u2022 Available-for-sale\nsecurities for which\nthe related unrealized\nfair value gains and\nlosses are included in\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss);\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nbest measured and\nmonitored using\nsensitivity measures;\nand\n\n\u2022 The impact of\nchanges in\ncounterparty and our\nown credit spreads on\nderivatives, as well\nas changes in our own\ncredit spreads on\nfinancial liabilities\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected.\n\nWe perform daily\nbacktesting of our VaR\nmodel (i.e., comparing\ndaily net revenues for\npositions included in\nVaR to the VaR measure\ncalculated as of the\nprior business day) at\nthe firmwide level and\nfor each of our\nbusinesses and major\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nEarnings-at-Risk. We\nmanage our interest\nrate risk using the\nEaR metric. EaR\nmeasures the estimated\nimpact of changes in\ninterest rates to our\nnet revenues and\npreferred stock\ndividends over a\ndefined time horizon.\nEaR complements the\nVaR metric, which\nmeasures the impact of\ninterest rate changes\nthat have an immediate\nimpact on the fair\nvalues of our assets\nand liabilities (i.e.,\nmark-to-market\nchanges).

We\nmeasure EaR over a\none-year time horizon,\nincluding a 100- and\n200-basis point\ninstantaneous parallel\nshock in both short-\nand long-term interest\nrates. This\nsensitivity is\ncalculated relative to\na baseline market\nscenario, which takes\ninto consideration,\namong other things,\nthe market\u2019s\nexpectation of forward\nrates, as well as our\nexpectation of future\nbusiness activity.\nThese scenarios\ninclude contractual\nelements of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock, and certain\noff-balance sheet\ninstruments, such as\nrates of interest,\nprincipal repayment\nschedules, maturity\nand reset dates, and\nany interest rate\nceilings or floors, as\nwell as assumptions\nwith respect to our\nbalance sheet size and\ncomposition,\nprepayment behavior\nand deposit repricing.\nDeposit repricing is\ncaptured by evaluating\nthe change in deposit\nrate paid relative to\nthe change in market\nrates (deposit beta)\nand we calibrate the\ndeposit betas used in\nour models by using a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding observed\nhistorical behavior,\nfuture expectations,\nfunding needs and the\ncompetitive landscape.\nWe continuously\nmonitor the\nperformance of our key\nassumptions against\nobserved behavior and\nregularly review their\nsensitivity on our\nrisk metrics.\n\nWe manage EaR with a\ngoal to reduce\npotential volatility\nresulting from changes\nin interest rates so\nit remains within our\nEaR risk appetite. Our\nEaR scenario is\nregularly evaluated\nand updated, if\nnecessary, to reflect\nchanges in our\nbusiness plans, market\nconditions and other\nmacroeconomic factors.\nWhile management uses\nthe best information\navailable to estimate\nEaR, actual results\nmay differ materially\nas a result of, among\nother things, changes\nin the economic\nenvironment or\nassumptions used in\nthe process. We also\nmeasure the\nsensitivity of the\neconomic value of our\nequity (EVE) to\nchanges in interest\nrates. Compared to\nEaR, EVE provides a\nlonger-term\nmeasurement of the\ninterest rate risk\nexposure, primarily on\nnon-trading assets and\nliabilities, by\ncapturing the net\nimpact of changes in\ninterest rates to the\npresent value of their\ncash flows.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    146  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Risk,\nwhich is part of our\nsecond line of defense\nand reports to our\nchief risk officer,\nhas primary\nresponsibility for\nassessing, monitoring\nand managing our\ninterest rate risk\n(including EaR and EVE\nsensitivity) by\nproviding independent\nfirmwide oversight and\nchallenge across our\nglobal businesses.\nStress Testing. Stress\ntesting is a method of\ndetermining the effect\nof various\nhypothetical stress\nscenarios. We use\nstress tests to\nexamine risks of\nspecific portfolios,\nas well as the\npotential impact of\nour significant risk\nexposures. We use a\nvariety of stress\ntesting techniques to\ncalculate the\npotential loss from a\nwide range of market\nmoves on our\nportfolios, including\nfirmwide stress tests,\nsensitivity analysis\nand scenario analysis.\nThe results of our\nvarious stress tests\nare analyzed together\nfor risk management\npurposes. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\nSensitivity analysis\nis used to quantify\nthe impact of a market\nmove in a single risk\nfactor across all\npositions (e.g.,\nequity prices or\ncredit spreads) using\na variety of defined\nmarket shocks, ranging\nfrom those that could\nbe expected over a\none-day time horizon\nup to those that could\ntake many months to\noccur. We also use\nsensitivity analysis\nto quantify the impact\nof the default of any\nsingle entity, which\ncaptures the risk of\nlarge or concentrated\nexposures. Scenario\nanalysis is used to\nquantify the impact of\na specified event,\nincluding how the\nevent impacts multiple\nrisk factors\nsimultaneously. For\nexample, for sovereign\nstress testing we\ncalculate potential\ndirect exposure\nassociated with our\nsovereign positions,\nas well as the\ncorresponding debt,\nequity and currency\nexposures associated\nwith our non-sovereign\npositions that may be\nimpacted by the\nsovereign distress.\nWhen conducting\nscenario analysis, we\noften consider a\nnumber of possible\noutcomes for each\nscenario, ranging from\nmoderate to severely\nadverse market\nimpacts. In addition,\nthese stress tests are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical events and\nforward-looking\nhypothetical\nscenarios. Unlike VaR\nmeasures, which have\nan implied probability\nbecause they are\ncalculated at a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, there may not\nbe an implied\nprobability that our\nstress testing\nscenarios will occur.\nInstead, stress\ntesting is used to\nmodel both moderate\nand more extreme moves\nin underlying market\nfactors. When\nestimating potential\nloss, we generally\nassume that our\npositions cannot be\nreduced or hedged\n(although experience\ndemonstrates that we\nare generally able to\ndo so).\n\nLimits We use market\nrisk limits at various\nlevels to manage the\nsize of our market\nexposures. These\nlimits are set based\non VaR, EaR and on a\nrange of stress tests\nrelevant to our\nexposures. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess. Limits are\nmonitored by Corporate\nTreasury and Risk.\nRisk is responsible\nfor identifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded (e.g., due to\npositional changes or\nchanges in market\nconditions, such as\nincreased volatilities\nor changes in\ncorrelations). Such\ninstances are\nremediated by a\nreduction in the\npositions we hold\nand/or a temporary or\npermanent increase to\nthe limit, if\nwarranted. Metrics We\nanalyze VaR at the\nfirmwide level and a\nvariety of more\ndetailed levels,\nincluding by risk\ncategory, business and\nregion.\nDiversification effect\nin the tables below\nrepresents the\ndifference between\ntotal VaR and the sum\nof the VaRs for the\nfour risk categories.\nThis effect arises\nbecause the four\nmarket risk categories\nare not perfectly\ncorrelated.\nSubstantially all\npositions in VaR are\nincluded within Global\nBanking & Markets.

Credit Risk Management Overview Credit\nrisk represents the potential for loss due to\nthe default or deterioration in credit quality\nof a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives\ncounterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of\nsecurities or other instruments we hold. Our\nexposure to credit risk comes mostly from\nclient transactions in OTC derivatives and\nloans and lending commitments. Credit risk\nalso comes from cash placed with banks,\nsecurities financing transactions (i.e.,\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending activities)\nand customer and other receivables.\n\nCredit Risk, which is part of our second line\nof defense and reports to our chief risk\nofficer, has primary responsibility for\nassessing, monitoring and managing our credit\nrisk by providing independent firmwide\noversight and challenge across our global\nbusinesses. In addition, we hold other\npositions that give rise to credit risk (e.g.,\nbonds and secondary bank loans). These credit\nrisks are captured as a component of market\nrisk measures, which are monitored and managed\nby Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives\nto manage market risk exposures. Such\nderivatives also give rise to credit risk,\nwhich is monitored and managed by Credit Risk.\nCredit Risk Management Process Our process for\nmanaging credit risk includes the critical\ncomponents of our risk management framework\ndescribed in the \u201cOverview and Structure of\nRisk Management,\u201d as well as the following: \u2022\nMonitoring compliance with established credit\nrisk limits and reporting our credit exposures\nand credit concentrations; \u2022 Establishing or\napproving underwriting standards; \u2022 Assessing\nthe likelihood that a counterparty will\ndefault on its payment obligations; \u2022\nMeasuring our current and potential credit\nexposure and losses resulting from a\ncounterparty default; \u2022 Using credit risk\nmitigants, including collateral and hedging;\nand \u2022 Maximizing recovery through active\nworkout and restructuring of claims. We also\nperform credit analyses, which incorporate\ninitial and ongoing evaluations of the\ncapacity and willingness of a counterparty to\nmeet its financial obligations. For\nsubstantially all of our credit exposures, the\ncore of our process is an annual counterparty\ncredit evaluation or more frequently if deemed\nnecessary as a result of events or changes in\ncircumstances. We determine an internal credit\nrating for the counterparty by considering the\nresults of the credit evaluations and\nassumptions with respect to the nature of and\noutlook for the counterparty\u2019s industry and\nthe economic environment. For collateralized\nloans, we also take into consideration\ncollateral received or other credit support\narrangements when determining an internal\ncredit rating. Senior personnel, with\nexpertise in specific industries, inspect and\napprove credit reviews and internal credit\nratings. Our risk assessment process may also\ninclude, where applicable, reviewing certain\nkey metrics, including, but not limited to,\ndelinquency status, collateral value, FICO\ncredit scores and other risk factors.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2025 Form 10-Q    150  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For\nloans and lending\ncommitments, the\nprimary measure is a\nfunction of the\nnotional amount of the\nposition.\n                                              \n  Stress Tests                                \n                                              \nWe conduct regular\nstress tests to\ncalculate the credit\nexposures, including\npotential\nconcentrations that\nwould result from\napplying shocks to\ncounterparty credit\nratings or credit risk\nfactors (e.g.,\ncurrency rates,\ninterest rates, equity\nprices). These shocks\ncover a wide range of\nmoderate and more\nextreme market\nmovements, including\nshocks to multiple\nrisk factors,\nconsistent with the\noccurrence of a severe\nmarket or economic\nevent. In the case of\nsovereign default, we\nestimate the direct\nimpact of the default\non our sovereign\ncredit exposures,\nchanges to our credit\nexposures arising from\npotential market moves\nin response to the\ndefault, and the\nimpact of credit\nmarket deterioration\non corporate borrowers\nand counterparties\nthat may result from\nthe sovereign default.\nUnlike potential\nexposure, which is\ncalculated within a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, stress testing\ndoes not generally\nassume a probability\nof these events\noccurring.

We may\nalso reduce credit\nrisk with\ncounterparties by\nentering into\nagreements that enable\nus to obtain\ncollateral from them\non an upfront or\ncontingent basis\nand/or to terminate\ntransactions if the\ncounterparty\u2019s credit\nrating falls below a\nspecified level. We\nmonitor the fair value\nof the collateral to\nensure that our credit\nexposures are\nappropriately\ncollateralized. We\nseek to minimize\nexposures where there\nis a significant\npositive correlation\nbetween the\ncreditworthiness of\nour counterparties and\nthe market value of\ncollateral we receive.\n\nFor loans and lending\ncommitments, depending\non the credit quality\nof the borrower and\nother characteristics\nof the transaction, we\nemploy a variety of\npotential risk\nmitigants. Risk\nmitigants include\ncollateral provisions,\nguarantees, covenants,\nstructural seniority\nof the bank loan\nclaims and, for\ncertain lending\ncommitments,\nprovisions in the\nlegal documentation\nthat allow us to\nadjust loan amounts,\npricing, structure and\nother terms as market\nconditions change. The\ntype and structure of\nrisk mitigants\nemployed can\nsignificantly\ninfluence the degree\nof credit risk\ninvolved in a loan or\nlending commitment.\n\nWhen we do not have\nsufficient visibility\ninto a counterparty\u2019s\nfinancial strength or\nwhen we believe a\ncounterparty requires\nsupport from its\nparent, we may obtain\nthird-party guarantees\nof the counterparty\u2019s\nobligations.

OTC Derivatives.\nOur credit exposure on\nOTC derivatives arises\nprimarily from our\nmarket-making\nactivities. As a\nmarket maker, we enter\ninto derivative\ntransactions to\nprovide liquidity to\nclients and to\nfacilitate the\ntransfer and hedging\nof their risks. We\nalso enter into\nderivatives to manage\nmarket risk exposures.\nWe manage our credit\nexposure on OTC\nderivatives using the\ncredit risk process,\nmeasures, limits and\nrisk mitigants\ndescribed above.\n\nWe generally enter\ninto OTC derivatives\ntransactions under\nbilateral collateral\narrangements that\nrequire the daily\nexchange of\ncollateral. As credit\nrisk is an essential\ncomponent of fair\nvalue, we include a\ncredit valuation\nadjustment (CVA) in\nthe fair value of\nderivatives to reflect\ncounterparty credit\nrisk, as described in\nNote 7 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements.

OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal\nProceedings We are involved in a number of\njudicial, regulatory and arbitration\nproceedings concerning matters arising in\nconnection with the conduct of our businesses.\nMany of these proceedings are in early stages,\nand many of these cases seek an indeterminate\namount of damages. We have estimated the upper\nend of the range of reasonably possible\naggregate loss for matters where we have been\nable to estimate a range and we believe, based\non currently available information, that the\nresults of matters where we have not been able\nto estimate a range of reasonably possible\nloss, in the aggregate, will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial\ncondition, but may be material to our\noperating results in a given period. Given the\nrange of litigation and investigations\npresently under way, our litigation expenses\nmay remain high.
