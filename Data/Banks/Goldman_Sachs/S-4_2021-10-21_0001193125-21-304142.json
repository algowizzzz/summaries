On [\u0097], [\u0097], a Delaware limited\nliability company and wholly owned subsidiary\nof GS Bank (\u0093Merger Sub 1\u0094), and [\u0097], a\nGeorgia limited liability company and wholly\nowned subsidiary of GS Bank (\u0093Merger\nSub 2\u0094), became party to the merger agreement\nthrough the execution of a joinder agreement\nto the merger agreement. Upon the terms and\nsubject to the conditions set forth in the\nmerger agreement, (i) GreenSky will be merged\nwith and into\nMerger Sub 1 (the \u0093company merger\u0094), with\nMerger Sub 1 surviving the company merger as a\nwholly owned subsidiary of GS Bank, and (ii)\nMerger Sub 2 will be merged with and into\nGreenSky Holdings (the \u0093Holdings merger\u0094\nand, together with the company merger, the\n\u0093mergers\u0094), with GreenSky Holdings surviving\nthe Holdings merger as a subsidiary of GS Bank\nand Merger Sub 1 (\u0093Surviving LLC 2\u0094).\n\nOn the terms and subject to the conditions set\nforth in the merger agreement, at the\neffective time of the company merger (the\n\u0093company\nmerger effective time\u0094), each share of Class A\ncommon stock, par value $0.01 per share, of\nGreenSky (\u0093GreenSky Class A common stock\u0094)\nissued and outstanding immediately prior to\nthe company merger effective time, other than\nshares of GreenSky Class A common stock owned\nby GreenSky as treasury stock or owned by GS\nGroup, GS Bank, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2,\nin each case, not on behalf of third parties\n(including in a fiduciary, custodial, nominee\nor similar\ncapacity), will be converted into the right to\nreceive 0.03 shares (the \u0093exchange ratio\u0094) of\ncommon stock, par value $0.01 per share, of GS\nGroup (\u0093GS Group common stock\u0094 and, such stock\nconsideration, the \u0093merger\nconsideration\u0094). As of the effective time of\nthe Holdings merger (the \u0093Holdings merger\neffective time\u0094 and together with the company\nmerger effective time, the \u0093effective time\u0094),\neach share of Class B common stock, par\nvalue $0.001 per share, of GreenSky (\u0093GreenSky\nClass B common stock\u0094 and, together with the\nGreenSky Class A common stock, the \u0093GreenSky\ncommon stock\u0094) shall be automatically deemed\ntransferred to GreenSky, canceled and\ncease to exist for no consideration. As of the\nHoldings merger effective time, each common\nunit of GreenSky Holdings (\u0093Common Units\u0094)\nwill be converted into the right to receive\nthe merger consideration, other than Common\nUnits that are\nowned by GreenSky, which shall be converted\ninto an equal number of limited liability\ncompany interests in Surviving LLC 2.\n\nGreenSky\ncommon stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market (\u0093NASDAQ\u0094) under the ticker\nsymbol \u0093GSKY\u0094 and GS Group common stock is\ntraded on the New York Stock Exchange (\u0093NYSE\u0094)\nunder the ticker symbol \u0093GS\u0094.\nBased on the closing price of GS Group common\nstock on the NYSE of $403.69 on September 14,\n2021, the last full trading day before the\ndate of the public announcement of the\nmergers, the exchange ratio represented\napproximately $12.11 in\nimplied value for each share of GreenSky Class\nA common stock and each Common Unit. Based on\nthe closing price of GS Group common stock on\nthe NYSE of $[\u0097] on [\u0097], the last practicable\ndate before the date of the accompanying proxy\nstatement/prospectus, the\n\nexchange ratio represented approximately $[\u0097]\nin implied value for each share of GreenSky\nClass A common stock and each Common Unit.\nAlthough the number of shares of GS Group\ncommon stock that you will receive in\nconnection with the mergers is fixed, the\nmarket value of the merger consideration will\nfluctuate with changes in the market price of\nGS Group common stock and may be more or less\nthan, or the same as, the merger consideration\non the date of the accompanying proxy\nstatement/prospectus or at the time that you\nvote. We urge you to obtain current market\nquotations for shares of GS Group common stock\nand GreenSky ClassA common stock.\n\nBased upon the number of outstanding shares of\nGreenSky Class A common stock, the number of\noutstanding Common Units and\nthe number of outstanding GreenSky equity\nawards, other than options, in each case, as\nof [\u0097], if the mergers are completed, we\nanticipate that GS Group will issue\napproximately [\u0097] shares of GS Group common\nstock in connection with the\nmergers. Based upon the number of shares of\nGreenSky Class A common stock, the number of\nCommon Units, the number of GreenSky equity\nawards, other than options, and the number of\nshares of GS Group common stock, in each case,\noutstanding on\n[\u0097], we expect that, immediately after the\nconsummation of the mergers, the former\nholders of GreenSky Class A common stock,\nCommon Units and GreenSky equity awards\nimmediately prior to the consummation of the\nmergers (ignoring any shares\nof GS Group common stock they may already own)\nwould own approximately [\u0097]%, and the holders\nof GS Group common stock immediately prior to\nthe consummation of the mergers would own\napproximately [\u0097]%, of the outstanding GS\nGroup\ncommon stock. The number of shares of GS Group\ncommon stock that will be issued in the\nmergers will depend on, among other factors,\nthe number of shares of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock, Common Units and GreenSky equity\nawards outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time.\n\nGreenSky will hold a special meeting of its\nstockholders online via live webcast on [\u0097],\n(including any adjournment or postponement\nthereof, the \u0093special meeting\u0094) in connection\nwith the mergers and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement\n(collectively, the \u0093transaction\u0094). The special\nmeeting can\nbe accessed by visiting [\u0097], where you will be\nable to participate in the meeting live and\nvote online. We encourage you to allow ample\ntime for online check-in, which will open at\n[\u0097], Eastern Time.\nPlease note that because there will not be a\nphysical meeting location, you will not be\nable to attend the special meeting in person.\n\nAt\nthe special meeting, GreenSky stockholders\nwill be asked to consider and vote on (i) a\nproposal to adopt the merger agreement and the\ntransaction (the \u0093GreenSky merger proposal\u0094),\n(ii) a proposal to approve, by advisory (non-\nbinding) vote, the compensation that may be\npaid or become payable to the named executive\nofficers of GreenSky in connection with the\nconsummation of the mergers (the\n\u0093non-binding compensation proposal\u0094) and (iii)\na proposal to approve the adjournment of the\nspecial meeting from time to time, if\nnecessary or appropriate, to solicit\nadditional proxies in\nfavor of the GreenSky merger proposal if there\nare insufficient votes at the time of such\nadjournment to approve the GreenSky merger\nproposal (the \u0093adjournment proposal\u0094).\n\nYour vote is very important, regardless of the\nnumber of shares you own. The record date for\ndetermining the GreenSky stockholders\nentitled to receive notice of, and to vote at,\nthe special meeting is the close of business\non [\u0097]. The transaction cannot be completed\nunless the holders of a majority of the voting\npower of the shares of GreenSky common stock\noutstanding as\nof the close of business on [\u0097], vote in favor\nof the GreenSky merger proposal at the special\nmeeting. The obligations of GreenSky and GS\nGroup to complete the transaction are subject\nto the satisfaction or waiver (if permissible\nunder\napplicable law) of certain conditions set\nforth in the merger agreement. More\ninformation about GreenSky, GS Group, GS Bank,\nMerger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the special\nmeeting, the merger agreement and the\ntransaction, including the mergers, is\nincluded in the accompanying proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nIT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU VOTE YOUR SHARES OF\nGREENSKY COMMON STOCK PROMPTLY.

We urge you to read carefully\nthe remainder of this document because the\ninformation in this section may not provide\nall the information that might be important to\nyou in determining how to vote. Additional\nimportant information is also contained in the\nannexes to, and the documents incorporated by\nreference in, this proxy statement/prospectus.\nSee \u0093 Where You Can Find More Information\u0094\nbeginning on page 163 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n                                              \n  Q:  Why am I receiving this proxy           \n      statement/prospectus and proxy card?    \n                                              \n                                              \n      GreenSky has agreed to be acquired by   \n      GS Group pursuant to the terms and      \n      subject to the conditions of the        \n      merger agreement that is described in   \n      this proxy statement/prospectus. In     \n      connection with the mergers, GreenSky   \n      will merge with and into Merger Sub 1,  \n      a new wholly owned subsidiary of GS     \n      Bank, with Merger Sub 1 being the       \n      surviving entity and Merger             \n      Sub 2, a new wholly owned subsidiary    \n      of GS Bank, will merge with and into    \n      GreenSky Holdings, with GreenSky        \n  A:  Holdings being the surviving entity.    \n      In order for the mergers and the other  \n      transactions contemplated by the        \n      merger agreement to be completed,       \n      among other things, GreenSky            \n      stockholders need to vote to adopt the  \n      merger agreement. GreenSky is holding   \n      the special meeting to ask its          \n      stockholders to consider and vote       \n      upon, among other things, a proposal    \n      to adopt the merger agreement (which    \n      we                                      \n      refer to as the \u0093GreenSky merger         \n      proposal\u0094).                              \n                                              \nThis proxy statement/prospectus includes\nimportant information about the mergers, the\nmerger agreement, a copy of which is attached\nas Annex Ato this proxy statement/prospectus,\nand the special meeting. GreenSky stockholders\nshould read this information carefully and in\nits entirety. The enclosed voting materials\nallow GreenSky stockholders to vote their\nshares without attending the special meeting.\nGreenSky stockholders who hold their shares\nthrough a bank, broker or other nominee in\n\u0093street name\u0094 must follow the voting\ninstructions provided by their bank, broker or\nother nominee in order to vote their shares.\nThe vote of each GreenSky stockholder is\nimportant. GreenSky encourages each GreenSky\nstockholder to vote as soon as possible.\n                                              \n  Q:  Why is GreenSky proposing the mergers?  \n                                              \n                                              \n      The GreenSky board carefully reviewed   \n      and considered the terms and            \n      conditions of the merger agreement,     \n      including the mergers and the other     \n      transactions contemplated thereby. The  \n      GreenSky board, acting on the           \n      unanimous recommendation of the         \n      GreenSky special committee, (i)\u00a0        \n      determined that it was in the best      \n      interests of GreenSky and its           \n      stockholders and declared it advisable  \n      that GreenSky enter into the merger     \n      agreement and other related agreements  \n      and consummate the transactions         \n      contemplated thereby, (ii)\u00a0approved     \n      and adopted the merger agreement and    \n      other related agreements,               \n  A:  (iii)\u00a0resolved to recommend that        \n      GreenSky stockholders vote for the      \n      adoption of the merger agreement and    \n      (iv)\u00a0directed that the merger           \n      agreement and the transactions          \n      contemplated thereby be submitted to    \n      GreenSky stockholders for adoption.     \n      For more information regarding key      \n      factors the GreenSky board considered   \n      in determining to recommend the         \n      adoption of the merger agreement by     \n      GreenSky stockholders, see the section  \n      entitled \u0093The Mergers\u0097GreenSky\u0092s Reasons   \n      for the                                 \n      Mergers; Recommendation of the          \n      GreenSky Board of Directors\u0094 beginning   \n      on page 67 of this proxy                \n      statement/prospectus.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Q:  What am I being asked to vote on at     \n      the special meeting?                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      At the special meeting, GreenSky        \n  A:  stockholders will be asked to consider  \n      and vote on the following proposals:    \n                                              \n1. Proposal 1.The GreenSky merger proposal,\npursuant to which GreenSky stockholders are\nbeing asked to adopt the merger agreement; 2.\nProposal 2. The non-bindingcompensation\nproposal, pursuant to which GreenSky\nstockholders are being asked to approve, by\nadvisory (nonbinding) vote (which we refer to\nas the \u0093non-bindingcompensation -1-\n\nproposal\u0094), the compensation that may be paid\nor become payable to the named executive\nofficers of GreenSky in connection with the\nconsummation of the mergers (which we refer to\nas the \u0093transaction-relatedcompensation\u0094); and\n3. Proposal 3.The adjournment proposal,\npursuant to which GreenSky stockholders are\nbeing asked to approve the adjournment of the\nspecial meeting from time to time, if\nnecessary or appropriate, to solicit\nadditional proxies in favor of the GreenSky\nmerger proposal if there are insufficient\nvotes at the time of such adjournment to\napprove such proposal (which we refer to as\nthe \u0093adjournment proposal\u0094). The approval of\nthe GreenSky merger proposal is a condition to\nclosing under the merger agreement, as\nGreenSky stockholders must adopt the merger\nagreement in order for the mergers to occur.\nIf GreenSky stockholders fail to approve the\nGreenSky merger proposal, the mergers will not\noccur. The approval of the non-\nbindingcompensation proposal and the\nadjournment proposal are not conditions to the\ncompletion of the mergers.\n                                              \n  Q:  What is the vote required to approve    \n      each proposal at the special meeting?   \n                                              \n                                              \n      Proposal 1: GreenSky Merger Proposal.   \n      The GreenSky merger proposal requires   \n      the affirmative vote of the             \n  A:  holders of a majority of the voting     \n      power of the outstanding shares of      \n      GreenSky common stock entitled to vote  \n      thereon.                                \n                                              \nProposal 2: Non-BindingCompensation Proposal.\nThe non-bindingcompensation proposal requires\nthe affirmative vote of the holders of a\nmajority of the votes cast by the GreenSky\nstockholders entitled to vote on the proposal\nwho are present in person or represented by\nproxy. Proposal 3: Adjournment Proposal. The\nadjournment proposal requires the affirmative\nvote of the holders of a majority of the votes\nentitled to be cast by the GreenSky\nstockholders who are present in person or by\nproxy, whether or not a quorum is present. The\napproval of the GreenSky merger proposal is a\ncondition to closing under the merger\nagreement, as GreenSky stockholders must adopt\nthe merger agreement in order for the mergers\nto occur. If GreenSky stockholders fail to\napprove the GreenSky merger proposal, the\nmergers will not occur. On September 14, 2021,\nconcurrently with the execution of the merger\nagreement and as a condition to GS Group\u0092s and\nGS Bank\u0092s entry into the merger agreement,\nDavid Zalik, chairman of the GreenSky board\nand GreenSky\u0092s Chief Executive Officer, and\ncertain of his affiliates, who, as of\nSeptember 30, 2021, collectively and in the\naggregate held voting power over approximately\n56% of the outstanding GreenSky common stock,\nentered into a voting agreement with GS Group\nand GS Bank, pursuant to which they have\nagreed, among other things, to vote their\nshares of GreenSky common stock in favor of\nthe approval of the merger agreement and the\ntransaction contemplated thereby at the\nspecial meeting, with certain exceptions (as\nfurther described in the section entitled \u0093\nThe Mergers\u0097Voting Agreement\u0094 beginning on\npage 99 of this proxy statement/prospectus).\nAs a result, and subject to the terms of the\nvoting agreement and certain exceptions\ntherein, the approval of the GreenSky merger\nproposal is effectively assured. Furthermore,\nat the close of business on the record date,\napproximately [\u0097]% of the issued and\noutstanding shares of GreenSky Class A common\nstock and [\u0097]% of the issued and outstanding\nshares of GreenSky Class B common stock,\ncollectively accounting for approximately [\u0097]%\nof the total voting power of GreenSky common\nstock, was directly held by GreenSky\u0092s\ndirectors and executive officers, other than\nMr. Zalik. For additional information\nregarding the ownership of GreenSky common\nstock by GreenSky\u0092s directors, executive\nofficers and certain stockholders, see the\nsection entitled \u0093 Certain Beneficial Owners\nof GreenSky Common Stock\u0094, beginning on page\n155 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

For additional information, see the\nsection entitled \u0093The Mergers\u0097Interests of\nGreenSky\u0092s Directors and Executive Officers\nin the Mergers\u0094 beginning on page 94 of this\nproxy statement/prospectus.\n\nHoldback Agreement (Page 99)\n\nConcurrently with the execution of the merger\nagreement and as a condition to GS Group\u0092s\nand GS Bank\u0092s entry into the merger\nagreement, GreenSky\u0092s chief executive\nofficer, Mr. David Zalik, entered into a\nholdback agreement with GS Group (the\n\u0093holdback agreement\u0094), pursuant to which he\nagreed that 326,984 shares of the common\nstock of GS Group that he\notherwise would have been entitled to receive\nas merger consideration in respect of Common\nUnits held by him and his affiliates shall\ninstead be paid in the form of shares of GS\nGroup restricted stock (the \u0093holdback\nshares\u0094). Among other\nthings, the holdback shares will, subject to\ncertain exceptions, be subject to transfer\nrestrictions until the second anniversary of\nthe closing date and will be forfeited if Mr.\nZalik is not actively employed by GS Group or\nits affiliates on\nsuch anniversary.\n\nVoting Agreement (Page 99)\n\nConcurrently with the execution of the merger\nagreement and as a condition to GS Group\u0092s\nand GS Bank\u0092s entry into the merger\nagreement, GS Group and GS Bank entered into\na voting agreement with Mr. Zalik and certain\nof his affiliates, who, collectively and in\nthe aggregate, as of September 30, 2021, hold\nvoting power over approximately 56% of the\noutstanding\nGreenSky common stock, pursuant to which,\namong other things, each such stockholder\nagreed to vote all of his or its subject\nshares in favor of the approval of the merger\nagreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby; provided that in the\nevent of an adverse recommendation change,\nthe aggregate number of shares of GreenSky\ncommon stock required to be voted in favor of\nthe approval of the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby will be\nreduced to the aggregate\nnumber of shares holding voting power with\nrespect to 35% of the outstanding GreenSky\ncommon stock, and each such GreenSky\nstockholder\u0092s obligation to vote his or its\nsubject shares in favor of approval of the\nmerger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby will be\nreduced by its pro rata portion of the excess\nsubject shares.\n\nThe voting agreement will\nterminate automatically as of the earliest of\n(a) the effective time, (b) the termination\nof the merger agreement in accordance with\nits terms, (c) the mutual agreement of the\nparties thereto and (d) with respect to any\nGreenSky\nstockholder subject to the voting agreement,\nsuch time as any modification or amendment to\nthe merger agreement or the holdback\nagreement is effected without such GreenSky\nstockholder\u0092s consent that reduces the merger\nconsideration, changes the\nform of the merger consideration or otherwise\nadversely affects such GreenSky stockholder\nin any material respect.\n\nBackstop Loan Participation Purchase Facility\nCommitment Letter (Page 99)\n\nConcurrently with the execution of the merger\nagreement and as a condition to GreenSky\u0092s\nentry into the merger agreement, certain of\nGreenSky\u0092s subsidiaries entered into a\ncommitment letter for a backstop loan\nparticipation purchase facility (the\n\u0093commitment letter\u0094) with GS Bank. Pursuant\nto the commitment letter, GS Bank has\ncommitted to provide such subsidiaries\nwith (i) a commitment of up to $0.8 billion\nto purchase economic participations in loans\noriginated by GreenSky\u0092s bank partners under\nthe GreenSky program during the period from\nthe execution of definitive agreements for\nsuch purchase\nfacility through the earlier of the\nconsummation of the mergers and the\ntermination of the merger agreement in\naccordance with its terms, or (ii) in\n\n-19-\n\nthe event that the merger agreement is\nterminated in accordance with its terms prior\nto the consummation of the mergers, a\ncommitment of up to $1.0 billion to purchase\neconomic\nparticipations in loans originated by\nGreenSky\u0092s bank partners under the GreenSky\nprogram during the period from the merger\nagreement termination date through the last\nday of the ninth full calendar month\nfollowing such termination date. The\ncommitment letter provides that the\ndefinitive agreements for the purchase\nfacility will contain customary\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants,\nindemnification and termination provisions.\n\nTax Receivable Agreement Amendment (Page 100)\n\nAs a condition to GS Group\u0092s and GS Bank\u0092s\nentry into the merger agreement, GreenSky and\ncertain beneficiaries party to the Tax\nReceivable Agreement, dated as of May 23,\n2018 (the \u0093tax receivable agreement\u0094), by and\namong GreenSky, GreenSky Holdings, GreenSky,\nLLC and the blocker corporations and\nbeneficiaries party thereto, were required to\nenter into an\namendment to the Tax Receivable Agreement\n(the \u0093tax receivable agreement amendment\u0094),\nwhich amendment provided that no payments\nunder the tax receivable agreement will be\nmade following or as a result of the\nconsummation of the mergers.\n\nRegulatory Approvals (Page 100)\n\nThe consummation of the mergers is subject to\nantitrust review in the United States. Under\nthe Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements\nAct of\n1976, as amended (the \u0093HSR Act\u0094), and the\nrules promulgated thereunder, the mergers\ncannot be completed until the parties to the\nmerger agreement have given notification and\nfurnished information to the Federal Trade\nCommission (the\n\u0093FTC\u0094) and the United States Department of\nJustice (the \u0093DOJ\u0094), and until the applicable\nwaiting period has expired or has been\nterminated. At any time before or after\nconsummation of the mergers, notwithstanding\nthe termination\nof the applicable waiting period under the\nHSR Act, the FTC, the DOJ or any state could\ntake such action under antitrust laws as it\ndeems necessary or desirable in the public\ninterest, including seeking to enjoin the\nconsummation of the mergers or\nseeking the divestiture of substantial assets\nof GreenSky, GS Group or their respective\nsubsidiaries. Private parties may also seek\nto take legal action under antitrust laws\nunder certain circumstances. GS Group and\nGreenSky filed their required HSR\nAct filings on September 24, 2021. The\napplicable waiting period will expire at\n11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 25,\n2021.\n\nThe consummation of the mergers is also\nsubject to certain other certain regulatory\nauthorizations, consents, orders, non-\nobjections and approvals with governmental\nauthorities, including approval of the New\nYork State Department of Financial Services\n(the \u0093DFS\u0094) and certain state licensing\napprovals.\n\nIn connection with the mergers, GS Group has\nfiled a registration statement on Form S-4\nwith the SEC\nunder the Securities Act, of which this proxy\nstatement/prospectus forms a part, that must\nbe declared effective by the SEC and pursuant\nto which the issuance of shares of GS Group\ncommon stock issuable upon the effective time\nwill be registered\nwith the SEC.\n\nIn addition, the consummation of the mergers\nis subject to approval for listing of the\nshares of GS Group common stock to\nbe issued in connection with the mergers and\nreserved for issuance in connection with the\nmergers on the NYSE, subject to official\nnotice of issuance.\n\nAccounting Treatment (Page 100)\n\nGS Group prepares its financial statements in\naccordance with GAAP. The mergers will be\naccounted for using the acquisition method of\naccounting. GS Group will be treated as the\nacquirer for accounting purposes.\n\nNo Appraisal or Dissenters\u0092 Rights (Page 100)\n\nIn accordance with the DGCL, which governs\nthe company merger, no appraisal rights are\navailable to the GreenSky\nstockholders in connection with the company\nmerger.\n\n-20-\n\nIn addition, since the Holdings merger will\noccur immediately prior to the company\nmerger, all shares of GreenSky Class B common\nstock will be automatically deemed\ntransferred to GreenSky and canceled and\ncease to exist at the Holdings merger\neffective time, which is prior to the company\nmerger effective time. Accordingly, no shares\nof GreenSky Class B common stock will be\noutstanding at the company merger effective\ntime and the holders of GreenSky Class B\ncommon stock as of immediately prior to the\nHoldings merger effective time will not be\nentitled to any appraisal rights in\nconnection with the company merger.\nSolicitation;

Delisting and\nDeregistration of GreenSky Class A Common\nStock (Page 100) Prior to the consummation of\nthe mergers, GreenSky has agreed to cooperate\nwith GS Group and shall use its reasonable\nbest efforts to cause the shares of GreenSky\nClass A common stock to be de-listedfrom\nNASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange\nAct as soon as reasonably practicable\nfollowing the effective time. If the mergers\nare completed, GreenSky Class A common stock\nwill be delisted from the NASDAQ and\nderegistered under the Exchange Act, and\nGreenSky will no longer be required to file\nperiodic reports with the SEC with respect to\nGreenSky Class A common stock. NYSE Market\nListing (Page 100) The shares of GS Group\ncommon stock to be issued in connection with\nthe mergers will be listed for trading on the\nNYSE. Following the consummation of the\nmergers, shares of GS Group common stock will\ncontinue to be listed on the NYSE. Prior to\nthe consummation of the mergers, GS Group has\nagreed to use its best efforts to cause the\nshares of GS Group common stock to be issued\nin connection with the mergers to be approved\nfor listing on the NYSE, subject to official\nnotice of issuance. Closing and Effective\nTime of the Mergers Subject to the\nsatisfaction or waiver of the closing\nconditions described under the section\nentitled, \u0093 The Merger Agreement\u0097Conditions\nto the Mergers\u0094 beginning on page 120 of this\nproxy statement/prospectus, including the\napproval and adoption of the merger agreement\nby GreenSky stockholders at the special\nmeeting, GS Group and GreenSky expect that\nthe mergers will be consummated in the fourth\nquarter of 2021 or the first quarter of 2022.\nHowever, it is possible that factors outside\nthe control of both companies could result in\nthe transaction being completed at a\ndifferent time or not at all. Material United\nStates Federal Income Tax Consequences (Page\n124) As further described below in the\nsection entitled \u0093 Material United States\nFederal Income Tax Consequences\u0094, it is the\nopinion of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and\nSullivan & Cromwell LLP that the company\nmerger should qualify as a tax-\nfree\u0093reorganization\u0094 within the meaning of\nSection 368(a) of the Code (a\n\u0093Reorganization\u0094). Accordingly, the exchange\nof GreenSky Class A common stock for shares\nof GS Group common stock should be tax-freeto\nU.S. holders (as defined below under the\nsection entitled \u0093 Material United States\nFederal Income Tax Consequences\u0094), except\nwith respect to any cash received in lieu of\nfractional shares of GS Group common stock.\nThe exchange of Common Units for shares of GS\nGroup common stock (and cash in lieu of\nfractional shares of GS Group common stock,\nif any) in the Holdings merger will be a\ntaxable sale of a U.S. holder\u0092s Common Units\nin exchange for shares of GS Group common\nstock (and any cash received in lieu of\nfractional shares of GS Group common stock).\nA U.S. holder of Common Units who receives GS\nGroup common stock (and cash in lieu of\nfractional shares of GS Group common stock,\nif any) in exchange for Common Units pursuant\nto the Holdings merger will recognize gain or\nloss in an amount equal to the difference\nbetween (a) the sum of (x) the fair market\nvalue of the GS Group common stock received,\n(y) any cash received (including any cash in\nlieu of fractional shares of GS Group common\nstock) and (z) such U.S. holder\u0092s share of\nHoldings\u0092 liabilities\n\n-24-\n\nimmediately prior to the Holdings merger and\n(b) such U.S. holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in\nthe Common Units exchanged therefor (which\nwill include such U.S. holder\u0092s share of\nHoldings\u0092 liabilities immediately prior to\nthe Holdings merger).\n\nYou should read the section entitled\n\u0093Material United States Federal Income Tax\nConsequences\u0094 beginning on page 124 of this\nproxy statement/prospectus for a more\ncomplete discussion of the material United\nStates federal income tax consequences of the\nmergers.\n\nInformation About the GreenSky Special\nMeeting (Page 129)\n\nThe special meeting will be held on [\u0097], at\n[\u0097], Eastern Time and will be conducted\ncompletely online via the internet. GreenSky\nstockholders may attend and participate in\nthe special meeting by visiting the special\nmeeting website at [\u0097]. There will be no\nphysical location for the special meeting. To\naccess the special meeting, you will need the\n16-digit control number included on your\nproxy card or voting instruction form.\n\nWe encourage you to\naccess the special meeting before the start\ntime of [\u0097], Eastern Time. Please allow ample\ntime for online check-in, which will begin at\n[\u0097], Eastern Time.\n\nGreenSky has set the close of business on [\u0097]\nas the record date for the special meeting,\nand only holders of record of GreenSky\nClass A common stock and GreenSky Class B\ncommon stock on the record date are entitled\nto vote at the special meeting. As of the\nclose of business on the record date, there\nwere [\u0097] shares of GreenSky common stock\noutstanding,\nconsisting of [\u0097] shares of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock and [\u0097] shares of GreenSky Class\nB common stock. GreenSky Class A common stock\nand GreenSky Class B common stock will vote\ntogether as a single class on all\nmatters described in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus for which your vote is\nbeing solicited. On each matter properly\nbrought before the special meeting, each\nholder of GreenSky common stock is entitled\nto one vote per share of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock and ten votes per share of\nGreenSky Class B common stock held of record\nas of the record date. GreenSky common stock\nis the only security the holders of which are\nentitled to notice of, and to vote at, the\nspecial meeting.\n\nAt the special meeting, GreenSky stockholders\nwill be asked to consider and vote on (i) the\nGreenSky merger proposal, (ii) the non-\nbinding compensation proposal and (iii) the\nadjournment proposal.\n\nThe approval of the GreenSky\nmerger proposal is a condition to closing\nunder the merger agreement, as GreenSky\nstockholders must adopt the merger agreement\nin order for the mergers to occur. If\nGreenSky stockholders fail to adopt the\nmerger agreement, the mergers will not\noccur.\n\nBecause the vote on the non-binding\ncompensation proposal is only advisory in\nnature, it\nwill not be binding on GreenSky or GreenSky\nboard. Accordingly, because GreenSky is\ncontractually obligated to pay the\ncompensation, such compensation will be paid\nor become payable, subject only to the\nconditions applicable thereto, if the\ntransaction is consummated and regardless of\nthe outcome of the non-binding compensation\nproposal.\n\nTo be approved, the GreenSky merger proposal\nrequires the affirmative vote of the holders\nof a majority of the voting power of the\noutstanding\nshares of GreenSky common stock entitled to\nvote thereon. To be approved, the non-binding\ncompensation proposal requires the\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority\nof the votes cast by the GreenSky\nstockholders entitled to vote on the proposal\nwho are present in person (including\nvirtually) or represented by proxy at the\nspecial meeting. To be approved, the\nadjournment proposal requires the affirmative\nvote of the holders of a majority of the\nvotes entitled to be cast by the GreenSky\nstockholders who are present in person\n(including virtually) or by proxy at the\nspecial meeting, whether or not a quorum is\npresent. If a quorum is not present, the\nchairman of the special meeting or a\nmajority of the votes entitled to be cast by\nGreenSky stockholders present in person or by\nproxy at the special meeting may adjourn the\nmeeting.\n\n-25-\n\nMr. Zalik and certain of his affiliates own\nGreenSky common stock having the right to\nvote, as of September 30, 2021, approximately\n56% of the voting power of the shares of\nGreenSky common stock issued and outstanding\nas of the close of business on [\u0097].\nConcurrently with the execution of the merger\nagreement, Mr. Zalik\nand such affiliates entered into the voting\nagreement with GS Group and GS Bank described\nabove, pursuant to which, among other things,\nMr. Zalik and such affiliates have agreed to\nvote all of their shares of GreenSky common\nstock in favor of\nthe GreenSky merger proposal or, if the\nGreenSky board effects an adverse\nrecommendation change, a portion of their\nrespective shares of GreenSky common stock in\nfavor of the GreenSky merger proposal. Unless\nthe GreenSky board effects an adverse\nrecommendation change, the aggregate votes by\nMr. Zalik and such affiliates in favor of the\nGreenSky merger proposal will constitute the\napproval of the GreenSky merger proposal by\nthe requisite majority of the voting power of\nthe shares of\nGreenSky common stock outstanding as of the\nclose of business on [\u0097].\n\nThe GreenSky board, acting upon the unanimous\nrecommendation\nof the GreenSky special committee recommends\nthat holders of GreenSky common stock vote\n\u0093FOR\u0094 the GreenSky merger proposal, \u0093FOR\u0094 the\nnon-binding compensation proposal and\n\u0093FOR\u0094 the adjournment proposal.\n\nComparison of Equityholder Rights (Page 141)\n\nGreenSky stockholders and holders of Common\nUnits will have different rights once they\nbecome GS Group stockholders due to\ndifferences between\nthe organizational documents of GS Group,\nGreenSky and GreenSky Holdings. These\ndifferences are described in more detail\nunder the section entitled \u0093Comparison of\nEquityholder Rights\u0094 beginning on page 141 of\nthis proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nRisk Factors (Page 30)\n\nYou should consider all the information\ncontained in or incorporated by reference\ninto this proxy statement/prospectus in\ndeciding how to vote\nfor the proposals presented in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.

These comparisons may not provide\nmeaningful information to GreenSky\nstockholders in determining whether to approve\nthe merger agreement. GreenSky stockholders\nare urged to obtain current market quotations\nfor shares of GS Group common stock and\nGreenSky Class A common stock and to review\ncarefully the other information contained in\nthis proxy statement/prospectus or\nincorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement/prospectus in considering whether to\napprove the merger agreement. Implied per\nshare value of merger consideration is\ncalculated by multiplying the per share price\nof each share of GS Group common stock by the\nexchange ratio and rounding up or down to the\nnearest cent. The market prices of GS Group\ncommon stock and GreenSky Class A common stock\nhave fluctuated since the execution of the\nmerger agreement and will continue to\nfluctuate between the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus and the date of\nconsummation of the mergers. Because the\nexchange ratio is fixed and the market price\nof GS Group common stock has fluctuated and\nwill continue to fluctuate, holders of\nGreenSky Class A common stock and holders of\nCommon Units cannot be certain, at the time\nthey vote to approve the mergers, of the\nmarket value of the merger consideration they\nwill receive in the mergers. Accordingly,\nGreenSky Class A stockholders and holders of\nCommon Units are advised to obtain current\nmarket quotations for shares of GS Group\ncommon stock and shares of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock in deciding whether to vote for\napproval and adoption of the merger agreement.\nNo assurance can be given concerning the\nmarket prices of GreenSky Class A common stock\nor GS Group common stock before or after the\neffective date.

Additional risks and\nuncertainties, if they materialize, not\npresently known to GS Group or GreenSky or\nthat are not currently believed to be\nimportant to you, also may adversely affect\nthe mergers.\n\nIn addition, the businesses of GS Group,\nGreenSky and their respective subsidiaries are\nsubject to numerous risks and uncertainties,\nincluding the risks and uncertainties\ndescribed in GS Group\u0092s and GreenSky\u0092s\nrespective Annual Reports on Form 10-Kfor the\nfiscal year ended December31, 2020. The\nQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Qand Current\nReports on Form 8-Kthat have been filed by GS\nGroup and GreenSky with the SEC since GS\nGroup\u0092s and GreenSky\u0092s respective Annual\nReports were filed, or that may be filed with\nthe SEC after the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, may also include\ndescriptions of additional risks and\nuncertainties. Each such report is or will be\nincorporated by reference in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. See the section entitled\n\u0093Where You Can Find More Information\u0094\nbeginning on page163 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nRisks Relating to the Mergers\n\nBecause the exchange ratio is fixed and the\nmarket price of GS Group common stock has\nfluctuated and will continue to fluctuate,\nholders of GreenSky Class A common stock and\nholders of Common Units cannot be certain, at\nthe time they vote to approve the mergers, of\nthe market value of the merger consideration\nthey will receive in the mergers.\n\nUpon the consummation of the mergers, each (i)\nshare of GreenSky Class A common stock issued\nand outstanding immediately prior to the\ncompany merger, except for shares of GreenSky\nClass A common stock owned by GreenSky as\ntreasury shares or held by GS Group, GS Bank,\nMerger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 (in each case,\nnot held on behalf of third parties, including\nin a fiduciary,\ncustodial, nominee or similar capacity) and\n(ii) Common Unit issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Holdings merger,\nexcept for Common Units owned by GreenSky,\nwill, in each case, be canceled and converted\ninto the right to receive\n0.03 shares of GS Group common stock.\n\nThere will be a time lapse between each of the\ndate of this proxy statement/prospectus, the\ndate on\nwhich GreenSky stockholders vote to adopt the\nmerger agreement and thereby approve the\nmergers at the GreenSky special meeting and\nthe date on which the holders of GreenSky\nClass A common stock and holders of Common\nUnits entitled to receive\nshares of GS Group common stock actually\nreceive such shares. Changes in prices of GS\nGroup common stock prior to the consummation\nof the mergers will affect the merger\nconsideration that holders of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock and holders of\nCommon Units will receive upon the\nconsummation of the mergers. Stock price\nchanges may result from a variety of factors,\nincluding general market and economic\nconditions, impacts and disruptions resulting\nfrom the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, changes in GS Group\u0092s\nbusinesses, operations and prospects and\nregulatory considerations, and other factors\nbeyond the control of GS Group, including\nthose described under this\n\u0093Risk Factors\u0094 heading. Many of these factors\nare outside of the control of GS Group and\nGreenSky. Consequently, at the time GreenSky\nstockholders must decide whether to adopt the\nmerger agreement, they will not know or be\nable to\ndetermine the actual market value of the\nshares of GS Group common stock they will\nreceive when the mergers are consummated,\nwhich will depend on the market value of\nshares of GS Group common stock on that date.\n\nThe market value of GS Group common stock has\nfluctuated and will continue to fluctuate\nduring these periods. For example, based on\nthe range\nof closing prices of GS Group common stock\nduring the period from September 14, 2021, the\nlast full day of trading day before the date\nof the public announcement of the merger\nagreement, through [\u0097], the last practicable\ndate before the\ndate of this proxy statement/prospectus, the\nexchange ratio of 0.03 represented a market\nvalue per share of GreenSky Class A common\nstock ranging from a\n\n-30-\n\nlow of $[\u0097] to a high of $[\u0097]. If the price of\nGS Group common stock declines between the\ndate the merger agreement was signed and the\ndate of the special meeting and the\nconsummation\nof the mergers, including for any of the\nreasons described above, holders of GreenSky\nClass A common stock and holders of Common\nUnits will receive shares of GS Group common\nstock that have a market value upon the\nconsummation of the mergers\nthat is less than the market value of such\nshares calculated pursuant to the exchange\nratio on the date the merger agreement was\nsigned or on the date of the special meeting,\nrespectively.\n\nTherefore, since the number of shares of GS\nGroup common stock to be issued per share of\nGreenSky Class A common stock and per Common\nUnit is fixed, holders of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock and holders of Common Units\ncannot be sure of the market value of the\nmerger consideration they will receive upon\nthe consummation of the mergers. You should\nobtain current market\nquotations for shares of GS Group common stock\n(traded on the NYSE under the trading symbol\n\u0093GS\u0094) and for shares of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock (traded on NASDAQ under the\ntrading symbol \u0093GSKY\u0094).\n\nThe market price for GS Group common stock may\nbe affected by factors different from those\nthat historically have affected GreenSky.\n\nUpon the consummation of the mergers, holders\nof shares of GreenSky Class A common stock and\nholders of Common Units will receive as the\nmerger consideration shares of GS Group common\nstock. GS Group\u0092s businesses differ from that\nof GreenSky. GS Group is a global financial\ninstitution with greater than $1 trillion in\nassets that delivers a broad range of\nfinancial services\nacross investment banking, securities,\ninvestment management and consumer banking to\na large and diversified client base, while\nGreenSky is a technology company that provides\npoint of sale financing solutions for a much\nnarrower customer base in a\nmore limited geographical area than the\ncustomer base and geographic area served by GS\nGroup. Accordingly, the results of operations\nof GS Group will be affected by some factors\nthat are different from those currently\naffecting the results of\noperations of GreenSky. Further, as a bank\nholding company and a financial holding\ncompany, GS Group is subject to different and,\nin many cases, more onerous regulations than\nGreenSky. For a discussion of the businesses\nof GS Group and GreenSky and\nof some important factors to consider in\nconnection with those businesses, see the\nsection entitled \u0093The Parties to the Mergers\u0094\nbeginning on page 39 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus and the documents\nincorporated by\nreference referred to under the section\nentitled \u0093Where You Can Find More Information\u0094\nbeginning on page 163 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, including, in\nparticular, in the section entitled \u0093Risk\nFactors\u0094 in GS\nGroup\u0092s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2020.\n\nGreenSky stockholders will have a reduced\nownership and voting interest in GS Group\nafter the consummation of the mergers and will\nexercise less influence over management.\n\nThe mergers will result in GreenSky\nstockholders having an ownership stake in GS\nGroup that is significantly smaller than their\ncurrent\nownership stake in GreenSky. Currently,\nGreenSky\u0092s stockholders have the right to vote\nin the election of the board of directors of\nGreenSky and the power to approve or reject\nany matters requiring stockholder approval\nunder Delaware law, the\nGreenSky charter and/or the GreenSky bylaws.\nUpon the consummation of the mergers, each\nGreenSky Class A stockholder and holder of\nCommon Units who receives shares of GS Group\ncommon stock will become a stockholder of GS\nGroup with a percentage\nownership of GS Group attributable to the\nformer ownership of GreenSky common stock or\nCommon Units that is significantly smaller\nthan their current percentage ownership of\nGreenSky or GreenSky Holdings, respectively.\nFollowing the consummation of\nthe company merger, based on the number of\nshares of GS Group common stock outstanding as\nof [\u0097], the latest practicable date before the\ndate of this proxy statement/prospectus,\nformer GreenSky stockholders will own\napproximately [\u0097]% of\nthe outstanding shares of GS Group common\nstock, without giving effect to any shares of\nGS Group common stock held by GreenSky\nstockholders prior to the mergers. Because of\nthis, GreenSky stockholders would exercise\nsignificantly less influence over\nGS Group after the mergers relative to their\ninfluence over GreenSky prior to the mergers,\nand thus would have a less significant impact\non the approval or rejection of future GS\nGroup proposals submitted to a stockholder\nvote.\n\n-31-\n\nGS Group may be unable to successfully\nintegrate GreenSky\u0092s operations and may not\nrealize the anticipated benefits of acquiring\nGreenSky.\n\nGS Group and GreenSky have operated and, until\nthe consummation of the mergers, will\ncontinue to operate, independently. The\nsuccess of the mergers, including anticipated\nbenefits and cost savings, will depend, in\npart, on GS Group\u0092s ability to successfully\nintegrate GreenSky\u0092s operations in a manner\nthat results in\nvarious benefits, including, among other\nthings, expanded offerings in the consumer\nbanking space, an improved technology platform\nand digital product suite and broader\noperating efficiencies that will strengthen GS\nGroup\u0092s ability to meet the\nfinancial needs of new clients, customers,\nbusiness partners and consumers without\nmaterially disrupting existing client\nrelationships or resulting in decreased\nrevenues due to loss of clients. The process\nof integrating operations could result in a\nloss of key personnel or cause an interruption\nof, or loss of momentum in, the activities of\none or more of GS Group\u0092s businesses or\ninconsistencies in standards, controls,\nprocedures and policies that adversely affect\nthe ability of GS Group\nto maintain relationships with clients and\nemployees. The diversion of management\u0092s\nattention and any delays or difficulties\nencountered in connection with the mergers and\nthe integration of GreenSky\u0092s operations could\nhave an adverse\neffect on the business, financial condition,\noperating results and prospects of GS Group\nafter the mergers.\n\nIf GS Group experiences\ndifficulties in the integration process,\nincluding those listed above, GS Group may\nfail to realize the anticipated benefits of\nthe mergers in a timely manner, or at all.\nFailure to achieve these anticipated benefits\ncould result in increased costs,\ndecreases in the amount of expected revenues\nand diversion of management\u0092s time and energy\nand could have an adverse effect on GS Group\u0092s\nbusiness, financial condition, operating\nresults and prospects. In particular, the\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may make it\nmore costly or more difficult for GS Group to\neffect the integration of GreenSky into its\ncurrent operations, which, in turn, may make\nit more difficult for GS Group to realize\nanticipated benefits or cost savings in the\namounts estimated or in the time frame\ncontemplated or at all.\n\nAmong the factors considered\nby the boards of directors of GS Group and\nGreenSky in connection with their respective\napprovals of the merger agreement were the\nbenefits that could result from the mergers.\nWe cannot give any assurance that these\nbenefits will be realized within\na timely manner, or at all.\n\nThe merger agreement limits GreenSky\u0092s ability\nto pursue alternatives to the mergers and\nincludes provisions that could discourage a\npotential competing acquirer of GreenSky or\ncould result in any competing proposal being\nat a lower price than it might otherwise be.\n\nThe merger agreement contains \u0093no shop\u0094\ncovenants that prohibit GreenSky from\nsoliciting or, subject to certain exceptions\nrelating\nto the exercise of fiduciary duties by the\nGreenSky board, entering into discussions with\nany third party regarding, any acquisition\nproposal or offers for competing transactions.\nGreenSky may also be required to pay GS Group\na termination fee of\n$75 million in certain circumstances involving\na termination of the merger agreement and\nacquisition proposals for competing\ntransactions. GreenSky does not have the right\nto terminate the merger agreement to accept an\nalternative acquisition\nproposal. Accordingly, notwithstanding a\nchange in recommendation by the GreenSky\nboard, unless GS Group terminates the merger\nagreement following such change in\nrecommendation or the merger agreement is\notherwise validly terminated, GreenSky will\nstill be required to convene the special\nmeeting and submit the GreenSky merger\nproposal to the GreenSky stockholders for\napproval. See the sections entitled \u0093The\nMerger Agreement\u0097Termination of the Merger\nAgreement\u0094 and\n\u0093The Merger Agreement\u0097Termination Fee\u0094\nbeginning on pages 121 and 122, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, on\nSeptember 14, 2021, concurrently with the\nexecution of the merger agreement and as a\ncondition to GS Group\u0092s and GS Bank\u0092s entry\ninto the merger agreement, GS Group and GS\nBank entered into a voting agreement with\nDavid Zalik,\nChairman of the GreenSky board and GreenSky\u0092s\nChief Executive Officer, and certain of his\naffiliates, who as of September 30, 2021,\ncollectively and in the aggregate, held voting\npower over approximately 56% of the\noutstanding GreenSky\ncommon stock, which shares held by Mr. Zalik\nand certain of his affiliates we refer to as\nthe \u0093subject shares.\u0094 Pursuant to the voting\nagreement, among other things, each such\nstockholder agreed to vote all of his or its\nsubject\nshares in favor of the approval of the merger\nagreement\n\n-32-\n\nand the transactions contemplated thereby.\nHowever, in the event of an \u0093adverse\nrecommendation change\u0094 (as defined in the\nsection entitled \u0093 The Merger\nAgreement\u0097Solicitation; Change in\nRecommendation\u0094, beginning on page 112 of this\nproxy statement/prospectus) by the GreenSky\nboard, the aggregate number of shares of\nGreenSky common stock required to be voted in\nfavor of the approval of the merger agreement\nand the transactions contemplated thereby will\nbe reduced to the aggregate number of shares\nrepresenting 35% of the total voting power of\nGreenSky common stock, and each such\nstockholder\u0092s obligation to vote its subject\nshares in favor of the approval of the merger\nagreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby will be reduced by its pro rata\nportion of the excess subject shares. These\nprovisions could discourage a potential\ncompeting acquirer that might have an interest\nin acquiring all or a significant part of\nGreenSky from considering or proposing such an\nacquisition, even if it were prepared to pay\nconsideration with a higher per share cash or\nmarket value than that market value proposed\nto be received in the mergers, or might result\nin a potential competing acquirer proposing to\npay a lower price than it might otherwise have\nproposed to pay because of the added expense\nof the termination fee that may become payable\nin specified circumstances under the merger\nagreement. The merger agreement may be\nterminated in accordance with its terms and\nthe mergers may not be completed. The merger\nagreement is subject to a number of conditions\nwhich must be fulfilled in order to complete\nthe mergers, including, among others: the\napproval of the GreenSky merger proposal, the\nreceipt of required regulatory approvals and\nexpiration or termination of all statutory\nwaiting periods in respect thereof (as further\ndescribed in the section entitled \u0093 The\nMergers\u0097Regulatory Approvals\u0094 beginning on\npage 100 of this proxy statement/prospectus);\nthe accuracy of representations and warranties\nunder the merger agreement (subject to the\nmateriality standards set forth in the merger\nagreement); GS Group\u0092s and GreenSky\u0092s\nperformance of their respective obligations\nunder the merger agreement in all material\nrespects; the effectiveness of this\nregistration statement; and the tax receivable\nagreement, as amended by the tax receivable\nagreement amendment, not having been further\namended and being in full force and effect.\nNeither GS Group nor GreenSky can provide\nassurance that the conditions to the closing\nof the mergers will be satisfied or waived,\nand accordingly, that the mergers will be\ncompleted on the terms or timeline that the\nparties anticipate, or at all. If any\ncondition to the mergers is not satisfied, it\ncould delay or prevent the mergers from\noccurring, which could negatively impact the\nprice of GreenSky common stock or GS Group\ncommon stock and the parties\u0092 business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and\ngrowth prospects. In addition, if the mergers\nare not completed by April 15, 2022 (which we\nrefer to as the \u0093outside date\u0094), either GS\nGroup or GreenSky may choose not to proceed\nwith the mergers, and the parties can mutually\ndecide to terminate the merger agreement at\nany time, before or after GreenSky stockholder\napproval of the GreenSky merger proposal. In\naddition to the above risks, GS Group and\nGreenSky may elect to terminate the merger\nagreement in certain other limited\ncircumstances. See the section entitled \u0093 The\nMerger Agreement\u0097Termination of the Merger\nAgreement\u0094 beginning on page 121 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus for a description of\nthese circumstances. If the merger agreement\nis terminated under certain circumstances,\nGreenSky may be required to pay a termination\nfee of $75 million to GS Group. See the\nsection entitled \u0093 The Merger\nAgreement\u0097Termination Fee\u0094 beginning on page\n123 of this proxy statement/prospectus for a\nfuller description of these circumstances.\nFailure to complete the mergers could\nnegatively impact the stock price and the\nfuture business and financial results of\nGreenSky. If the mergers are not completed for\nany reason, including as a result of GreenSky\nstockholders declining to adopt the merger\nagreement, the ongoing business of GreenSky\nmay be adversely affected and, without\nrealizing any of the benefits of having\ncompleted the mergers, GreenSky would be\nsubject to a number of risks, including the\nfollowing:\n                                              \n      GreenSky may experience negative        \n      reactions from the financial markets,   \n      including negative impacts on its       \n      stock                                   \n      price;                                  \n                                              \n-33-\n                                              \n      GreenSky may experience negative        \n      reactions from its regulators,          \n      merchant partners, sponsors of          \n      merchants, bank                         \n      partners, other funding sources or      \n      purchasers of receivables related to,   \n      or economic participations in, loans    \n      originated by bank partners,            \n      customers, vendors, and employees;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      the merger agreement imposes certain    \n      restrictions on the conduct of          \n      GreenSky\u0092s business prior to completion  \n      of the mergers, which restrictions may  \n      prevent GreenSky from taking certain    \n      actions or otherwise pursuing business  \n      opportunities during the pendency of    \n      the mergers that GreenSky would have    \n      taken or pursued had these              \n      restrictions not been in effect;        \n                                              \n                                              \n      GreenSky will have incurred             \n      substantial expenses and will be        \n      required to pay these expenses and      \n      other costs it                          \n      will have incurred relating to the      \n      mergers, whether or not the mergers     \n      are consummated; and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      matters relating to the mergers         \n      (including integration planning) will   \n      require substantial commitments of      \n      time and                                \n      resources by GreenSky management,       \n      which would otherwise have been         \n      devoted to day-to-day operations and    \n      other opportunities that may have been  \n      beneficial to GreenSky as               \n      an independent company.                 \n                                              \nIn addition to the above risks, if the merger\nagreement is terminated and the GreenSky board\nseeks another merger or business combination,\nGreenSky stockholders cannot be certain that\nGreenSky will be able to find a party willing\nto offer equivalent or more attractive\nconsideration than the consideration GS Group\nhas agreed to provide in the mergers. If the\nmerger agreement is terminated under certain\ncircumstances, GreenSky may be required to pay\na termination fee of $75 million to GS Group.\nSee the section entitled \u0093 The Merger\nAgreement\u0097Termination Fee\u0094 beginning on page\n123 of this proxy statement/prospectus. The\nCOVID-19 pandemic and events related to it may\ndelay or adversely affect the completion of\nthe mergers. The COVID-19pandemic and events\nrelated to it may adversely affect the\nbusiness, financial condition and results of\noperations of GS Group and GreenSky. If the\nbusinesses or operations of GS Group or\nGreenSky are disrupted as a result of the\nCOVID-19pandemic and events related to it,\nefforts to complete the mergers and integrate\nthe businesses of GS Group and GreenSky may be\ndelayed and adversely affected. Additional\ntime may be required to obtain the requisite\nregulatory approvals, and the bank regulatory\nand other governmental authorities may impose\nadditional requirements on GS Group and\nGreenSky that must be satisfied prior to\ncompletion of the mergers, which could delay\nor adversely affect the completion of the\nmergers. Regulatory approvals may not be\nreceived, may take longer than expected or may\nimpose conditions that are not presently\nanticipated or cannot be met. Before the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, including the mergers, may be\ncompleted, various approvals must be obtained\nfrom bank regulators and other governmental\nauthorities as described in the section\nentitled \u0093 The Merger\u0097Regulatory Approvals\u0094\nbeginning on page 100 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. In determining whether\nto grant these approvals, such regulators will\nconsider a variety of factors, including the\nregulatory standing of each party. These\napprovals could be delayed or not obtained at\nall, including due to: an adverse development\nin either party\u0092s regulatory standing, or any\nother factors considered by regulators in\ngranting such approvals; governmental,\npolitical or community group inquiries,\ninvestigations or opposition; changes in\nlegislation or the political environment\ngenerally; or impacts and disruptions\nresulting from the COVID-19pandemic. These\ngovernmental entities may impose conditions,\nlimitations or costs or place restrictions on\nthe conduct of GS Group after the closing as a\ncondition to the granting of such approvals or\nrequire changes to the terms of the company\nmerger or the Holdings merger. Such conditions\nor changes and the process of obtaining\nregulatory approvals could have the effect of\ndelaying completion of the mergers or of\nimposing additional costs or limitations on GS\nGroup following the mergers, any of which\nmight have an adverse effect on GS Group\nfollowing the mergers. -34-\n\nGreenSky will be subject to business\nuncertainties and contractual restrictions\nwhile the mergers are pending, which could\nadversely affect its business.\n\nUncertainty about the effect of the mergers on\nemployees and customers may\nhave an adverse effect on GreenSky and,\nconsequently, GS Group following the\nconsummation of the mergers. These\nuncertainties may impair GreenSky\u0092s ability to\nattract, retain and motivate key personnel\nuntil the mergers are consummated and for\na period of time thereafter, and could cause\ncustomers and others that deal with GreenSky\nto seek to change their existing business\nrelationships with GreenSky. Employee\nretention at GreenSky may be particularly\nchallenging during the pendency of\nthe mergers, as employees may experience\nuncertainty about their roles with GS Group\nand its affiliates following the mergers. In\naddition, the merger agreement restricts\nGreenSky from making certain acquisitions and\ntaking other specified actions\nwithout the consent of GS Group, and generally\nrequires GreenSky to continue its operations\nin the ordinary course, until the mergers\nclose. These restrictions may prevent GreenSky\nfrom pursuing attractive business\nopportunities that may arise prior\nto the completion of the mergers. Please see\nthe section entitled \u0093The Merger\nAgreement\u0097Conduct of Businesses\u0094 beginning on\npage 110 of this proxy statement/prospectus\nfor a description of the restrictive covenants\nto\nwhich GreenSky is subject.\n\nDirectors and executive officers of GreenSky\nmay have interests in the mergers that are\ndifferent from, or in addition to, the\ninterests of GreenSky stockholders.\n\nGreenSky stockholders should be aware that\nsome of GreenSky\u0092s directors and\nexecutive officers may have interests in the\nmergers and have arrangements that are\ndifferent from, or in addition to, those of\nGreenSky stockholders generally. The members\nof the GreenSky board and the members of the\nGreenSky special committee were\naware of and considered these interests in\nreaching the determination, in the case of the\nGreenSky special committee, to recommend the\nmergers to the GreenSky board and, in the case\nof the GreenSky board, to approve and adopt\nthe merger agreement\nand other related agreements and recommend to\nGreenSky stockholders that they vote in favor\nof the GreenSky merger proposal. For\nadditional information, see \u0093The\nMergers\u0097Interests of GreenSky\u0092s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Mergers\u0094 beginning\non page 94 of this proxy statement/prospectus.\n\nShares of GS Group common stock to be received\nby holders of GreenSky Class A common stock\nand holders of Common Units as a result of the\nmergers will have rights different from the\nshares of GreenSky Class A common stock and\nCommon Units, respectively.\n\nUpon the consummation of the mergers, the\nrights of former GreenSky stockholders and\nformer holders of Common Units will be\ngoverned by the GS\nGroup charter and the GS Group by-laws. Even\nthough both GS Group and GreenSky are\nincorporated under the laws of the State of\nDelaware, the rights afforded to GS Group\nstockholders differ from the rights\nafforded to GreenSky stockholders and may be\nless favorable than their current rights as\nGreenSky stockholders. Further, the rights\nassociated with GS Group common stock are\ndifferent from the rights associated with the\nCommon Units and the terms of\nGeorgia law applicable to limited liability\ncompanies, which currently governs the rights\nof holders of Common Units and may be less\nfavorable than their current rights as holders\nof Common Units. Please see the section\nentitled \u0093Comparison of Equityholder Rights\u0094\nbeginning on page 141 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus for a discussion of the\ndifferent rights associated with GS Group\ncommon stock.\n\nGS Group will incur certain transaction and\nmerger-related costs in connection with the\nmergers.\n\nEach of GS Group and GreenSky has incurred and\nwill incur certain expenses in connection with\nthe negotiation and completion of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, as well as the costs and expenses\nof filing, printing and mailing this proxy\nstatement/prospectus and other fees paid to\nthe SEC in connection with the mergers.\n\nGS Group expects to continue to incur a number\nof non-recurring costs associated with\ncompleting the\nmergers, combining the operations of the two\ncompanies and achieving desired synergies. The\nsubstantial\n\n-35-\n\nmajority of non-recurring expenses will be\ncomprised of transaction costs related to the\nmergers and include, but are not limited to,\nfees paid to legal,\nfinancial and accounting advisors, severance\nand benefit, technology integration costs and\nfiling fees.\n\nGS Group also will incur\ntransaction fees and costs related to\nformulating and implementing integration\nplans, including facilities and systems\nconsolidation costs and employment-related\ncosts. GS Group continues to assess the\nmagnitude of these costs, and additional\nunanticipated costs may be incurred in the\nmergers and the integration of the two\ncompanies\u0092 businesses. Although GS Group\nexpects that the elimination of duplicative\ncosts, as well as the realization of other\nefficiencies related to the\nintegration of the businesses, should allow GS\nGroup to offset integration-related costs over\ntime, this net benefit may not be achieved in\nthe near term, or at all. The aggregate amount\nand timing of such charges are uncertain at\npresent. See the\nrisk factor entitled \u0093GS Group may be unable\nto successfully integrate GreenSky\u0092s\noperations and may not realize the anticipated\nbenefits of acquiring GreenSky\u0094 above.\n\nIf it is determined the company merger does\nnot qualify as a tax-free\u0093reorganization\u0094 for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders\nof GreenSky Class A common stock will\ngenerally recognize capital gain or loss as a\nresult of the company merger.\n\nAs further described below in \u0093Material United\nStates Federal Income Tax Consequences\u0094\nbeginning on page 124 of this\nproxy statement/prospectus, it is the opinion\nof Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and Sullivan &\nCromwell LLP that the company merger should\nqualify as a tax-free \u0093reorganization\u0094 within\nthe meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.\nHowever, such opinions are not binding on the\nIRS or any court, nor is the receipt of\nfurther opinions a condition to the closing of\nthe mergers. If it is determined the company\nmerger does not qualify\nas a tax-free \u0093reorganization\u0094, the company\nmerger would be a taxable transaction to\nGreenSky stockholders for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. In that case, a U.S. holder (as\ndefined below in\nthe section entitled \u0093Material United States\nFederal Income Tax Consequences\u0094)would\ngenerally recognize capital gain or loss\nmeasured by reference to the fair market value\nof GS Group common stock received in exchange\nfor\nsuch U.S. holder\u0092s GreenSky Class A common\nstock. For more information about the tax\nconsequences related to the company merger,\nsee the section entitled \u0093Material United\nStates Federal Income Tax Consequences\u0097Tax\nConsequences of the Company Merger\u0094 beginning\non page 126 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nCompletion of the mergers may trigger change\nin control or other provisions in certain\nagreements to which GreenSky or one of its\nsubsidiaries is a party.\n\nThe completion of\nthe mergers may trigger \u0093change in control\u0094\nand other provisions in certain agreements to\nwhich GreenSky or one of its subsidiaries is a\nparty. If GS Group and GreenSky are unable to\nnegotiate waivers of those provisions, the\ncounterparties may exercise their rights and\nremedies under the agreements, potentially\nterminating the agreements or seeking monetary\ndamages or equitable remedies. Even if GS\nGroup and GreenSky are able to negotiate\nconsents or waivers, the\ncounterparties may require a fee for such\nwaivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements\non terms less favorable to GreenSky. There is\nno assurance that such counterparties will not\nexercise their rights under the agreements,\nincluding termination\nrights where available, that the exercise of\nany such rights will not result in a material\nadverse effect or that any modifications of\nsuch agreements will not result in a material\nadverse effect.\n\nGS Group or GreenSky may waive one or more of\nthe closing conditions without GreenSky re-\nsolicitingGreenSky stockholder approval.\n\nCertain conditions to GS Group\u0092s and\nGreenSky\u0092s obligations, respectively, to\ncomplete the mergers\nmay be waived, in whole or in part, to the\nextent legally permissible, either\nunilaterally by such party or by agreement of\nGS Group and GreenSky. In the event of any\nsuch waiver, the parties will have the\ndiscretion to complete the mergers without\nseeking further approval of GreenSky\nstockholders.\n\n-36-\n\nThe opinions delivered by J.P. Morgan to the\nGreenSky board and Piper Sandler to the\nGreenSky special committee have not been, and\nare not expected to be, updated to reflect any\nchanges in circumstances that may have\noccurred since the date of the opinions.\n\nThe opinion rendered by J.P. Morgan, financial\nadvisor to GreenSky, to the GreenSky board on\nSeptember 14, 2021, and the opinion rendered\nby Piper Sandler, financial advisor to the\nGreenSky special committee, to the GreenSky\nspecial committee on September 14, 2021, were\neach based upon such information available to\nJ.P.

The opinions do not\nreflect any events or changes that may have\noccurred or that otherwise have come to such\nfinancial advisors after the date on which\nsuch opinions were delivered, including\nchanges to the business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects\nof GS Group or GreenSky, changes in business,\nfinancial, economic, market and other\nconditions, or other events or changes which\nmay be beyond the control of GS Group and\nGreenSky, including the impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic after September 14,\n2021 and other risks and uncertainties. Any\nsuch changes may alter the relative value of\nGS Group or GreenSky or the prices at which\nshares of GS Group common\nstock or GreenSky Class A common stock may\ntrade prior to the time the mergers are\ncompleted. The opinions do not speak as of the\ndate the mergers will be completed or as of\nany date other than the date of such opinions,\nand the financial\nadvisors did not assume any obligation to\nupdate their respective opinion. For more\ninformation about the respective opinions\ndelivered by J.P. Morgan and Piper Sandler,\nsee \u0093The Merger\u0097Opinion of J.P. Morgan,\nGreenSky\u0092s Financial Advisor\u0094 beginning on\npage 76, \u0093The Merger\u0097Opinion of Piper Sandler,\nGreenSky Special Committee\u0092s Financial\nAdvisor\u0094 beginning on page 82, Annex Band\nAnnex Cto this proxy statement/prospectus.\n\nIssuance of shares of GS Group common stock in\nconnection with the mergers may adversely\naffect the market price of GS Group common\nstock.\n\nIn connection with the payment of the merger\nconsideration, GS Group expects to issue\napproximately [\u0097] shares of GS Group common\nstock to\nthe holders of GreenSky Class A common stock\nand holders of Common Units. The issuance of\nthese new shares of GS Group common stock may\nresult in fluctuations in the market price of\nGS Group common stock, including a stock price\ndecrease.\n\nNeither GreenSky stockholders nor holders of\nCommon Units will have dissenters\u0092 rights or\nappraisal rights in the mergers.\n\nAppraisal rights (also known as dissenters\u0092\nrights) are statutory rights that, if\napplicable under law, enable stockholders to\ndissent\nfrom an extraordinary transaction, such as a\nmerger, and to demand that the corporation pay\nthe fair value for their shares as determined\nby a court in a judicial proceeding instead of\nreceiving the consideration offered to\nstockholders in\nconnection with the extraordinary transaction.\n\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, holders of\nGreenSky Class A common stock will not\nbe entitled to appraisal rights in connection\nwith the company merger if, on the record date\nof the GreenSky special meeting, shares of\nGreenSky Class A common stock are listed on a\nnational securities exchange or held of record\nby more than\ntwo thousand (2,000) stockholders, and holders\nof GreenSky Class A common stock are not\nrequired to accept as consideration for their\nshares anything other than the shares of GS\nGroup listed on a national securities exchange\nor held of record\nby more than two thousand (2,000)\nstockholders, cash paid in lieu of fractional\nshares or any combination of the foregoing.\nHolders of GreenSky Class A common stock will\nreceive shares of GS Group common stock as\nconsideration in the merger,\nwhich shares are currently listed on NYSE, and\nare expected to continue to be so listed at\nthe effective time. Accordingly, the holders\nof GreenSky Class A common stock are not\nentitled to any appraisal rights in connection\nwith the company\nmerger.\n\nIn addition, since the Holdings merger will\noccur immediately prior to the company merger,\nall shares of GreenSky Class B\ncommon stock will be automatically deemed\ntransferred to GreenSky and canceled and cease\nto exist at the effective time of the Holdings\nmerger, which is prior to the effective time\nof the company merger. Accordingly, no shares\nof GreenSky\nClass B common stock will be outstanding at\nthe effective time of the\n\n-37-\n\ncompany merger and the holders of GreenSky\nClass B common stock as of immediately prior\nto the Holdings merger effective time will not\nbe entitled to any appraisal rights in\nconnection with\nthe company merger.\n\nUnder Section 14-11-1002 of the\nGLLCA, a record member of a limited liability\ncompany is entitled, in certain circumstances,\nto dissent from, and obtain payment of the\nfair value of his or her membership interest\nin the event of consummation of a plan of\nmerger, unless otherwise\nprovided by the company\u0092s articles of\norganization or written operating agreement.\nSince the GreenSky Holdings operating\nagreement provides that holders of Common\nUnits are not entitled to dissenters\u0092 or\nappraisal rights, holders of Common\nUnits are not entitled to any appraisal rights\nin connection with the Holdings merger.\n\nSee \u0093The Merger\u0097No Appraisal or Dissenters\u0092\nRights\u0094 on page 100 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nStockholder litigation could prevent or delay\nthe completion of the mergers or otherwise\nnegatively impact the business and operations\nof GS Group and GreenSky.\n\nTransactions like the mergers are\nfrequently the subject of litigation or other\nlegal proceedings, including actions alleging\nthat either parties\u0092 board of directors\nbreached their respective duties to their\nstockholders by entering into a merger\nagreement, by failing to obtain\na greater value in a transaction for their\nstockholders or any other claims (contractual\nor otherwise) arising out of a merger or the\ntransactions related thereto. Stockholders of\nGS Group and/or GreenSky may file lawsuits\nagainst GreenSky, GS Group\nand/or the directors and officers of either\ncompany in connection with the mergers. One of\nthe conditions to the closing is that no\norder, injunction or decree issued by any\ncourt or governmental entity of competent\njurisdiction or other legal\nrestraint preventing the consummation of the\nmergers or any of the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement be in\neffect. If any plaintiff were successful in\nobtaining an injunction prohibiting GS Group\nor GreenSky from consummating\nthe mergers or any of the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, then\nsuch injunction may delay or prevent the\neffectiveness of the mergers and could result\nin significant costs to GS Group and/or\nGreenSky, including any cost\nassociated with the indemnification of\ndirectors and officers of each company. GS\nGroup and GreenSky may incur costs in\nconnection with the defense or settlement of\nany stockholder lawsuits filed in connection\nwith the mergers. Such litigation could\nhave an adverse effect on GS Group\u0092s or\nGreenSky\u0092s ability to consummate the mergers\nor on their respective financial condition,\nresults of operations and growth prospects,\nincluding through the possible diversion of\neither company\u0092s\nresources or distraction of key personnel.\n\nRisks Relating to GS Group\u0092s Business\n\nYou should read and consider risk factors\nspecific to GS Group\u0092s business.

This summary does not\npurport to be complete and may not contain\nall of the information about the mergers that\nis important to you. You are encouraged to\nread the merger agreement carefully and in its\nentirety. This section is not intended to\nprovide you with any factual information about\nGreenSky or GS Group.\nSuch information can be found elsewhere in\nthis proxy statement/prospectus and in the\npublic filings GreenSky and GS Group make with\nthe SEC that are incorporated by reference\ninto this document, as described in the\nsection entitled \u0093Where You Can Find More\nInformation\u0094 beginning on page 163 of this\nproxy statement/prospectus.\n\nBackground of the Transactions\n\nAs part of their ongoing review of GreenSky\u0092s\nbusiness, the GreenSky board and senior\nmanagement team periodically review and\nevaluate\nGreenSky\u0092s business and long-term strategy,\ncompetitive position, prospects and\nopportunities to increase stockholder value.\nThese reviews have included considering the\ncontinued execution of GreenSky\u0092s strategy as\na stand-alone company,\nchanges to GreenSky\u0092s funding model and\nrelationships with its bank funding partners\nand the possible sale of GreenSky to a third\nparty.\n\nThe GS Group board, together with GS Group\nmanagement, regularly considers and evaluates\npotential strategic opportunities, as well as\ndevelopments in GS Group\u0092s businesses, the\nfinancial markets, the financial services\nindustry, economic conditions and the\nregulatory environment, with the goal of\nenhancing value for GS Group\u0092s stockholders.\n\nOn July 29, 2019, the GreenSky board held an\nin-person meeting, together with members of\nsenior\nmanagement and representatives of J.P. Morgan\nand Financial Technology Partners LP (which we\nrefer to as \u0093FT Partners\u0094), financial advisors\nto GreenSky, and representatives of Cravath,\nSwaine & Moore LLP and Troutman Sanders\nPepper Hamilton LLP (which we refer to as\n\u0093Cravath\u0094 and \u0093Troutman Pepper\u0094 respectively),\noutside counsel to GreenSky, to discuss\nwhether it might make sense for the GreenSky\nboard to consider possible strategic\nalternatives that\nmay be available to GreenSky, including\npossible transactions involving a sale,\nmerger, investment or other similar\ntransaction. GreenSky and the GreenSky board\nhad selected J.P. Morgan and FT Partners as\nfinancial advisors given their familiarity\nwith GreenSky, their expertise and contacts in\nthe financial technology and financial\nservices industries and their expertise with\nrespect to advising companies in these types\nof strategic alternative reviews and in\nconnection with mergers and\nacquisitions transactions. In particular, J.P.\nMorgan and FT Partners had acted as a joint\nbookrunner and a financial advisor,\nrespectively, in connection with GreenSky\u0092s\ninitial public offering.\n\nAt the meeting, the representatives of Cravath\nreviewed with the GreenSky board their\nfiduciary duties under Delaware law, both\ngenerally and\nin the context of conducting a review of\nstrategic alternatives and any potential\ntransaction. In this discussion, the\nrepresentatives of Cravath reviewed with the\nGreenSky board considerations specific to\ncompanies with a controlling stockholder,\nas Mr. David Zalik, the founder and Chief\nExecutive Officer of GreenSky, held and\ncontinues to hold a controlling voting\ninterest in GreenSky. In particular, the\nrepresentatives of Cravath reviewed whether\nand when it might be advisable for the\nGreenSky board to form a special committee of\ndirectors and subject a transaction to a\n\u0093majority of the minority\u0094 stockholder vote in\ndifferent transaction scenarios. The GreenSky\nboard noted these considerations and\ndetermined that it\nwould revisit these considerations as the\nprocess evolved and at the appropriate time.\n\nAt the meeting, the representatives of J.P.\nMorgan\nand FT Partners also provided an overview of\nthe then-current market and economic backdrop,\nas well as certain financial information\nregarding GreenSky\u0092s performance and outlook\nrelative to its industry peers. The\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan\nand FT Partners discussed the potential merits\nof GreenSky seeking stable bank partner\nfunding and that volatility in GreenSky\u0092s\n\n-41-\n\nstock price likely did not engender market\nconfidence conducive to maintaining stable\nfunding. The representatives of J.P. Morgan\nand FT Partners reviewed potential strategic\nalternatives,\nincluding remaining independent, fundamentally\nchanging GreenSky\u0092s business model to\ndiversify its funding and a potential sale to\na strategic or financial buyer, as well as\npotential partners for a sale transaction.\n\nDuring the meeting, the GreenSky board and\nsenior management discussed the relative\nbenefits of different alternatives and\nconcluded that, due\nto the volatility of GreenSky\u0092s stock price,\nthe ongoing concern among investors regarding\nGreenSky\u0092s bank funding model and the\ncomplexity of GreenSky\u0092s operating model, it\nwould be in the best interests of GreenSky\nstockholders to\nconsider and evaluate strategic alternatives\nfocused on maximizing stockholder value. The\nGreenSky board authorized senior management,\nwith the assistance of its financial and legal\nadvisors, to commence a process to consider\nand evaluate all\nstrategic alternatives that might be available\nto GreenSky, and to potentially solicit\ninterest from third parties regarding a sale\ntransaction. The GreenSky board also concluded\nthat it would be optimal to publicly disclose\nthis decision so as to\npermit GreenSky to conduct a full survey of\nthe market.\n\nOn August 5, 2019, the GreenSky board executed\na unanimous written consent\nauthorizing the engagement of J.P. Morgan as\nfinancial advisor to GreenSky and the GreenSky\nboard in connection with its evaluation of\nstrategic alternatives. The GreenSky board did\nnot need to authorize the engagement of FT\nPartners in this regard,\nas FT Partners already had an existing\nengagement letter with GreenSky that was\napplicable to the strategic alternatives\nreview.\n\nOn\nAugust 6, 2019, GreenSky publicly announced\nthat it was evaluating strategic alternatives.\nThereafter, at the direction of the GreenSky\nboard, representatives of J.P. Morgan and FT\nPartners had preliminary discussions with\npotential acquirors\nof GreenSky, including GS Group.\n\nOn September 4, 2019, the GreenSky board held\nan in-person\nmeeting to discuss the GreenSky strategic\nalternatives review, including whether to\nlaunch a formal sale process for a potential\nacquisition of GreenSky. Members of GreenSky\nsenior management and representatives of J.P.\nMorgan, FT Partners, Cravath\nand Troutman Pepper were in attendance. The\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan and FT Partners\nreviewed different strategic alternatives\npotentially available to GreenSky, including a\npotential sale transaction, and initial\nfeedback from the preliminary\ndiscussions with potential acquirors,\nincluding the identities of such potential\nacquirors, that had occurred following the\npublic announcement of the strategic\nalternatives review. The representatives of\nJ.P. Morgan and FT Partners then\npresented their respective preliminary\nvaluation analyses with respect to GreenSky on\na stand-alone basis. After discussing the\nvarious strategic alternatives potentially\navailable to GreenSky, including a potential\nsale transaction, and the\npotential acquirors, the GreenSky board\nauthorized J.P. Morgan and FT Partners to\nlaunch a formal sale process for a potential\nacquisition of GreenSky and to continue\nsoliciting interest from the potential\nacquirors that had engaged in\npreliminary discussions with J.P. Morgan and\nFT Partners.\n\nAmong other things discussed at the meeting,\nthe GreenSky board discussed that\nit was possible that certain potential\nacquirors might request that Mr. Zalik (and\npotentially Mr. Robert Sheft, a director of\nGreenSky who, through a related entity, then\nheld approximately 12% of the outstanding\nequity of GreenSky) roll\nover a portion of their equity interests in a\ntransaction. In this discussion, Mr. Zalik\nsaid that he would be open to doing so if it\nwould be helpful to facilitate a transaction,\nbut that he would take direction from the\nGreenSky board on\nwhether, how and when to engage in any such\ndiscussions with potential acquirors. Also\nduring this discussion, the representatives of\nCravath and Troutman Pepper advised the\nGreenSky board that neither Mr. Zalik nor any\nmember of GreenSky\nmanagement should engage in any discussion\nregarding a rollover or post-transaction\nemployment with any potential acquirors until\nauthorized by the GreenSky board, other than\nMr. Zalik confirming that he would be open to\nsuch discussions at the\nappropriate time and when authorized by the\nGreenSky board. The GreenSky board expressed\nits view that this instruction was important\nbecause it wanted to ensure that Mr. Zalik\u0092s\ninterests were aligned with all GreenSky\nstockholders in\nobtaining the best value for the equity of\nGreenSky were a sale of GreenSky to occur. The\nGreenSky board also discussed that Mr. Zalik\n\n-42-\n\nindicating that he would be open to a rollover\nwould be helpful to the process because\ncertain buyers might not be willing to make a\nproposal without knowing that a rollover was\npossible.\nMr. Zalik stated that his goal was value\nmaximization for all GreenSky stockholders and\nthat he understood the instructions from the\nGreenSky board and would abide by them.\n\nIn August and September of 2019, GreenSky and\nits financial advisors solicited interest from\npotential acquirors for a sale of GreenSky.\nDuring the course of the process, 83 potential\nbuyers were contacted and 34 parties\n(including an affiliate of GS Group) executed\nnon-disclosure agreements and participated in\nthe sales process that was being\nundertaken. Among the executed non-disclosure\nagreements, all contained standstill\nagreements, 32 of which had time periods that\nexpired some time in 2020 and the remaining\ntwo of which expired upon\nGreenSky\u0092s entry into a definitive merger\nagreement.\n\nOn September 24, 2019, the GreenSky board held\nan in-person meeting, with representatives of\nJ.P. Morgan, FT Partners, Cravath and Troutman\nPepper also in attendance. During the meeting,\nthe GreenSky board discussed the status of the\n2019 sale process and provided\ndirection to senior management and to the\nfinancial and legal advisors with respect to\nthat process, including the establishment of\nan initial bid deadline at the end of October\n2019. Also during the meeting, the\nrepresentatives of Cravath and\nTroutman Pepper again discussed with the\nGreenSky board legal considerations regarding\nthe sale process, including matters related to\na potential rollover if there were bids\nreceived that contemplated a rollover by Mr.\nZalik (and potentially\nMr. Sheft). The representatives of Cravath and\nTroutman Pepper reviewed the step of creating\nan independent special committee of properly\nempowered and properly advised independent\ndirectors to address any conflicts of interest\nthat may be\nposed by such a rollover request, and also\nnoted that any such special committee would\nneed to be in place before GreenSky engaged in\nany substantive negotiations with any bidders\ncontemplating a rollover. The GreenSky board\nnoted the possibility\nthat one or more bids may include a rollover\nrequest and that it would need to form a\nspecial committee in such circumstance. At the\nmeeting, Mr. Zalik stated that he was abiding\nby the prior instructions from the GreenSky\nboard not to engage\nin any discussions regarding rollover or\nsimilar arrangements with any participants in\nthe process other than to indicate an openness\nto doing so.\n\nOn October 18, 2019, the GreenSky board met\ntelephonically, together with members of\nsenior management and representatives of J.P.\nMorgan, FT Partners, Cravath and Troutman\nPepper to receive an update on the sale\nprocess to date. At this meeting, the GreenSky\nboard discussed the tax receivable agreement\nand its potential financial impact on any\npotential acquisition\ntransaction. The GreenSky board discussed that\nit would be important to understand what\nassumptions potential bidders would be making\nwith respect to the tax receivable agreement,\nincluding providing bidders with information\non the financial impact\nof the tax receivable agreement so that\nbidders could make fully informed bids, and so\nthat the GreenSky board could evaluate bids\ncomparably. In this discussion, the\nrepresentatives of Cravath reviewed that tax\nreceivable agreements had been\ntreated in different ways in precedent\ntransactions, and that the GreenSky board may\nbe evaluating bids that proposed treating the\ntax receivable agreement differently. The\nfinancial and legal advisors reviewed with the\nGreenSky board that in\nsituations where less than the full amount of\nthe tax receivable agreement was paid out in a\npotential transaction more consideration would\nbe potentially available to be paid to\nGreenSky\u0092s public stockholders. In light of\nthe fact that all\nmembers of the GreenSky board other than Mr.\nArthur Bacci had direct or indirect financial\ninterests in the tax receivable agreement, the\nGreenSky board discussed that it would be\nnecessary that only Mr. Bacci have authority\nto make\ndecisions, on behalf of the GreenSky board,\nregarding the tax receivable agreement going\nforward, including seeking consent from the\ntax receivable agreement beneficiaries to\neffect any reduction of consideration payable\nto the tax receivable\nagreement beneficiaries, with the goal of\nseeking to increase the consideration that\nwould potentially be paid to GreenSky\u0092s public\nstockholders.\n\nOn October 31, 2019, GreenSky received four\nwritten non-binding proposals to acquire\nGreenSky,\nthree from financial sponsors (which we refer\nto as \u0093Financial Sponsor A\u0094 \u0093Financial Sponsor\nB\u0094 and \u0093Financial Sponsor C,\u0094 as applicable)\nand one from GS Group. Also on that date,\nGreenSky received one proposal from a\nfinancial sponsor to provide financing for a\npotential acquisition should another party be\ninterested in acquiring GreenSky, as well as a\nverbal proposal from a strategic acquiror.\n\n-43-\n\nOn November 6, 2019, the GreenSky board met\ntelephonically, together with members of\nsenior management and representatives of J.P.\nMorgan, FT Partners, Cravath and Troutman\nPepper, to review the proposals that had been\nreceived. The proposal from GS Group provided\nfor an all-cash acquisition\nof GreenSky at a range of $9.00 to $10.00 per\nshare of GreenSky Class A common stock. The\nproposal from GS Group did not include any\nassumptions regarding the treatment of the tax\nreceivable agreement. However, the\nrepresentatives of J.P.\nMorgan stated that representatives of GS Group\nverbally had indicated that GS Group was\nassuming that the tax receivable agreement\nwould be accelerated and paid out in a\ntransaction, but that GS Group had not\nprovided any information as to whether\nit had ascribed or assumed any specific value\nwith respect to such acceleration payment. The\nwritten proposals from the three financial\nsponsors were as follows: a proposal from\nFinancial Sponsor A of $10.00 in cash per\nshare of GreenSky\nClass A common stock, assuming a full payment\nof the tax receivable agreement in connection\nwith a transaction; a proposal from Financial\nSponsor B of $8.25 in cash per share of\nGreenSky Class A common stock, without\nspecifying any\nassumptions regarding the tax receivable\nagreement; and a proposal from Financial\nSponsor C of $8.00 in cash per share of\nGreenSky Class A common stock, assuming a\npartial payment of the tax receivable\nagreement to some tax receivable agreement\nbeneficiaries and a forfeiture of the tax\nreceivable agreement payments by those tax\nreceivable agreement beneficiaries that\nparticipated in a rollover in the transaction.\nThe representatives of J.P. Morgan also\nreviewed that the verbal indication\nfrom the strategic party that had not provided\na written proposal was at a range of $5.60 to\n$6.70 in cash per share of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock, assuming that the tax receivable\nagreement was paid out in full in connection\nwith a\ntransaction. The representatives of J.P.\nMorgan also reported that Financial Sponsor B\nhad stated that it could not execute on a\ntransaction by itself and would need to\nidentify one or more partners to be able to do\nso.\n\nThe GreenSky board discussed the proposals and\ndecided to advance GS Group, Financial Sponsor\nA and Financial Sponsor C to the next round of\nthe process. The GreenSky board determined not\nto continue discussions with (i) Financial\nSponsor B, taking note of its inability to\nexecute on a transaction by itself, (ii) the\nfinancial sponsor that had proposed acting as\na financing\nsource or (iii) the strategic party that had\nprovided the verbal indication at $5.60 to\n$6.70 per share of GreenSky Class A common\nstock, in order to focus on the three bidders\nthat had put forth the most firm proposals.\n\nMr. Zalik then proposed that the GreenSky\nboard consider, in light of its prior\ndiscussions, whether to formally establish a\nspecial\ncommittee of independent directors. The\nrepresentatives of Cravath reviewed with the\nGreenSky board that the purpose of the special\ncommittee would be to protect the interests of\nGreenSky\u0092s unaffiliated stockholders against\nany potential\nconflicts of interest that could arise with\nrespect to the controlling stockholder of\nGreenSky and any other members of the GreenSky\nboard regarding equity rollover in a potential\ntransaction. The representatives of Cravath\nalso stated that the\nspecial committee should delegate authority to\na sub-committee comprised solely of Mr. Bacci\nto consider, evaluate and recommend a course\nof action to the GreenSky board with respect\nto the treatment of\nthe tax receivable agreement in any potential\nacquisition of GreenSky. The GreenSky board\nthen authorized and created a special\ncommittee (which we refer to as the \u0093GreenSky\n2019 special committee\u0094) consisting of four\ndirectors of the\nGreenSky board who would not participate in\nany rollover in connection with a transaction\nand were not otherwise members of management\n(thereby excluding Mr. Zalik, Mr. Sheft and\nMr. Gerry Benjamin, who served as the Vice\nChairman of\nthe GreenSky board and the Chief\nAdministrative Officer of GreenSky) with full\nauthority to review, consider, evaluate,\nnegotiate, accept, reject and recommend any\npotential transaction in which one or more\nofficers, directors or other affiliates of\nGreenSky, including Mr. Zalik, may have an\ninterest that would be additional to and/or\ndifferent from the interests of GreenSky\u0092s\nunaffiliated stockholders. The GreenSky board\nalso authorized the GreenSky 2019 special\ncommittee to create a\nsub-committee comprised solely of Mr. Bacci to\naddress matters related to the tax receivable\nagreement.\n\nOn November 25, 2019, the GreenSky board held\na telephonic meeting, with members of senior\nmanagement and representatives of J.P. Morgan,\nFT Partners, Cravath and Troutman Pepper also\nin attendance. During the meeting,\nrepresentatives of Cravath reviewed the terms\nof a draft merger agreement that would be\nprovided to the bidders in the next round of\nthe sale process. The\nrepresentatives of Cravath reviewed that the\n\n-44-\n\ndraft merger agreement, consistent with the\nGreenSky charter and the direction of the\nGreenSky board and Mr. Zalik, provided for\nequal treatment of the shares of GreenSky\nClass A common\nstock and the Common Units of GreenSky\nHoldings (each of which Common Units was\nrepresented by a share of GreenSky Class B\ncommon stock). The representatives of Cravath\nalso reviewed that the draft merger agreement\ncontained a \u0093majority of\nthe minority\u0094 closing condition, but did so in\na way that reflected that such a condition may\nbe appropriate only for some bidders (e.g.,\nthe bidders that required a rollover of all or\na portion of Mr. Zalik\u0092s equity). During\nthe discussion, the GreenSky board agreed that\nthe \u0093majority of minority\u0094 vote condition\nshould be included in the draft merger\nagreement so that it could be implemented if\nnecessary. Mr. Zalik expressed his view that\nhe also was\nagreeing to this condition in his capacity as\nthe controlling stockholder of GreenSky,\nnoting that he wanted this condition to be in\nplace before any negotiations with financial\nsponsor bidders took place with respect to\nprice or rollover terms. The\nrepresentatives of Cravath also discussed that\nsuch a condition might also be warranted\ndepending upon how the tax receivable\nagreement was treated in a particular\ntransaction, noting again that all members of\nthe GreenSky board other than\nMr. Bacci had economic interests in the tax\nreceivable agreement.\n\nThe GreenSky board discussed the treatment of\nthe tax receivable\nagreement in the draft merger agreement,\nincluding a discussion with the financial and\nlegal advisors that different bidders may\napproach the tax receivable agreement\ndifferently. The representatives of Cravath\nagain reviewed how tax receivable\nagreements had been treated in different ways\nin different precedent transactions, noting\nthat mathematically any reduction in the value\nof tax receivable agreement payments made\nunder a tax receivable agreement in a sale\ntransaction should inure to\nthe benefit of the relevant company\u0092s public\nstockholders. The representatives of Cravath\ndiscussed that the draft merger agreement was\nsilent as to the treatment of the tax\nreceivable agreement, thereby allowing bidders\nto make a proposal on\nhow to treat the tax receivable agreement. The\nrepresentatives of Cravath noted that the\nGreenSky 2019 special committee had created a\nsub-committee consisting solely of Mr. Bacci\nand that the sub-committee had been delegated\nfull authority of the GreenSky board to\nconsider, evaluate and recommend a course of\naction to the GreenSky board with respect to\nany proposed treatment (or recommended change\nin any\nproposed treatment) of the tax receivable\nagreement in a potential transaction. The\nrepresentatives of Cravath discussed the\nbenefits of having both the sub-committee of\nMr. Bacci and the \u0093majority\nof the minority\u0094 closing condition in the\ndraft merger agreement to address different\nscenarios that might play out with respect to\nthe tax receivable agreement based upon the\nbidder proposals.\n\nThe representatives of Cravath also noted that\nthe draft merger agreement contemplated that\nMr. Zalik would deliver a voting agreement in\nsupport of the transaction, noting that buyers\nwould expect such a commitment. Mr. Zalik\nstated to the GreenSky board that if the\nGreenSky board and the GreenSky 2019 special\ncommittee agreed to proceed with a transaction\nand the transaction\nwas otherwise satisfactory to him, he would be\nwilling to enter into a voting agreement.\n\nThe representatives of Cravath reviewed the\nother key terms and conditions of the draft\nmerger agreement and received feedback with\nrespect thereto. Following the meeting, the\nrepresentatives of Cravath worked with the\nmembers of the Compensation Committee of the\nGreenSky board to reflect the\nCompensation Committee\u0092s views on various\ncompensation and benefits terms addressed in\nthe draft merger agreement relating to the\ntreatment of GreenSky\u0092s employees.\n\nThe representatives of J.P. Morgan and FT\nPartners reported that GS Group, Financial\nSponsor A and Financial Sponsor C had each\nprovided\nfeedback that they were not likely to complete\ntheir due diligence in advance of the bid\ndeadline of December 9, 2019, that GS Group\nseemed to be working the hardest towards\ngetting to a transaction, and that the\nactivity level of each of\nFinancial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor C\nwas not the same as that of GS Group. In\nsubsequent communications in late November\n2019, the GreenSky board determined, following\nconsultation with its financial and legal\nadvisors, that the bid deadline\nshould be extended to December 16, 2019 to\nprovide all three parties with additional\ntime.\n\nOn November 27, 2019,\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan communicated to\nGS Group, Financial Sponsor A and Financial\nSponsor C that the bid deadline was being\nextended to December 16, 2019. Additionally, a\ndraft\n\n-45-\n\nmerger agreement was provided to each of GS\nGroup, Financial Sponsor A and Financial\nSponsor C. At this time, Financial Sponsor C\ndeclined to proceed further in the sale\nprocess.\n\nOn December 6, 2019, representatives of GS\nGroup contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan\nto request a meeting with Mr. Zalik to\ndiscuss potential post-closing employment of\nMr. Zalik by GS Group. During the\nconversation, the representatives of GS Group\nstated that GS Group would insist that Mr.\nZalik continue to run GreenSky as part of GS\nGroup for approximately\ntwo years post-closing and that the purpose of\nthe meeting would be to understand whether Mr.\nZalik would be willing to consider such\nemployment as a condition of the overall\ntransaction. In response, the representatives\nof J.P. Morgan\ncommunicated this request to the GreenSky\nboard, stating that such a meeting, if\nauthorized by the GreenSky board, could\npotentially occur on December 12, 2019.\nFollowing discussion, the GreenSky board\nauthorized Mr. Zalik to meet with\nrepresentatives of GS Group, subject to the\nsame parameters as previously approved by the\nGreenSky board with respect to any financial\nsponsor inquiries as to Mr. Zalik\u0092s\nwillingness to engage in a rollover and, in\nparticular that\nMr. Zalik was not to discuss any specific\neconomic or compensation terms with GS Group\nunless and until authorized to do so by the\nGreenSky board.\n\nOn December 7, 2019, a representative of\nFinancial Sponsor A contacted a representative\nof J.P. Morgan and stated that it would not be\nsubmitting a written proposal, explaining that\nits view of fundamental value was lower than\nthe closing price of $6.97 per share of\nGreenSky Class A common stock on December 6,\n2019. The representative of Financial Sponsor\nA expressed an\ninterest in a minority equity or preferred\nstock investment in GreenSky, should GreenSky\nultimately choose to remain a public company\nand have a need for primary capital.\n\nOn December 9, 2019, representatives of GS\nGroup sent to representatives of J.P. Morgan a\nrevised draft of the merger agreement (which\nis\nreferred to in this section of the proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u0093\u0097Background of\nthe Transactions\u0094 as the \u0093GS Group merger\nagreement\u0094), which was prepared by Sullivan &\nCromwell LLP (which we refer to\nas \u0093S&C\u0094), outside counsel to GS Group.\nRevised drafts were exchanged between Cravath\nand S&C during December 2019.\n\nDuring the course of December 2019, members of\nGreenSky management discussed that it would be\nimportant that GS Group, were it to enter into\nan agreement to acquire GreenSky, also provide\na backstop loan participation purchase\nfacility (which we refer to as the \u0093backstop\nfunding facility\u0094) in the event that post-\nsigning one or more of GreenSky\u0092s bank\npartners were to cease\nproviding funding for loans originated through\nthe GreenSky program in light of GreenSky\nultimately becoming a part of GS Group, and GS\nGroup potentially utilizing its own balance\nsheet (and not the bank partners) for funding\nloans originated\nthrough the GreenSky program on a post-\nacquisition basis. GreenSky communicated to GS\nGroup that the purpose of the backstop funding\nfacility would be to provide additional\nfunding for loans originated through the\nGreenSky program during the period\nbetween signing a merger agreement and closing\nthe transaction and, in the event that the\ntransaction did not close, for a period of\ntime after the merger agreement was\nterminated.\n\nOn December 12, 2019, Mr. Zalik and a\nrepresentative of J.P. Morgan met with\nrepresentatives of GS Group for the purpose\npreviously\ndiscussed with the GreenSky board.\n\nDuring mid to late December, representatives\nof Cravath and S&C discussed key items in\nrevised\ndrafts of the GS Group merger agreement. In\nthat discussion, the representatives of S&C\ninquired as to the inclusion in the draft GS\nGroup merger agreement of a \u0093majority of the\nminority\u0094 closing condition. The\nrepresentatives of\nCravath explained that both the GreenSky board\nand Mr. Zalik were of the view that if any\nbidder in the process proposed any\ndifferential treatment with respect to Mr.\nZalik such that he would be construed as\nreceiving beneficial\ndifferential consideration, the transaction\nmust be conditioned upon a non-waivable\n\u0093majority of the minority\u0094 closing condition.\nThe representatives of Cravath also stated\nthat, in addition, the\ntreatment of the tax receivable agreement\nmight also justify the same closing condition,\nof which condition both the GreenSky board and\nMr. Zalik were also supportive.\n\n-46-\n\nThe revised draft GS Group merger agreement\nincluded a requirement introduced by GS Group\nwhereby Mr. Zalik and other pre-IPO investors\nwould be required to subject an agreed-upon\nportion of their transaction proceeds to an\nescrow to indemnify GS Group against a number\nof diligence items, as\nwell as a requirement for Mr. Zalik to subject\nan additional portion of his transaction\nproceeds to a retention holdback such that Mr.\nZalik would only be entitled to those proceeds\nif he stayed employed by GS Group for a to-be-\nagreed-upon period of service.\n\nOn December 14, 2019,\nrepresentatives of GS Group contacted a\nrepresentative of J.P. Morgan and stated that\nGS Group would not be submitting a written\nproposal on the bid deadline of December 16,\n2019, and instead stated that despite its\ninitial indication of\ninterest of $9.00 to $10.00 per share of\nGreenSky Class A common stock, GS Group was\nnot prepared to submit a final written offer\nat a price higher than $7.00 per share of\nGreenSky Class A common stock, which price\nassumed the tax\nreceivable agreement would be paid out in full\nin connection with a transaction. The\nrepresentatives of GS Group indicated a\ncontinued interest in an acquisition of\nGreenSky and desire to continue due diligence.\nThe representative of J.P. Morgan\nresponded that GreenSky would likely expect GS\nGroup to improve upon that price.\n\nOn December 19, 2019, GreenSky issued a press\nrelease related to its ongoing efforts to\nstrengthen and diversify its funding\ncommitments. GreenSky\u0092s common stock closed at\n$8.57 per share that day.\n\nOn December 20, 2019, representatives of GS\nGroup contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan\nand stated that it would be standing down from\na potential transaction on account of the\ndifference between the trading price of\nGreenSky Class A common stock and their\nfundamental view of value. J.P. Morgan\ninformed GreenSky of GS Group\u0092s message.\n\nOn December 23, 2019, at the direction of\nGreenSky senior management, a representative\nof J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of GS\nGroup to confirm that they would be interested\nin continuing to pursue a potential\ntransaction. The representative of J.P. Morgan\ncommunicated that Mr. Zalik had indicated that\nhe, in his personal capacity as a tax\nreceivable agreement\nbeneficiary, would potentially be willing to\nsupport amending the tax receivable agreement\nto extinguish any payments due upon a change\nof control transaction with GS Group in order\nto obtain the best price for GreenSky\u0092s public\nstockholders,\neven if it meant doing so would significantly\nreduce the proceeds Mr. Zalik otherwise would\nhave received in a transaction. These\npayments, which would become contractually due\nto the tax receivable agreement beneficiaries,\ntotaled\napproximately $330 million at GS Group\u0092s offer\nprice of $7.00 per share of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock. The representative of J.P.\nMorgan further observed that extinguishing\nthese payments should enable GS Group to\nincrease the\ntotal consideration offered to GreenSky\u0092s\npublic stockholders by at least the same\napproximately $330 million amount, which was\nequivalent to approximately $1.80 on a per-\nshare basis.\n\nOn December 27, 2019, representatives of GS\nGroup contacted a representative of J.P.\nMorgan to note that while amending the tax\nreceivable agreement would inure to the\nbenefit of GreenSky\u0092s public stockholders, GS\nGroup was not prepared to increase the total\nconsideration to be paid in a potential\ntransaction. J.P. Morgan informed GreenSky of\nGS Group\u0092s message.\n\nOn December 30, 2019, Mr. Zalik spoke with Mr.\nDavid Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer of GS Group.\nMr. Zalik reiterated the strategic and\nfinancial benefits of the potential\ntransaction to both firms, but he stated that\nGS Group needed to deliver more value.\n\nOn January 15, 2020, representatives of GS\nGroup contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan\nand stated that GS Group was still having\ndifficulty raising its bid, but they wanted to\nmeet in person to discuss further.\n\nOn January 17, 2020, the GreenSky board held a\ntelephonic meeting, with members of senior\nmanagement and representatives of J.P. Morgan,\nFT Partners, Cravath and Troutman Pepper also\nin attendance. Mr. Zalik updated the GreenSky\nboard on the recent discussions with GS Group,\nincluding the\nrequest for an in-person\n\n-47-\n\nmeeting to discuss further. Mr. Zalik stated\nthat he believed such a meeting could be\nbeneficial, and would allow GreenSky\nmanagement to discuss with GS Group various\ninitiatives that might\nallow GS Group to find more value and increase\nits proposed purchase price. The GreenSky\nboard endorsed holding the meeting.\n\nDuring the\nmeeting, the representatives of Cravath\nreviewed with the GreenSky board their\ndiscussions with representatives of S&C\nregarding the GS Group merger agreement,\nnoting that there were still a large number of\nmaterial open issues in the GS Group\nmerger agreement. Members of GreenSky senior\nmanagement also discussed the need for GS\nGroup to provide a backstop funding facility,\nwhich had been communicated to GS Group.\nFollowing discussion, the GreenSky board\nauthorized J.P. Morgan to inform\nGS Group that the GreenSky board was\nsupportive of having an in-person meeting to\ncontinue to discuss a transaction, but was not\nsupportive of a transaction at GS Group\u0092s\nthen-current bid, to communicate\nGreenSky\u0092s positions on various issues arising\nfrom the GS merger agreement and to request\nthat GS Group provide an update on any\nremaining diligence items, an understanding of\nGS Group\u0092s view on providing a backstop\nfunding facility, an\nunderstanding of GS Group\u0092s potential timeline\nto signing a transaction and additional\ninformation on the proposed terms of a\nretention holdback for Mr. Zalik.\n\nLater that day, at the direction of the\nGreenSky board, representatives of J.P. Morgan\ncontacted representatives of GS Group and\ndiscussed the\ntopics that the GreenSky board had previously\nauthorized J.P. Morgan to communicate to GS\nGroup.\n\nOver the next several days,\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan and GS Group\ncontinued to discuss these items and scheduled\nan in-person meeting in Atlanta for January\n30, 2020.\n\nOn January 30, 2020, representatives of GS\nGroup met with representatives of GreenSky,\nincluding Mr. Zalik, at J.P. Morgan\u0092s\nAtlanta offices, with a representative of J.P.\nMorgan also in attendance. At the meeting, the\nparties discussed GreenSky\u0092s business and\nvarious initiatives that GreenSky was\nundertaking and how those initiatives might\npositively impact\nGreenSky\u0092s outlook. Representatives of GS\nGroup also reviewed proposed terms of a\nbackstop funding facility, its outstanding due\ndiligence items and the proposed terms of the\nretention holdback for Mr. Zalik, which\ncontemplated that\nMr. Zalik agree that GS Group withhold $200\nmillion of his transaction proceeds for a two-\nyear period, with all amounts paid to Mr.\nZalik only if he remained employed at GS Group\nfor the entire\nthree-year period. The terms also proposed a\n$100 million incentive payment to Mr. Zalik\nbased upon criteria such as merchant\nretention, originations and growth. Mr. Zalik\nrejected the $100 million incentive payment at\nthe\nmeeting, stating that he was not willing to\naccept any additional or differential\nconsideration from that of GreenSky\u0092s public\nstockholders, and that while subjecting $200\nmillion of his proceeds to a retention\nholdback would put him at a\nsignificant economic disadvantage to\nGreenSky\u0092s public stockholders, he might be\nwilling to do so in order to facilitate a\nbeneficial transaction for GreenSky\u0092s public\nstockholders. However, Mr. Zalik emphasized\nthat he was not going\nto accept any differential treatment that\nbenefited or advantaged him relative to\nGreenSky\u0092s public stockholders. At the\nmeeting, the representatives of GS Group\ncontinued to insist upon a $100 million\nindemnity escrow to be funded with\ntransaction proceeds of Mr. Zalik and the\nother pre-IPO investors for various diligence\nitems. The representatives of GS Group stated\nthat GS Group was prepared to work toward\ncompletion of its due\ndiligence and announcement of a transaction in\nFebruary 2020.\n\nOn January 31, 2020, the GreenSky board met\ntelephonically, with\nmembers of senior management and\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan, FT Partners,\nCravath and Troutman Pepper also in\nattendance. Mr. Zalik provided a recap of the\nmeeting that had occurred the prior day,\nincluding his rejection of the\n$100 million incentive payment that was\noffered to him by GS Group as part of his\nretention holdback. The GreenSky board\ndiscussed with senior management the\npossibility of GS Group increasing its price,\nand the work that would need to be done\nto be able to finalize transaction\ndocumentation, including the backstop funding\nfacility. The GreenSky board concluded that it\nwould be most productive to advance due\ndiligence and transaction documentation with\nGS Group and then push GS Group on\nvaluation when a transaction was more\nachievable in the near term.\n\n-48-\n\nThe GreenSky board also discussed whether or\nnot to\nre-engage with any of the other parties that\nhad signed non-disclosure agreements in 2019,\nand Mr. Zalik expressed his view that GreenSky\nshould focus on strategic\nacquirors with captive funding sources in\nlight of GreenSky\u0092s funding needs.\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan noted that J.P.\nMorgan had contacted nearly two dozen banks as\npart of the 2019 process and that only four\nsigned non-disclosure agreements other than GS\nGroup. The GreenSky board reviewed those four\nparties and the feedback that they had given\nduring the process and concluded that it was\nnot likely that any of those four would\nbe interested in pursuing a transaction at a\nprice higher than that being contemplated by\nGS Group or at all. The GreenSky board also\ndiscussed possibly contacting Financial\nSponsor A and Financial Sponsor C, but noted\nthat each of those parties had\nwithdrawn from the process in December 2019\nwithout completing substantial due diligence\ndespite being moved forward in the process.\nAfter discussion, the GreenSky board concluded\nthat GreenSky should continue to work with GS\nGroup given its\ncontinued interest in a potential transaction\nand the feedback that had been received by\nother parties in 2019 in the sale process.\n\nOn\nFebruary 4, 2020, a representative of GS Group\ncontacted a representative of J.P. Morgan to\nupdate J.P. Morgan on the work GS Group was\nundertaking internally to provide a revised\nproposal.\n\nOn February 5, 2020, Cravath sent to S&C a\nrevised draft of the GS Group merger\nagreement, which rejected the concept of an\nindemnity\nescrow and otherwise reflected feedback from\nprior discussions with the GreenSky board and\nsenior management.\n\nOn February 6, 2020,\nthe GreenSky board held a regularly scheduled\nin person meeting. During the meeting, Mr.\nZalik provided an update to the GreenSky board\nregarding the ongoing discussions with GS\nGroup.\n\nOver the next week, GreenSky and GS Group and\ntheir respective advisors engaged in\ndiscussions regarding due diligence items and\ntransaction\ndocumentation, including various initiatives\nthat GreenSky was undertaking and how those\ninitiatives might positively impact GreenSky\u0092s\noutlook.\n\nOn February 10, 2020, representatives of GS\nGroup contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan\nto indicate that, despite their renewed due\ndiligence efforts, GS Group was not prepared\nto raise its bid, and was unwilling to\nwithdraw its request for a $100 million\nindemnity escrow from Mr. Zalik and other pre-\nIPO investors.\n\nOn February 12, 2020, a representative of\nGreenSky, a representative of GS Group and a\nrepresentative of J.P. Morgan met in GS\nGroup\u0092s offices in New York to continue\ndiscussing the benefits of the potential\ntransaction and potential paths to resolving\nthe open transaction structure and diligence\nitems. Subsequently, on February 20, 2020, a\nrepresentative of GS\nGroup contacted a representative of J.P.\nMorgan to indicate GS Group\u0092s desire to\ncontinue discussions regarding a potential\ntransaction following GreenSky\u0092s release of\nits 2019 financial results, scheduled for\nMarch 2, 2020.\n\nIn early March, following GreenSky\u0092s release\nof its 2019 financial results, representatives\nof GS Group contacted representatives of J.P.\nMorgan to discuss open due diligence requests\nand next steps in a potential transaction.\nHowever, as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed,\nrepresentatives of GS Group advised Mr. Zalik,\nMr. Benjamin and\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan that GS Group\nwanted to cease merger discussions.\n\nOn May 1, 2020, the GreenSky board held a\nregularly\nscheduled telephonic meeting. During the\nmeeting, Mr. Benjamin provided an update to\nthe GreenSky board with respect to GreenSky\u0092s\nstrategic alternatives review process, noting\nthat GreenSky\u0092s Q1 earnings release would\ndisclose that\nGreenSky expects to make an announcement\nregarding the outcome of the process no later\nthan when GreenSky reports its Q2 financial\nresults.\n\nOn July 20, 2020, the GreenSky board held a\nregularly scheduled telephonic meeting. During\nthe meeting, Mr. Benjamin provided an\nupdate to the GreenSky board with respect to\nGreenSky\u0092s strategic alternatives review\nprocess, confirming with the GreenSky board\nthat GreenSky would announce the conclusion of\nthe process in its Q2 earnings release unless\na viable bidder\nemerged prior to the issuance of the release\non August 10, 2020.\n\n-49-\n\nOn August 10, 2020, GreenSky publicly\nannounced that it had brought to a close its\nstrategic alternatives review process.\n\nAfter discussions regarding a potential\ntransaction ceased, representatives of\nGreenSky and GS\nGroup remained in periodic contact with\nrespect to commercial matters unrelated to a\npotential acquisition of GreenSky. In\nparticular, in September 2020, an affiliate of\nGS Group provided financing for a third\nparty\u0092s acquisition of\nparticipations in consumer finance loans\noriginated through the GreenSky program, and\nin October 2020 and May 2021, an affiliate of\nGS Group acquired participations in consumer\nfinance loans originated through the GreenSky\nprogram (with the GS Group\naffiliate securitizing the participations that\nit acquired in August 2021). Each of these\ntransactions occurred in the ordinary course\nof business and unrelated to a potential\nacquisition transaction. During the course of\nthese periodic contacts,\nincluding periodic outreach by Mr. Solomon to\nMr. Zalik, representatives of GS Group\nexpressed their view that an acquisition of\nGreenSky was still of interest to GS Group at\nthe appropriate time.\n\nOn May 29, 2021, at the request of GS Group,\nMr. Solomon and Mr. Zalik met to discuss the\nmarket landscape, GS Group and\nGreenSky. During this discussion, Mr. Solomon\nexpressed GS Group\u0092s interest in restarting\ndiscussions regarding a potential acquisition\nof GreenSky. During the meeting, and in a\nsubsequent discussion with Ms. Stephanie\nCohen, Global Co-Head of Consumer and Wealth\nManagement of GS Group, Mr. Zalik indicated\nthat he continued to believe GreenSky and GS\nGroup\u0092s consumer businesses were good partners\nfor each other and that the GreenSky\nboard would be interested in additional\nopportunities to create stockholder value. Mr.\nZalik further noted that GreenSky was\ndemonstrating solid financial performance and\nexpected to raise its outlook for fiscal year\n2021 profitability when it\nnext reported earnings. Mr. Zalik suggested\nthat GS Group work with representatives of\nJ.P. Morgan to obtain updated due diligence\ninformation so that GS Group could make an\ninformed acquisition proposal to the GreenSky\nboard. Subsequently,\nMr. Zalik informed the GreenSky board of GS\nGroup\u0092s renewed interested in a potential\nacquisition of GreenSky.\n\nOn June 16,\n2021, representatives of Cravath and S&C\nnegotiated an extension of the non-disclosure\nagreement that GreenSky and GS Group\npreviously had entered into in connection with\ntheir prior discussions.\nThereafter, representatives of GreenSky\nprovided representatives of GS Group with\ncertain updated due diligence information,\nincluding GreenSky\u0092s perspective on demand for\nhome improvement products and services and\nrelated financing, the\nongoing positive impact of GreenSky\u0092s\ninvestments in its consumer credit and\nmerchant risk underwriting capabilities, and\nGreenSky\u0092s then-current expectations for 2021,\nso that GS Group could evaluate whether to\nmake a new proposal for an\nacquisition of GreenSky.\n\nOn July 2, 2021, GS Group delivered a written\nproposal to acquire GreenSky through an all-\nstock transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.02\nGS Group shares for each share of GreenSky\nClass A common stock, which represented a\nprice of approximately $7.50 per share of\nGreenSky Class A common\nstock based upon the closing trading price per\nshare of GS Group common stock on July 1,\n2021. GS Group\u0092s proposal required that no\npayments be made under the tax receivable\nagreement in connection with the transaction,\nthat\n$50 million worth of the merger consideration\npayable to the pre-IPO holders be held in\nescrow for three years to satisfy potential\nindemnity claims against contingent\nliabilities, and that\n$200 million of Mr. Zalik\u0092s proceeds from the\ntransaction be held back and released upon\ncompletion of two years of service at GS\nGroup. The proposal was further contingent\nupon satisfactory resolution of a previously\ndisclosed\ninvestigation of GreenSky by the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau (which we refer to\nas the \u0093CFPB\u0094). The proposal did not reference\nwhether GS Group was still willing to provide\na backstop funding facility. Mr. Zalik\ncirculated\nthe proposal to the members of the GreenSky\nboard following receipt.\n\nFollowing receipt of the proposal, and\nfollowing discussions and a\nconsensus among GreenSky board members, at the\ndirection of the GreenSky board,\nrepresentatives of GreenSky and J.P. Morgan\ninformed representatives of GS Group,\nincluding Mr. Zalik to Mr. Solomon, that GS\nGroup\u0092s proposal was not sufficient\nfor GreenSky to engage in further discussions.\nSubsequently, on July 9, 2021, Mr. Solomon\ninformed Mr. Zalik that GS Group was working\non a revised proposal at a higher per-share\nvalue.\n\n-50-\n\nOn July 12, 2021, GreenSky entered into a\nconsent order with the CFPB.\n\nOn July 14, 2021, representatives of Cravath\nand S&C had a telephone conversation regarding\nthe July 2, 2021 written proposal\nsubmitted by GS Group. During that\nconversation, the representatives of S&C\nstated that they were working on a revised\ndraft of the GS Group merger agreement in the\nevent GS Group and GreenSky proceeded towards\nsigning a definitive agreement. In\nthat connection, the representatives of S&C\ninquired about the \u0093majority of the minority\u0094\nclosing condition previously included in the\ndraft GS Group merger agreement, to which the\nrepresentative of Cravath reiterated that such\ncondition was included at the direction of the\nGreenSky board, with the concurrence of Mr.\nZalik, in the event that a buyer proposed a\ntransaction that provided for beneficial\ndifferential consideration for Mr. Zalik. The\nrepresentatives\nof S&C and Cravath discussed that the terms of\nthe GS Group proposal were, in fact,\ndetrimental to Mr. Zalik relative to the\npublic stockholders of GreenSky because the GS\nGroup proposal (i) required Mr. Zalik to\nsubject\n$200 million in proceeds to a retention\nholdback arrangement and (ii) required that no\npayments be made under the tax receivable\nagreement, which would result in Mr. Zalik\nultimately forfeiting significant value that\nhe would\notherwise be entitled to under the tax\nreceivable agreement based on the proposed\npurchase price. The representatives of S&C\ninquired as to whether Mr. Zalik was also\nrefusing to accept any additional incentive or\nother compensation in\nexchange for the $200 million retention\nholdback (such as the $100 million incentive\nthat GS Group previously had proposed). The\nrepresentative of Cravath stated that Mr.\nZalik would not accept any such beneficial\ntreatment, and\ninstead would only require employment terms\nand conditions of a similarly situated GS\nGroup employee, which the representative of\nCravath stated put Mr. Zalik in a worse\nposition relative to GreenSky\u0092s public\nstockholders taking into\naccount the other terms being imposed upon\nhim. Following that discussion, the\nrepresentatives of S&C stated that they did\nnot intend to include the \u0093majority of the\nminority\u0094 voting condition in the revised\ndraft merger agreement.\n\nOn July 15, 2021, GS Group delivered a revised\nwritten proposal pursuant to which it\nincreased the proposed exchange ratio to 0.024\nshares of GS Group common stock for each share\nof GreenSky Class A common stock, which\nrepresented a price of $9.00 per share of\nGreenSky Class A common stock based upon the\ntrading closing price per share of GS Group\ncommon stock on\nJuly 14, 2021. The proposal still required\nthat no payments be made under the tax\nreceivable agreement and otherwise contained\nterms consistent with what was reflected in\nthe July 2, 2021 proposal, except that GS\nGroup stated that it would\nbe willing to implement a backstop funding\nfacility to purchase eligible consumer loans\noriginated as part of the GreenSky program.\n\nOn\nJuly 18, 2021, the GreenSky board met\ntelephonically, with members of senior\nmanagement and representatives of J.P. Morgan,\nCravath and Troutman Pepper also in\nattendance, to discuss the latest developments\nin the discussions with GS Group,\nincluding its July 15, 2021 proposal. The\nrepresentatives of Cravath again reviewed with\nthe GreenSky board their fiduciary duties\nunder Delaware law generally, as well as in\nthe context of considering a potential sale of\nGreenSky. The\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed the\n2019-2020 process relating to a potential sale\nof GreenSky, including the discussions with GS\nGroup at that time, and GS Group\u0092s renewed\ninterest in acquiring GreenSky subsequent to\nthose discussions.\nThe financial and legal advisors reviewed the\nkey terms of GS Group\u0092s July 15, 2021\nproposal. Mr. Zalik reiterated that he would\nbe willing to agree to the retention holdback\nrequested by GS Group if that would facilitate\na\ntransaction with GS Group, even though it\nwould disadvantage him relative to GreenSky\u0092s\npublic stockholders, and that he would not\nseek any special compensation from GS Group\nfor agreeing to do so. The financial and legal\nadvisors also reviewed\nwith the GreenSky board considerations\nrelating to GS Group offering an all-stock\ntransaction. The representatives of Cravath\nand J.P. Morgan then discussed with the\nGreenSky board GS Group\u0092s request for\nan indemnity escrow, the terms of the tax\nreceivable agreement and GS Group\u0092s request\nthat the tax receivable agreement be amended\nto relinquish all payments. Following this\ndiscussion, Mr. Zalik stated that he would\nsupport amending the\ntax receivable agreement to extinguish any\npayments due upon a change of control\ntransaction with GS Group in order to obtain\nthe best price for GreenSky stockholders, even\nif it meant he would be surrendering material\nconsideration to which he\nwould otherwise be entitled.\n\nThereafter, the GreenSky board discussed\nwhether J.P. Morgan should contact other\npotentially interested\nparties were the GreenSky board to continue\ndiscussions with GS Group. J.P. Morgan\nreviewed the various\n\n-51-\n\ncounterparties that could potentially be\ninterested in engaging in discussions, but\nnoted that most had been contacted during the\n2019-2020 process and had not contacted\nGreenSky since then\ndespite GreenSky having publicly pursued a\nsales process at that time. The GreenSky board\nthen discussed the list of potential\ncounterparties, and Mr. Sheft suggested that a\nfinancial sponsor (which we refer to as\n\u0093Financial Sponsor\nD\u0094) should be contacted were GreenSky to\ncontinue discussions with GS Group in light of\nthat financial sponsor\u0092s prior investments in\nthe financial institutions space. The GreenSky\nboard decided to adjourn the meeting and\nreconsider the\nsituation further at a subsequent meeting.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Mr. Sheft reached out\nto a representative of Financial Sponsor D\nwith whom he had a pre-existing relationship\nand told the representative that if Financial\nSponsor D were interested in potentially\npursuing a transaction, that now might be the\nright time to do so.\nMr. Sheft stated that if Financial Sponsor D\nwere interested, Mr. Sheft would have the\nrelevant representative of J.P. Morgan contact\nthe appropriate representatives of Financial\nSponsor D. The representative of Financial\nSponsor D stated\nthat he believed Financial Sponsor D would be\ninterested, and asked Mr. Sheft to have J.P.\nMorgan make contact.\n\nOn July 19,\n2021, the GreenSky board met telephonically,\nwith a member of senior management and a\nrepresentative of J.P. Morgan also in\nattendance. After discussing GS Group\u0092s July\n15, 2021 proposal, the members of the GreenSky\nboard who were present\nat the meeting authorized GreenSky\u0092s\nmanagement and advisors to continue\ndiscussions with GS Group and agreed to\nconfirm with members of the GreenSky board not\nin attendance that they were supportive of\nsuch endorsement, which was done\nfollowing the meeting. Mr. Sheft reported to\nthe GreenSky board his contact with the\nrepresentative of Financial Sponsor D, and the\nGreenSky board instructed the representative\nof J.P. Morgan to contact Financial Sponsor D\nto arrange for the\nexecution of a customary non-disclosure\nagreement and the provision of preliminary\ninformation regarding GreenSky. In particular,\nthe GreenSky board noted that introducing\ncompetition would be beneficial to\nthe process. Mr. Zalik stated that, consistent\nwith the GreenSky board\u0092s guidance, he would\ncontact Mr. Solomon and tell him that $9.00\nper share was insufficient.\n\nLater on July 19, 2021, Mr. Zalik contacted\nMr. Solomon and delivered the GreenSky board\u0092s\nguidance. On July 19,\n2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan also\ncontacted representatives of Financial Sponsor\nD to inquire whether Financial Sponsor D would\nbe interested in submitting a bid to acquire\nGreenSky and the representatives of Financial\nSponsor D indicated\nthat Financial Sponsor D would be interested\nin doing so.\n\nAlso on July 19, 2021, at the direction of the\nGreenSky board, representatives\nof J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of GS\nGroup to indicate, among other things, that a\nprice per share significantly above $9.00 per\nshare of GreenSky Class A common stock would\nbe required if the condition that no payments\nbe made under\nthe tax receivable agreement in connection\nwith the transaction were to be included and\nalso that GreenSky was not willing to accept\nan indemnity escrow as a condition.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, GreenSky and Financial\nSponsor D executed a non-disclosure agreement,\nwhich\ncontained a customary \u0093standstill\u0094 provision\nthat would expire were GreenSky to enter into\na transaction to sell itself to a third party.\nFinancial Sponsor D subsequently began its due\ndiligence review of GreenSky and its business.\n\nOn July 21, 2021, representatives of Financial\nSponsor D had a videoconference meeting with\nMr. Zalik and Mr. Sheft, with a\nrepresentative from J.P. Morgan also in\nattendance, to discuss GreenSky\u0092s business.\n\nOn July 22, 2021, Financial Sponsor D\ndelivered a written proposal to acquire\nGreenSky in an all-cash transaction at a\nvaluation of $9.50 per share of GreenSky Class\nA common stock. The proposal assumed that any\npayments due under the tax\nreceivable agreement in connection with the\ntransaction would be extinguished in respect\nof a change of control acquisition of\nGreenSky. The proposal also indicated that it\nwould not be dependent on third-party\nfinancing and it included a request\nfor exclusivity. Mr. Zalik circulated the\nproposal to the members of the GreenSky board\nfollowing receipt.\n\nOn July 23, 2021,\nthe GreenSky board met telephonically, with\nmembers of senior management and\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan, Cravath and\nTroutman Pepper also in attendance, to discuss\nthe latest\n\n-52-\n\ndevelopments in GreenSky\u0092s discussions with GS\nGroup and Financial Sponsor D. Prior to the\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan joining the\nmeeting, the representatives of Cravath\nreviewed with\nthe GreenSky board a letter disclosing J.P.\nMorgan\u0092s relationships with GreenSky, GS Group\nand Financial Sponsor D, and the GreenSky\nboard concluded that in light of J.P. Morgan\u0092s\nseveral year history in working with GreenSky,\nit did not\nbelieve that any of these relationships would\nimpair J.P. Morgan acting as GreenSky\u0092s\nfinancial advisor in connection with the\ndiscussions with GS Group and Financial\nSponsor D. The representatives of J.P. Morgan\nthen joined the meeting.\nMr. Andrew Kang, Executive Vice President and\nChief Financial Officer of GreenSky, reviewed\nforecasts for GreenSky, as well as the\nassumptions underlying those forecasts. Those\nforecasts are described more fully under the\nsection entitled\n\u0093The Mergers\u0097Certain Unaudited Financial\nInformation\u0094 beginning on page 73 of this\nproxy statement/prospectus. The\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed\ntheir preliminary valuation analysis of\nGreenSky based on the\nforecasts and reviewed their recent\ndiscussions with representatives of GS Group\nand Financial Sponsor D.\n\nThereafter, the GreenSky board\ndiscussed Financial Sponsor D\u0092s July 22, 2021\nproposal and how it compared to GS Group\u0092s\nJuly 15, 2021 proposal. The GreenSky board\nthen discussed with its financial and legal\nadvisors the potential timetables for GS Group\nand\nFinancial Sponsor D to conduct their due\ndiligence and reach an agreement on\ntransaction terms. The representatives of J.P.\nMorgan noted that the representatives of\nFinancial Sponsor D had indicated that Mr.\nZalik\u0092s continued involvement\nin GreenSky in some fashion following an\nacquisition was important.\n\nThe representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed\nwith the GreenSky board a\nlist of potential additional parties that\ncould be approached as potential acquirors of\nGreenSky and, given the number of potential\ncounterparties that had already been contacted\nregarding a potential sale of GreenSky in 2019\nand had not pursued a\ntransaction with GreenSky, noted the potential\nbenefit of limiting the number of potential\ncounterparties to be contacted at this stage\nto those most likely to be interested in a\ntransaction, including, among other reasons,\nto reduce the risk of\ninformation leaks, manage the limited\nbandwidth of GreenSky management to engage\nwith multiple bidders and reduce the risk of\nlosing either GS Group or Financial Sponsor D\nif a number of additional parties were\nintroduced into the process. Following\ndiscussion, the GreenSky board determined it\nwould be beneficial to contact a limited\nnumber of additional parties to solicit\ninterest in engaging in discussions regarding\na transaction, and to move forward in\ndiscussion with each of GS Group and\nFinancial Sponsor D.\n\nMr. Zalik then noted that both GS Group and\nFinancial Sponsor D had provided offers that\nwere conditioned on\nthe beneficiaries under the tax receivable\nagreement receiving no payments upon\nconsummation of or following a transaction.\nMr. Zalik stated that he had asked legal\ncounsel to prepare an amendment to the tax\nreceivable agreement to provide for\nthat treatment, contingent upon a transaction\nbeing executed at a price equal to or greater\nthan $9.00 per share of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock. Mr. Zalik reiterated to the\nGreenSky board that he would be supportive of\nan amendment to\nthe tax receivable agreement if that was the\npath to obtain the highest price for GreenSky\nstockholders, even if that was detrimental to\nhim economically. The GreenSky board discussed\nthe requisite tax receivable agreement\nbeneficiary vote necessary\nto implement an amendment. Mr. Zalik and Mr.\nSheft, the second largest beneficiary under\nthe tax receivable agreement, agreed to\ndiscuss the tax receivable agreement amendment\nfurther in the coming days.\n\nOn July 26, 2021, at the direction of the\nGreenSky board, representatives of J.P. Morgan\ncontacted representatives of Financial Sponsor\nD\nand informed them that GreenSky was interested\nin continuing discussions and providing access\nto due diligence information, but that a\nvaluation of $9.50 per share of GreenSky Class\nA common stock was insufficient.\n\nOn July 27, 2021, holders of the requisite\npercentage of tax receivable agreement\nbeneficiaries executed signature pages to the\namendment\nto the tax receivable agreement, but several\nasked that their signatures not be added to\nthe amendment unless and until a transaction\nwas imminent. The amendment provided that if\nGreenSky consummated a sale transaction at a\nprice equal to or greater\nthan $9.00 per share of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock pursuant to a definitive\nagreement entered into by October 21, 2021,\nthen there would be no payments in respect of\nthe tax receivable agreement upon consummation\nof or following such a\ntransaction.\n\n-53-\n\nOn August 4, 2021, Mr. Solomon contacted Mr.\nZalik to discuss the current\nstate of GS Group\u0092s interest in a potential\nacquisition of GreenSky and the timetable for\nreaching agreement on transaction terms. Mr.\nSolomon said that GS Group would not be in\nposition to engage for several weeks given\nother matters\noccupying GS Group\u0092s attention at that time.\nMr. Zalik told Mr. Solomon that GS Group may\nhave to re-engage on a more accelerated basis\nbecause there was another party interested in\nacquiring\nGreenSky.\n\nOn August 5, 2021, at the direction of the\nGreenSky board, representatives of J.P. Morgan\ncontacted two other parties to\nsolicit potential interest in a strategic\ntransaction with GreenSky. One of such parties\n(which we refer to as \u0093Strategic Party E\u0094) had\nnot been contacted during the 2019-2020\nprocess and the other of such parties (which\nwe refer to as\n\u0093Strategic Party F\u0094) had been contacted, but\nhad not engaged in any meaningful discussion.\nBoth parties indicated they might be\ninterested in a potential transaction with\nGreenSky. Strategic Party E stated that it\nwould only be able to\npursue an all-stock transaction. Strategic\nParty F stated that it might be interested in\npursuing a transaction and requested that a\nnon-disclosure agreement be sent for\nits consideration.\n\nOn August 8, 2021, representatives of\nFinancial Sponsor D contacted representatives\nof J.P. Morgan, stating that\nFinancial Sponsor D wanted to preempt any\nprocess GreenSky might be running for a sale\nof the company. Representatives of J.P. Morgan\ninformed Financial Sponsor D that they could\nnot respond to that request, but that they\nbelieved GreenSky would be\nseeking an appropriate premium in a sale\ntransaction and encouraged Financial Sponsor D\nto make the most compelling proposal that it\ncould.\n\nOn August 10, 2021, representatives of\nFinancial Sponsor D contacted representatives\nof J.P. Morgan and stated that Financial\nSponsor D\nwas prepared to increase the valuation of\ntheir proposal to acquire GreenSky to $10.50\nper share of GreenSky Class A common stock in\nan all-cash transaction, assuming that any\npayments due under the tax\nreceivable agreement in connection with the\ntransaction would be extinguished in respect\nof a change of control acquisition of\nGreenSky.\n\nOn August 11, 2021, a representative of\nCravath and Mr. Sheft discussed the nature of\nMr. Sheft\u0092s relationship with\nFinancial Sponsor D. Based on those\ndiscussions, Mr. Sheft agreed to recuse\nhimself from all GreenSky board and committee\ndiscussions going forward so long as Financial\nSponsor D remained a potentially interested\nacquiror. Mr. Sheft also\nagreed that he would not engage in any further\ndiscussions with representatives of Financial\nSponsor D regarding a potential transaction or\nengage with Financial Sponsor D regarding any\nrollover terms (were those to be proposed)\nunless and until\nauthorized to do so by the GreenSky board.\n\nOn August 11, 2021, the GreenSky board (except\nfor Mr. Sheft, who had recused\nhimself) met by videoconference, with members\nof senior management and representatives of\nJ.P. Morgan, Cravath and Troutman Pepper also\nin attendance. A representative of Cravath\nreviewed with the GreenSky board his\ndiscussions with Mr. Sheft\nregarding Mr. Sheft\u0092s recusal. The\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with\nthe GreenSky board the latest developments in\ntheir discussions with Financial Sponsor D,\nMr. Zalik\u0092s discussions with Mr. Solomon, the\nresponses from Strategic Party E and Strategic\nParty F and other recent sale transactions\nthat had been announced in the consumer\nfinance sector. The representatives of J.P.\nMorgan reported that Strategic Party E had\nstated that it could complete a\ntransaction only if most or all of the\nconsideration would be in the form of stock,\nwhich would result in GreenSky stockholders\nholding a material stake in the combined\ncompany. The GreenSky board discussed\nStrategic Party E and its business, noting\nthat they did not believe there was sufficient\nstrategic merit or fit in a combination of the\ntwo companies that would cause the GreenSky\nboard to recommend such a transaction to the\nGreenSky stockholders. Mr. Zalik confirmed\nthat this was his\nview, that he did not see sufficient strategic\nmerit in a combination and that he would not\nwant to exchange his stock in GreenSky for\nstock in Strategic Party E. The GreenSky board\nthen instructed J.P. Morgan to contact\nStrategic Party E and inform\nit that the GreenSky board was not supportive\nof an all-stock transaction with it and to\ninquire whether Strategic Party E would\nnonetheless be interested in continuing to\nexplore a transaction. The GreenSky\nboard also discussed Strategic Party F, and\nthe GreenSky board authorized J.P. Morgan to\nsend it a non-disclosure agreement.\n\n-54-\n\nThe GreenSky board then discussed the other\npotentially interested parties that had been\ndiscussed at prior meetings of the GreenSky\nboard, and the representatives of J.P. Morgan\nexpressed their view, which was shared by the\nGreenSky board, that they did not believe that\nany of those parties would likely be\ninterested in pursuing a\ntransaction with GreenSky on a reasonable\ntimeline or at all. The GreenSky board\ndiscussed that GS Group and Financial Sponsor\nD were likely to be the parties that were the\nmost interested in pursuing a transaction, and\nthat it did not make sense to\nreach out to more parties. The GreenSky board\nnoted that it had engaged in a public sale\nprocess in 2019-2020 and that only GS Group\nhad submitted a proposal that was actionable\nat the time. The GreenSky board also noted\nthat any other parties added\nto the process would need significant time to\nconduct due diligence, and that allowing them\nto do so would stress the bandwidth of\nmanagement who had spent significant time\nalready with GS Group and Financial Sponsor D\nand would have to continue\ndoing so going forward. The GreenSky board\nalso discussed the importance of not losing\neither the GS Group or the Financial Sponsor D\nproposals, and that expanding the process\ncould risk doing so. The GreenSky board also\ndiscussed with\nrepresentatives of Cravath the terms of the\nmerger agreement that would allow the GreenSky\nboard to respond to unsolicited proposals that\nsurfaced after a merger agreement was signed.\nAfter considering all of these factors, the\nGreenSky board\nconcluded that GreenSky should focus on GS\nGroup and Financial Sponsor D, and Strategic\nParty F were it to engage, and try to reach a\ndefinitive agreement at the highest value\nwithout delay.\n\nA representative of Cravath then reviewed with\nthe GreenSky board what steps could be taken\nin the event Financial Sponsor D offered or\nrequired a rollover by Mr. Zalik (and\npotentially Mr. Sheft) and the legal\nprinciples that would be implicated. Based on\nthese discussions, the GreenSky board\nconcluded that the special committee should be\nreinstated on the same basis as\nit had been in 2019 (except there was no need\nfor the tax receivable agreement sub-committee\nin light of the requirements from each of the\nactive bidders that there be no tax receivable\nagreement payments).\nThe representative of Cravath also reviewed\nthe \u0093majority of the minority\u0094 closing\ncondition, and the GreenSky board, with Mr.\nZalik concurring, determined that any\ntransaction with Financial Sponsor D that\nincluded a rollover should\nbe subject to both the special committee and\n\u0093majority of the minority\u0094 procedural\nsafeguards.\n\nThe GreenSky board then\nauthorized the reconstitution of the special\ncommittee initially comprised of Mr. Babbit,\nMr. Bacci and Mr. Freishtat, which committee\nwe refer to as the \u0093GreenSky special\ncommittee.\u0094 The GreenSky board authorized the\nGreenSky special committee to, among other\nthings, review, consider, evaluate, negotiate,\nexplore and, as appropriate, recommend to the\nGreenSky board for approval any possible\nstrategic transaction outside the ordinary\ncourse of business in which\none or more officers, directors or other\naffiliates of GreenSky may have an interest\nthat is additional to and/or different from\nthe interests of GreenSky\u0092s unaffiliated\nstockholders, and resolved that the GreenSky\nboard would not approve or\nrecommend any such transaction for approval by\nGreenSky stockholders without a prior\nfavorable recommendation by the GreenSky\nspecial committee. The GreenSky board also\nauthorized the GreenSky special committee to\nretain, at GreenSky\u0092s expense,\nits own legal, financial and other advisors.\n\nOn August 12, 2021, Mr. Zalik contacted Mr.\nSolomon to let him know that\nanother party was advancing its interest in\nacquiring GreenSky, and that GS Group would\nneed to reengage quickly if it was interested\nin pursuing an acquisition. Subsequently, on\nAugust 15, 2021, Mr. Solomon contacted Mr.\nZalik and\ninformed him that GS Group would restart its\ndue diligence effort.\n\nOn August 16, 2021, representatives of Cravath\nprovided a draft\nmerger agreement (which is referred to in this\nsection of the proxy statement/prospectus\nentitled \u0093\u0097Background of the Transactions\u0094 as\nthe \u0093Financial Sponsor D merger agreement\u0094) to\nFinancial Sponsor D, which\ndraft merger agreement contained a \u0093majority\nof the minority\u0094 vote condition.\n\nOn August 18, 2021, representatives of\nFinancial Sponsor D met telephonically with\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan to provide a\nverbal proposal to acquire GreenSky at a\nvaluation of $10.75 per share of GreenSky\nClass A common stock.\n\n-55-\n\nAlso on August 18, 2021, representatives of GS\nGroup held a series of due diligence\nmeetings with representatives of GreenSky in\nAtlanta, including a dinner meeting with\nsenior executives of both firms.\n\nOn August 21,\n2021, representatives of Financial Sponsor D\nsent to representatives of Cravath and J.P.\nMorgan a revised draft of the Financial\nSponsor D merger agreement, which was prepared\nby Financial Sponsor D\u0092s outside counsel.\n\nOn August 23, 2021, at the direction of\nGreenSky\u0092s senior management, representatives\nof J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of GS\nGroup and Financial Sponsor D to request that\neach of GS Group and Financial Sponsor D\nprovide updated written proposals to acquire\nGreenSky on September 3, 2021.\n\nOn August 23, 2021, Mr. Zalik and\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan also had a\ntelephonic meeting with representatives of\nFinancial\nSponsor D to discuss the financing plans\nassociated with Financial Sponsor D\u0092s\npotential acquisition of GreenSky and other\nmatters. During that meeting, Financial\nSponsor D stated that, as part of its\nfinancing plan, it would want both Messrs.\nZalik and Sheft to roll over approximately\n$500 million (approximately $250 million each)\nof proceeds into the post-closing company. Mr.\nZalik stated that he would not engage in a\ndiscussion on the rollover other than to note\nthe\nrequest.\n\nOn August 23, 2021, the GreenSky special\ncommittee also met by videoconference, with\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini\nGoodrich & Rosati P.C. (which we refer to as\n\u0093Wilson Sonsini\u0094) also in attendance. The\nmembers of the GreenSky special committee\nconducted an interview of Wilson Sonsini to\nserve as independent legal advisor to the\nGreenSky\nspecial committee, and in response to\nquestions from the GreenSky special committee,\nthe representatives of Wilson Sonsini\nconfirmed that Wilson Sonsini had no actual or\npotential conflicts of interest with respect\nto a proposed engagement. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed\nwith the GreenSky special committee the\nmembers\u0092 fiduciary duties, the role and\nmandate of the GreenSky special committee,\nstandards of review that can apply to\ndirectors\u0092 decisions under Delaware\nlaw and various process considerations. The\nmembers of the GreenSky special committee also\ndiscussed whether any of the members of the\nGreenSky special committee had any actual or\npotential conflicts of interest with respect\nto a potential\nacquisition of GreenSky, and all three members\nof the GreenSky special committee confirmed\nthat they did not believe that any of their\nrespective relationships would affect their\njudgment in connection with the GreenSky\nspecial committee\u0092s\nprocess. However, Mr. Freishtat indicated\nthat, pending further discussion with the\nspecial committee members and Wilson Sonsini,\nhe would resign from the GreenSky special\ncommittee and advise the GreenSky board\naccordingly given his personal\nrelationship with Mr. Zalik. The GreenSky\nspecial committee also discussed its potential\nengagement of a financial advisor and the\nimportance of engaging a financial advisor\nthat was appropriately qualified and free of\nconflicts of interest.\nAfter discussing the possibility of hiring\nother financial advisors, the GreenSky special\ncommittee noted its potential interest in\nengaging Piper Sandler given Piper Sandler\u0092s\nfamiliarity with GreenSky and its industry,\nits ability to get\nup to speed quickly as a result and certain\nfavorable experiences that certain members of\nthe GreenSky special committee had had with\nthe proposed Piper Sandler team on matters\nunrelated to GreenSky.\n\nFollowing the meeting, the GreenSky special\ncommittee determined to engage Wilson Sonsini\nas its independent legal advisor, and\nMr. Freishtat resigned from the GreenSky\nspecial committee on August 24, 2021.\n\nOn August 25, 2021, representatives of\nS&C sent to representatives of Cravath a\nrevised draft of the GS Group merger\nagreement. Between August 25, 2021 and\nSeptember 14, 2021, representatives of Cravath\nand representatives of S&C engaged in\nnegotiations of the terms of\nthe GS Group merger agreement. During this\ntime and leading up to the signing of the GS\nGroup merger agreement, representatives of\nWilson Sonsini, acting at the direction of the\nGreenSky special committee, provided feedback\non the GS Group merger\nagreement to representatives of Cravath but\ndid not directly participate in negotiations\nwith S&C given that the GS Group proposal did\nnot involve a conflict of interest and on the\nbasis that it could be detrimental to\nnegotiations with GS Group\nif GS Group or its advisors learned of the\nexistence of the GreenSky special committee or\nits advisors, from which it could potentially\ninfer the nature of a competing proposal.\n\n-56-\n\nOn August 25, 2021, representatives of\nFinancial Sponsor D also provided to\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan a proposed term\nsheet for a stockholders agreement related to\nMr. Zalik\u0092s and Mr. Sheft\u0092s proposed rollover\nequity investment in the post-closing company.\nThis term sheet was shared with the\nGreenSky board and the GreenSky special\ncommittee.\n\nOn August 26, 2021, each of Mr. Zalik and Mr.\nSheft delivered a letter\nto the GreenSky special committee confirming,\nconsistent with their prior statements to the\nGreenSky board, that Mr. Zalik and Mr. Sheft,\nrespectively, would not proceed with any\ntransaction with Financial Sponsor D in which\nhe might have\nan interest that is additional to and/or\ndifferent from the interests of GreenSky\u0092s\nunaffiliated stockholders unless (i) such\ntransaction is recommended by the GreenSky\nspecial committee and (ii) such transaction\nwill be subject to a non-waivable condition\nrequiring the approval of GreenSky\u0092s\ndisinterested stockholders in accordance with\nthe framework established under Kahnv.M& F\nWorldwide Corporation\nand its progeny, along with any other\nstockholder approvals required by applicable\nlaw and GreenSky\u0092s governing documents.\n\nOn\nAugust 26, 2021, the GreenSky special\ncommittee also met by video conference with\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. The members of the GreenSky\nspecial committee discussed with Wilson\nSonsini the process for the selection of an\nindependent financial advisor and the\npossibility of engaging Piper Sandler as its\nindependent financial advisor. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini noted that\nthey had spoken with representatives from\nPiper Sandler to explore whether Piper\nSandler had any actual or potential conflicts\nof interest with respect to a proposed\nengagement. The GreenSky special committee\ndiscussed, among other things, Piper Sandler\u0092s\nprior work for GreenSky and the fact that\nPiper Sandler had not had\nany engagements with GreenSky in several\nyears. Following discussion, the GreenSky\nspecial committee determined to engage Piper\nSandler as its independent financial advisor\nafter considering, among other things, Piper\nSandler\u0092s\nqualifications, its past advisory services to\nGreenSky and Piper Sandler\u0092s familiarity with\nGreenSky\u0092s business. The members of the\nGreenSky special committee also discussed with\nthe representatives of Wilson Sonsini the\nprocedures that\nthe GreenSky special committee would adopt to\ngovern the process in connection with a\npotential acquisition of GreenSky.\n\nOn\nAugust 27, 2021, representatives of Cravath\nsent to representatives of Financial Sponsor\nD\u0092s outside counsel a revised draft of the\nFinancial Sponsor D merger agreement. Between\nAugust 27, 2021 and September 8, 2021,\nrepresentatives of Cravath (with input from\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini) and\nrepresentatives of Financial Sponsor D\u0092s\noutside counsel engaged in negotiations of the\nterms of the Financial Sponsor D merger\nagreement.\n\nOn August 27, 2021, at the direction of\nGreenSky senior management, representatives of\nJ.P. Morgan sent to representatives of GS\nGroup\nand representatives of Financial Sponsor D a\ndraft term sheet for the backstop funding\nfacility. Between August 27, 2021 and\nSeptember 14, 2021, representatives of\nGreenSky and representatives of GS Group\nengaged in negotiations of the\nterms of the backstop funding facility term\nsheet. Between August 27, 2021 and September\n8, 2021, representatives of GreenSky and\nrepresentatives of Financial Sponsor D and its\ncounsel engaged in negotiations of the terms\nof the backstop\nfunding facility term sheet.\n\nOn August 29, 2021, the GreenSky special\ncommittee met by video conference, with\nrepresentatives of\nWilson Sonsini and Piper Sandler also in\nattendance. The representatives of Piper\nSandler reviewed with the GreenSky special\ncommittee their initial impressions of\nGreenSky\u0092s sale process to date and discussed\nthe financial projections that had\nbeen prepared by members of GreenSky\u0092s\nmanagement and provided to Piper Sandler. The\nGreenSky special committee also discussed with\nits financial and legal advisors the\nprocedures that the GreenSky special committee\nwould adopt to govern\nthe process in connection with a potential\nacquisition of GreenSky, in order to maximize\nvalue for GreenSky\u0092s unaffiliated\nstockholders. As part of that discussion, the\nGreenSky special committee considered a\nrequest by Mr. Zalik that\nMr. Zalik be permitted to meet with\nrepresentatives of Financial Sponsor D. The\nGreenSky special committee noted its potential\nwillingness to permit such meeting on the\nbasis that, if the meeting were appropriately\nconducted, it could help\nencourage Financial Sponsor D to submit the\nbest bid possible for the unaffiliated\nstockholders.\n\n-57-\n\nOn August 29, 2021, the GreenSky board (except\nfor Mr. Sheft, who had recused\nhimself) also met by videoconference, with\nmembers of senior management and\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan, Cravath,\nTroutman Pepper and Wilson Sonsini also in\nattendance. Mr. Bacci, chair of the GreenSky\nspecial committee, and representatives\nof Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the GreenSky\nboard the work done by the GreenSky special\ncommittee since it had been reconstituted,\nincluding reporting its engagement of Piper\nSandler and that Mr. Freishtat had resigned\nfrom the GreenSky\nspecial committee. The representatives of J.P.\nMorgan reviewed with the GreenSky board the\nlatest developments in GreenSky\u0092s discussions\nwith GS Group and Financial Sponsor D,\nincluding Financial Sponsor D\u0092s financing\nplan. The\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan then discussed\nthe possibility of arranging meetings between\nMr. Zalik and Ms. Cohen and between Mr. Zalik\nand a senior representative of Financial\nSponsor D, in each case to discuss GS Group\u0092s\nand\nFinancial Sponsor D\u0092s respective views with\nrespect to the strategic future of GreenSky\nfollowing its potential acquisition by GS\nGroup or Financial Sponsor D, as applicable.\nThe GreenSky board noted that these meetings\ncould serve the positive\npurpose, in furtherance of achieving the best\nvalue available for stockholders, of having\neach of GS Group and Financial Sponsor D be\nmore enthusiastic about a potential\ntransaction. The representatives of Cravath\nand J.P. Morgan then reviewed\nwith the GreenSky board the proposals from GS\nGroup and Financial Sponsor D to acquire\nGreenSky, including open items therein, the\nform of consideration offered by the proposals\nand whether to seek a \u0093collar\u0094 from GS Group\n(with the\nGreenSky board determining such strategy would\nnot be advisable).\n\nOn August 30, 2021, a representative of\nCravath distributed to\nmembers of the GreenSky board and management,\nas well as representatives of J.P. Morgan,\ncertain procedures adopted by the GreenSky\nspecial committee governing GreenSky\u0092s\nstrategic review process and, specifically,\nwith respect to discussions\nwith GS Group and Financial Sponsor D. Among\nother things, the process guidelines provided\nthat the GreenSky special committee would\ndirect the sale process with Financial Sponsor\nD and be kept informed as to all economic or\nother substantive\ndiscussions or other developments relating to\nany other potential transaction, including the\none with GS Group, and that the committee\nwould further participate in setting the\nstrategy concerning GS Group. The process\nguidelines further directed,\nconsistent with the GreenSky board process to\ndate, that management retention, management\ncompensation and the terms of any rollover of\nGreenSky equity or related matters with\nrespect to any transaction not be negotiated\nor discussed unless\nauthorized by the GreenSky special committee.\n\nOn August 30, 2021, Mr. Bacci, in his capacity\nas chair of the GreenSky special\ncommittee, also spoke with Mr. Zalik regarding\nthe proposed potential meeting between Mr.\nZalik and representatives of Financial Sponsor\nD, particularly relating to the purpose and\nappropriate conduct of any such meeting.\n\nOn August 31, 2021, following further\ndiscussion between Mr. Bacci and Mr. Babbit,\nthe GreenSky special committee agreed that\nMr. Zalik could participate in such a meeting\nand communicated that decision to Mr. Zalik,\nwith the instruction that Mr. Zalik was not\npermitted to discuss at such meeting (i) the\npossibility of a rollover or reinvestment of\nproceeds by Mr. Zalik or any other member of\nmanagement or the GreenSky board, (ii) Mr.\nZalik\u0092s post-acquisition compensation or\npersonal arrangements, or the compensation or\npersonal arrangements of any other member of\nGreenSky\u0092s management or the GreenSky board or\n(iii) any post-acquisition arrangements\nrelating to the governance of the GreenSky\nbusiness or the rights of investors in the\nbusiness. Mr. Zalik agreed to abide by such\ninstruction.\n\nOn August 31, 2021, representatives of S&C\nsent to representatives of Cravath an initial\ndraft of the voting agreement to be entered\ninto by Mr. Zalik and GS Group (which we refer\nto as the \u0093GS Group voting agreement\u0094),\npursuant to which, among other things, Mr.\nZalik and certain of his affiliates would\nagree to vote all of their shares of GreenSky\ncommon\nstock in favor of the GS Group merger\nagreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby; provided that in the event of a\nchange in recommendation by the GreenSky\nboard, the GS Group voting agreement would be\nreduced to 35% of the total voting\npower of GreenSky stockholders. Between August\n31, 2021 and September 14, 2021,\nrepresentatives of Cravath (with input from\nWilson Sonsini), Troutman Pepper and S&C\nengaged in negotiations of the terms of the GS\nGroup voting agreement,\nthe GS Group merger agreement and all other\nrelated documentation.\n\n-58-\n\nOn August 31, 2021, representatives of GS\nGroup also held a series of due diligence\nmeetings with representatives of GreenSky in\nAtlanta, including a dinner meeting between\nMr. Zalik and Ms. Cohen.\n\nOn\nSeptember 1, 2021, as had been authorized by\nthe GreenSky special committee, Mr. Zalik and\na representative of J.P. Morgan met with\nrepresentatives of Financial Sponsor D in\nNantucket, MA, so that Mr. Zalik and the\nrepresentatives of\nFinancial Sponsor D could become better\nacquainted with one another and to discuss\ntheir visions for the GreenSky business.\n\nOn\nSeptember 1, 2021, the GreenSky special\ncommittee also met by video conference, with\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini and Piper\nSandler also in attendance. The GreenSky\nspecial committee discussed with its financial\nand legal advisors the\nmeeting between Mr. Zalik and the\nrepresentatives of Financial Sponsor D, which\nhad concluded earlier in the day. The\nrepresentatives of Piper Sandler reviewed with\nthe GreenSky special committee a sensitivity\nanalysis of certain line items\nfrom GreenSky\u0092s 2021 to 2023 outlook for\nfiscal year 2021 based on actual results\nthrough August 2021, which analysis had been\nprepared by GreenSky senior management, noting\nthat such sensitivity analysis did not alter\nthe overall financial\nexpectations for GreenSky. The sensitivity\nanalysis is described more fully under the\nsection entitled \u0093The Mergers\u0097Certain\nUnaudited Financial Information\u0094 beginning on\npage 73 of this proxy statement/prospectus. At\nthe\nrequest of the committee members, the\nrepresentatives of Piper Sandler also\ndiscussed their views of GreenSky\u0092s strategic\nreview process, noting that given GreenSky\u0092s\nextensive outreach to possible counterparties,\nthe current approach to\nthe process was logical and strong and that\nthe GS Group and Financial Sponsor D were both\nin a position to submit strong bids for\nGreenSky.\n\nOn September 2, 2021, representatives of\nCravath sent to representatives of Financial\nSponsor D\u0092s outside counsel an initial draft\nof the form of Financial Sponsor D voting\nagreement to be entered into by Mr. Zalik, Mr.\nSheft and related entities, pursuant to which,\namong other things, Mr. Zalik, Mr. Sheft and\ncertain of their respective affiliates would\nagree to vote all of their respective shares\nof GreenSky common stock in favor of the\nFinancial Sponsor D merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby; provided\nthat in the event of a change in\nrecommendation by the GreenSky board,\nMr. Zalik\u0092s voting agreement would be reduced\nto 35% of the total voting power of GreenSky\nstockholders and Mr. Sheft\u0092s voting agreement\nwould be terminated. Between September 2, 2021\nand September 8, 2021,\nrepresentatives of Cravath (with input from\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini) and outside\ncounsel to Financial Sponsor D engaged in\nnegotiations of the terms of the Financial\nSponsor D voting agreement, the Financial\nSponsor D merger agreement and\nall other related documentation.\n\nOn September 3, 2021, representatives of\nFinancial Sponsor D\u0092s outside counsel sent\nrepresentatives of Cravath initial drafts of\nthe equity and debt commitment letters for\nFinancial Sponsor D\u0092s financing. Between\nSeptember 3, 2021 and September 8, 2021,\nrepresentatives of Cravath and Financial\nSponsor D\u0092s\noutside counsel engaged in negotiations of the\nterms of the equity commitment and debt\ncommitment letters.\n\nLater on September 3,\n2021, GS Group delivered a revised written\nproposal to acquire GreenSky in an all-stock\ntransaction at an exchange ratio of 0.0277 of\na share of GS Group common stock for each\nshare of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock, which represented a price of\napproximately $11.50 per share of GreenSky\nClass A common stock based upon the closing\ntrading price per share of GS Group common\nstock on September 2, 2021. The proposal\nrequired that no payments\nbe made under the tax receivable agreement in\nconnection with the transaction, and that $200\nmillion of Mr. Zalik\u0092s proceeds from the\ntransaction be held back and released upon\ncompletion of two years of service at GS Group\n(subsequently, the holdback amount was reduced\nto $132 million to reflect the adverse tax\nconsequence to Mr. Zalik in the event of a\nforfeiture of the holdback). It was further\ncontingent on GS Group resolving a certain due\ndiligence item\nprior to signing. GS Group also sent to\nGreenSky revised drafts of the GS Group merger\nagreement and all other related documentation.\n\nOn\nSeptember 3, 2021, Financial Sponsor D also\ndelivered a revised written proposal to\nacquire GreenSky in an all-cash transaction\nfor $11.75 per share of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock. The proposal\nrequired that no\n\n-59-\n\npayments be made under the tax receivable\nagreement in connection with the transaction,\nand that Mr. Zalik and Mr. Sheft each roll\nover $280 million individually ($560 million\nin the aggregate) of proceeds, with the\nremainder of the financing to come in the form\nof equity and debt commitments from an\naffiliate of Financial Sponsor D. The proposal\ndid not include a financing condition.\nFinancial Sponsor D also sent to\nGreenSky revised drafts of the Financial\nSponsor D merger agreement and all other\nrelated documentation, including revised\ndrafts of the equity and debt commitment\nletters for Financial Sponsor D\u0092s financing.\n\nOn September 4, 2021, the GreenSky special\ncommittee met by video conference with\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini and Piper\nSandler\nalso in attendance. The GreenSky special\ncommittee discussed with its financial and\nlegal advisors the written proposals that\nGreenSky received from GS Group and Financial\nSponsor D to acquire GreenSky. The financial\nand legal advisors reviewed the\nkey terms of each of the proposals, and Piper\nSandler shared a preliminary analysis with\nrespect to valuation. The GreenSky special\ncommittee discussed with its financial and\nlegal advisors potential next steps in\nGreenSky\u0092s sale process,\nincluding strategies and timing for soliciting\neven more competitive bids from the\ncounterparties. The GreenSky special committee\nadditionally discussed the appropriate timing\nfor permitting further discussions relating to\na potential rollover\nbetween Financial Sponsor D and the relevant\nstockholders, and the committee members also\ndetermined that it would be appropriate to\npermit Mr. Sheft, who remained recused in all\nrespects from GreenSky\u0092s process, to receive\nthe details\nrelating to Financial Sponsor D\u0092s bid, while\nnoting that he would not receive any details\nrelating to the bid from the GS Group.\n\nOn\nSeptember 5, 2021, the GreenSky board (except\nfor Mr. Sheft who had recused himself) met\ntelephonically, with members of senior\nmanagement and representatives of J.P. Morgan,\nCravath, Troutman Pepper, Wilson Sonsini and\nPiper Sandler also\nin attendance, to discuss the September 3,\n2021 proposals received from each of GS Group\nand Financial Sponsor D. The representatives\nof J.P. Morgan reviewed the key terms of both\nproposals, as well as the public process\nGreenSky undertook in\n2019-2020 and the then-current process in 2021\nto sell GreenSky. The representatives of\nCravath reviewed the key differences in legal\nterms proposed by GS Group and Financial\nSponsor D in the draft documentation they had\nsubmitted with their\nproposals (including as to any potential\nvoting agreement). Mr. Benjamin reviewed with\nthe GreenSky board the terms of the backstop\nfunding facility term sheets that had been\nnegotiated to date. The representatives of\nJ.P. Morgan then reviewed\ncertain preliminary financial information and\nanalyses with respect to GreenSky and each of\nthe proposals from GS Group and Financial\nSponsor D and a sensitivity analysis of\ncertain line items from GreenSky\u0092s 2021 to\n2023 outlook for fiscal\nyear 2021 based on actual results through\nAugust 2021, which analysis had been prepared\nby GreenSky senior management. The sensitivity\nanalysis is described more fully under the\nsection entitled \u0093The Mergers\u0097Certain\nUnaudited Financial Information\u0094 beginning on\npage 73 of this proxy statement/prospectus.\n\nThereafter, the GreenSky board and\nrepresentatives of the\nfinancial and legal advisors discussed the two\nproposals and next steps, noting, among other\nthings, the viability of both proposals and\ncomparing the all-stock versus\nall-cash nature of the bids. The GreenSky\nboard again noted the lack of a \u0093collar\u0094 in\nthe GS Group proposal, but determined that the\ncurrency offered by the proposal was strong\nand that,\nstrategically, it was preferable to focus on\nimproving the highest exchange ratio available\nrather than price protection. The GreenSky\nboard, following discussion with\nrepresentatives of the financial and legal\nadvisors, determined that, given how\nclose the two proposals were on value,\nGreenSky solicit \u0093best and final\u0094 bids due on\nthe evening of September 8, 2021.\n\nThe\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan also noted that\nagreement on rollover terms was a requirement\nto Financial Sponsor D\u0092s bid and that such\nnegotiations had not yet commenced as Mr.\nZalik and Mr. Sheft were awaiting\nauthorization from the\nGreenSky special committee before engaging in\nthose discussions. The representatives of J.P.\nMorgan also noted that the GS Group proposal\nstill contemplated that Mr. Zalik would\nsubject $200 million of his proceeds to a\nholdback\narrangement and employment agreement, which\nwas also awaiting discussion and negotiation.\nMr. Zalik indicated that although he and the\nGreenSky board were focused on obtaining the\nbest value achievable for the public\nstockholders, both bidders\nwere asking for concessions from\n\n-60-\n\nhim and, unless he knew what the terms of\nthose arrangements would be, he would not be\nable to confirm to the GreenSky board on\nSeptember 8, 2021 if he would be able to\nsupport either\nwinning bidder. Noting that it would not be\npractical or beneficial to continue to defer\nthese discussions until after a winning bidder\nwas selected, the GreenSky board expressed its\nview, subject to further discussion by and\napproval of the\nGreenSky special committee, that Mr. Zalik be\nauthorized to engage in discussions with GS\nGroup regarding the terms of the holdback\nagreement and his future role with GS Group\nand with Financial Sponsor D regarding the\nterms of his rollover\nequity investment and future role in GreenSky\nfollowing its potential acquisition by\nFinancial Sponsor D, but not, in either case,\nto discuss any of the proposed transaction\nterms of either party\u0092s proposals, such as\nprice per share.\nMr. Zalik agreed to these parameters. Pending\nthe decision of the GreenSky special\ncommittee, the GreenSky board also expressed\nits view that Mr. Sheft should be permitted to\nengage in those same discussions with only\nFinancial Sponsor D,\nand to discuss rollover terms with Mr. Zalik.\nHowever, the GreenSky board noted that Mr.\nSheft should not be told any information\nregarding GS Group\u0092s proposal.\n\nOn September 5, 2021, the GreenSky special\ncommittee also met by video conference, with\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini and Piper\nSandler also in attendance. The GreenSky\nspecial committee discussed with its financial\nand legal advisors the acquisition proposals\nreceived from GS Group and Financial Sponsor\nD, the key differences between the proposals\nand potential next steps\nand strategy for GreenSky\u0092s sale process. The\nGreenSky special committee received from and\ndiscussed with Piper Sandler additional\nfinancial analysis with respect to the\nproposals. The GreenSky special committee also\ndiscussed certain requests\nmade by Mr. Zalik and Mr. Sheft to engage in\ndiscussions with Financial Sponsor D regarding\nthe terms of their respective rollover equity\ninvestments and future roles in GreenSky\nfollowing its potential acquisition by\nFinancial Sponsor D.\nFollowing discussion, and after considering,\namong other things, GreenSky\u0092s competitive\nsale process, the proposed timeline for the\npotential transaction and the value of each of\nthe GS Group and Financial Sponsor D offers,\nthe GreenSky special\ncommittee determined that it would be in the\nbest interest of GreenSky\u0092s unaffiliated\nstockholders to authorize Mr. Zalik and Mr.\nSheft to engage in those discussions with\nFinancial Sponsor D. The GreenSky special\ncommittee also\ndiscussed and expressed its ongoing agreement\nwith the strategy that was developed at the\nGreenSky board meeting held earlier in the\nday.\n\nAlso on September 5, 2021, at a special\nmeeting of the board of directors of GS Bank\n(which we refer to as the \u0093GS Bank\nboard\u0094), held via videoconference, members of\nGS Group and GS Bank management and other\nsenior leaders discussed with the GS Bank\nboard, and answered its questions regarding,\nvarious matters relating to the proposed\nmergers and other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, including the strategic rationale\ntherefor, the negotiations that had taken\nplace, the merger consideration to be paid by\nGS Group and other key terms of the merger\nagreement and related agreements.\nAfter discussion, the GS Bank board\nunanimously determined that it was advisable\nand in the best interests of GS Bank to: (i)\napprove and authorize the proposed mergers and\nother transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, including\nentry by GS Bank into the merger agreement and\nother transaction documents, and any and all\nrelated actions contemplated thereby, subject\nto approval of the proposed mergers and other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement by the GS Group\nboard; and (ii) delegate to the chair of GS\nBank\u0092s board and GS Bank\u0092s chief executive\nofficer joint authority to take any and all\nactions in connection with the proposed\nmergers and other transactions contemplated by\nthe merger\nagreement that the GS Bank board could take,\nincluding without limitation to approve\nmaterial changes to the terms of the\ntransaction documents presented to the GS Bank\nboard at the meeting, and to approve the final\nmerger consideration up to a\ncertain amount.\n\nAlso on September 5, 2021, at a special\nmeeting of the GS Group board, held via\nvideoconference, members of GS Group\nmanagement and other senior leaders discussed\nwith the GS Group board, and answered its\nquestions regarding, various matters relating\nto the proposed mergers and other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement,\nincluding the strategic\nrationale therefor, the negotiations that had\ntaken place, the merger consideration to be\npaid by GS Group and other key terms of the\nmerger agreement and related agreements. After\ndiscussion and taking into account the factors\ndescribed below\nunder \u0093\u0097GS Group\u0092s Reasons for the Mergers\u0094,\nthe GS Group board unanimously determined that\nit was advisable and in the best interests of\nGS Group and its stockholders to: (i) approve\nand authorize the proposed\nmergers and other transactions contemplated by\nthe\n\n-61-\n\nmerger agreement, including entry by GS Group\ninto the merger agreement and other\ntransaction documents, and any and all related\nactions contemplated thereby, subject to\napproval by the GS Group\nspecial transaction committee (as defined\nbelow) of the final merger consideration and\nmaterial changes to the proposed mergers and\nother transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, if any; (ii) approve and authorize\nthe issuance of GS\nGroup common stock as merger consideration,\nincluding the taking of any and all actions\nrelated thereto; and (iii) establish a special\ncommittee of the GS Group board (which we\nrefer to as the \u0093GS Group special transaction\ncommittee\u0094)\nwith the authority to take any and all actions\nin connection with the proposed mergers and\nother transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement that the GS Group board could take,\nincluding without limitation to approve\nmaterial changes or\namendments to the terms and conditions of the\ntransaction documents presented to the GS\nGroup board and to approve the final merger\nconsideration up to a certain amount.\n\nLater on September 5, 2021, at the direction\nof the GreenSky board, representatives of J.P.\nMorgan contacted representatives of GS Group\nand Financial Sponsor D to request that each\nof GS Group and Financial Sponsor D provide\nupdated \u0093best and final\u0094 written proposals to\nacquire GreenSky no later than September 8,\n2021.\n\nOn September 8, 2021, the GreenSky special\ncommittee met by video conference, with\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini and Piper\nSandler\nalso in attendance. The GreenSky special\ncommittee discussed with its financial and\nlegal advisors the upcoming deadline for \u0093best\nand final\u0094 acquisition proposals from\nFinancial Sponsor D and GS Group and the\nGreenSky special\ncommittee\u0092s strategy for addressing various\npotential outcomes that could arise following\nthe submission of those proposals.\n\nSubsequently, on September 8, 2021, the chair\nof the GS Bank board and GS Bank\u0092s chief\nexecutive officer approved material changes\nto the merger agreement, which changes aligned\nwith the final terms of the mergers and other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, including the increase in the\nmerger consideration, in each case ultimately\napproved by the GS Group\nspecial transaction committee as described\nbelow.\n\nLater on September 8, 2021, GS Group delivered\na revised written proposal to\nacquire GreenSky in an all-stock transaction\nat an exchange ratio of 0.03 shares of GS\nGroup common stock for each share of GreenSky\nClass A common stock, which represented a\nprice of approximately $12.15\nper share based upon the closing trading price\nper share of GS Group common stock on\nSeptember 8, 2021, and prices of $12.35 and\n$12.40 per share of GreenSky Class A common\nstock, respectively, based on the five- and\n10-day volume-weighted average price of GS\nGroup common stock measured from September 8,\n2021. The proposal remained contingent on GS\nGroup resolving a certain due diligence item\nprior to signing. GS Group also\nsent to GreenSky revised drafts of the GS\nGroup merger agreement and all other related\ndocumentation.\n\nOn September 8, 2021,\nFinancial Sponsor D also delivered a revised\nwritten proposal to acquire GreenSky in an\nall-cash transaction for $12.00 per share of\nGreenSky Class A common stock. Financial\nSponsor D also sent revised\ndrafts of the Financial Sponsor D merger\nagreement and all other related documentation.\n\nOn September 9, 2021, the GreenSky board\n(except for Mr. Sheft, who had recused\nhimself) met telephonically, with members of\nsenior management and representatives of J.P.\nMorgan, Cravath, Troutman Pepper, Wilson\nSonsini and Piper Sandler also in attendance,\nto discuss the revised\nwritten proposals received from each of GS\nGroup and Financial Sponsor D. The\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan and Cravath\nreviewed with the GreenSky board the\ndifferences in the key financial and legal\nterms, respectively, of the proposals. The\nGreenSky board then discussed with the\nfinancial and legal advisors the proposals,\nincluding the pros and cons of an all-stock\ntransaction compared to an all-cash\ntransaction, the possibility of securing a\n\u0093collar\u0094 (with the GreenSky board continuing\nto conclude that it was preferable to focus on\nachieving the best exchange ratio possible)\nand the diligence item that remained a\ncondition to signing\nfor GS Group. Mr. Zalik reiterated that he was\nwilling to accept either GS Group\u0092s proposed\nretention holdback or Financial Sponsor D\u0092s\nproposed rollover to facilitate a transaction\nwith either party, even though he believed the\nterms\nof the retention holdback or rollover put him\nat a disadvantage relative to GreenSky\u0092s\npublic stockholders. Following the discussion,\nthe\n\n-62-\n\nGreenSky board concluded that if GS Group were\nwilling to remove as a pre-signing condition\nthe resolution of a certain due diligence item\nby the end of\nthat day, then GreenSky should move forward\nwith GS Group to finalize documentation in the\ncoming days. Pending resolution of this\ndiligence matter, the GreenSky board\nauthorized management to agree to exclusivity\nwith GS Group for a period\nsufficient to allow the parties to enter into\ndefinitive documentation, which was expected\nto occur within several days.\n\nThe GreenSky\nboard then discussed whether it made sense to\nkeep the GreenSky special committee in place\ngiven that the GreenSky board intended to\nproceed with a transaction with GS Group,\nwhich did not involve differential beneficial\nconsideration or other\nissues that motivated the formation of the\nGreenSky special committee in connection with\nthe Financial Sponsor D proposal. After\ndiscussion among the GreenSky board and the\nfinancial and legal advisors, the GreenSky\nboard concluded that the GreenSky\nspecial committee should continue to meet and\nmake a recommendation to the GreenSky board\nprior to final approval of any transaction.\n\nOn\nSeptember 9, 2021, the GreenSky special\ncommittee also met by video conference, with\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini, Piper\nSandler, Cravath and J.P. Morgan also in\nattendance. The GreenSky special committee\ndiscussed with the financial and\nlegal advisors present the revised proposals\nreceived from each of GS Group and Financial\nSponsor D, the key features of each proposal\nand the diligence item that remained a\ncondition to signing for GS Group. The\nGreenSky special committee reviewed\nwith the financial and legal advisors present\nGreenSky\u0092s strategy for addressing each of the\nproposals, and following discussion, the\nGreenSky special committee concurred with the\nstrategy described at the meeting of the\nGreenSky board, which\nwas held immediately prior to the meeting.\n\nFollowing the GreenSky special committee\nmeeting on September 9, 2021, at the direction\nof the GreenSky board, representatives of J.P.\nMorgan informed representatives of GS Group\nthat GreenSky was prepared to move forward\nwith them contingent upon GS Group agreeing to\nremove as a pre-signing\ncondition the resolution of a certain due\ndiligence item by the end of the day. During\nthe course of that day, GS Group determined\nthat such a pre-signing condition would not be\nneeded and agreed to do so.\nThereafter, representatives of Cravath sent to\nrepresentatives of S&C an initial draft of an\nexclusivity agreement. Between September 9,\n2021 and September 10, 2021, representatives\nof Cravath and S&C negotiated the terms of the\nexclusivity agreement, which was entered into\nby GS Group and GreenSky on September 10,\n2021, and provided for an exclusivity period\nthrough September 14, 2021.\n\nOn September 10, 2021, the GreenSky board\n(except for Mr. Sheft, who had recused\nhimself) met telephonically, with members of\nsenior\nmanagement and representatives of J.P. Morgan,\nCravath, Troutman Pepper, Wilson Sonsini and\nPiper Sandler also in attendance, to discuss\nthe timetable for entering into definitive\ndocumentation with GS Group. The GreenSky\nboard determined to target\nsigning at the end of the day on September 14,\n2021 after market close and to announce a\ntransaction on the morning of September 15\nbefore the market opened.\n\nOn September 10, 2021, the GreenSky special\ncommittee also met by video conference, with\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini, Piper\nSandler, Cravath and J.P. Morgan also in\nattendance. The GreenSky special committee\ncontinued the discussion from the meeting of\nthe GreenSky board that occurred immediately\nprior to the meeting and solicited views from\nthe financial and legal\nadvisors present regarding the timetable for\nentering into definitive documentation with GS\nGroup. The GreenSky special committee and the\nadvisors present discussed the proposed\ncommunication strategy concerning Financial\nSponsor D.\n\nBetween September 10, 2021 and September 14,\n2021, representatives of GreenSky and GS Group\nand their respective legal advisors\nprepared agreed forms of the transaction\ndocumentation for the requisite review by the\napplicable governing bodies of GreenSky and GS\nGroup.\n\nOn September 11, 2021, a representative of\nCravath, acting at the direction of the\nGreenSky board, had a telephone conversation\nwith\nMr. Sheft during which Mr. Sheft was provided\nan update on the process to date,\n\n-63-\n\nincluding that the GreenSky board had selected\nGS Group as the winning bidder and was\ntargeting a signing of a definitive agreement\nwith GS Group on September 14, 2021. In that\ndiscussion,\nMr. Sheft stated that since he had been\nrecused from the process for the past several\nweeks, he thought it prudent to continue to\nrecuse himself for the remainder of the\nGreenSky board\u0092s deliberative process,\nincluding any GreenSky board\ncommittee meetings with respect thereto.\n\nOn September 14, 2021, representatives of J.P.\nMorgan hosted a\ntelephonic meeting with representatives of GS\nGroup in order for GreenSky and\nrepresentatives of its financial and legal\nadvisors to perform reverse due diligence on\nGS Group.\n\nOn September 14, 2021, the GreenSky special\ncommittee also met by video conference, with\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini, Piper\nSandler\nand Cravath also in attendance. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed\nwith the GreenSky special committee their\nfiduciary duties and standards of judicial\nreview that can apply to directors\u0092 decisions\nunder Delaware law. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini described\nthe purpose of the GreenSky special committee\nand its role in connection with GreenSky\u0092s\nevaluation of the proposal put forth by GS\nGroup to acquire GreenSky. It was noted that\nalthough the GS Group\nproposal did not involve the type of different\nor additional interest that gave rise to the\nestablishment of the GreenSky special\ncommittee, given the GreenSky special\ncommittee\u0092s intensive involvement on behalf of\nGreenSky\u0092s unaffiliated\nstockholders, and the GreenSky special\ncommittee\u0092s work in comparing the GS Group\nproposal with the proposal by Financial\nSponsor D to acquire GreenSky, it was\nproposed, as had been discussed with the\nGreenSky special committee members leading\nup to the meeting, that the GreenSky special\ncommittee formally determine whether to\nrecommend the GS Group proposal to the\nGreenSky board.\n\nThe representatives from Piper Sandler\nreviewed their valuation analysis with the\nGreenSky special committee. The\nrepresentatives of Piper\nSandler described, among other things, the\nstructure and key features of the proposed\nacquisition of GreenSky by GS Group, Piper\nSandler\u0092s valuation analysis of GreenSky and\nGS Group, the historic stock performance of\nGreenSky and GS Group and\nhow GreenSky\u0092s tax receivable agreement had\nbeen taken into account in Piper Sandler\u0092s\nvaluation of GreenSky and the proposed\ntransaction. The representatives of Piper\nSandler noted their conclusion that the merger\nconsideration to be paid\nto the holders of GreenSky\u0092s Class A common\nstock in connection with the proposed\nacquisition of GreenSky by GS Group was fair,\nfrom a financial point of view, to such\nholders. The representatives of Piper Sandler\nfurther noted that they\nwould deliver a written opinion to the\nGreenSky special committee reflecting that\nconclusion.\n\nThe members of the GreenSky special\ncommittee engaged in a discussion regarding\nwhether the GreenSky special committee was\nsupportive of the proposed acquisition of\nGreenSky by GS Group and whether the GreenSky\nspecial committee was prepared to recommend\nsuch transaction to the\nGreenSky board. Following discussion, the\nGreenSky special committee unanimously\nresolved that the proposed acquisition of\nGreenSky by GS Group was in the best interests\nof GreenSky and GreenSky stockholders,\nincluding its unaffiliated stockholders,\nand to recommend that the GreenSky board\napprove the transaction.\n\nLater on September 14, 2021, the GreenSky\nboard (except for\nMr. Sheft, who had recused himself) met\ntelephonically, with members of senior\nmanagement and representatives of J.P. Morgan,\nCravath, Troutman Pepper, Wilson Sonsini and\nPiper Sandler also in attendance, to review\nand potentially approve the\nexecution of the GS Group merger agreement and\nthe other transactions contemplated thereby.\nThe representatives of Cravath reviewed with\nthe GreenSky board an updated letter provided\nby J.P. Morgan disclosing its prior\nrelationships with GreenSky\nand GS Group. Thereafter, the representatives\nof Cravath reviewed with the GreenSky board\ntheir fiduciary duties in the context of the\ntransaction with GS Group and the legal terms\nof the GS Group merger agreement and related\nagreements, noting the\nterms were substantially the same as those\npreviously reviewed with the GreenSky board\nand reporting that all such documents were in\nagreed form. The representatives of J.P.\nMorgan then reviewed J.P. Morgan\u0092s financial\nanalyses of the exchange\nratio and, following discussion, rendered to\nthe GreenSky board J.P. Morgan\u0092s oral opinion,\nwhich was subsequently confirmed in writing,\nto the effect that, as of September 14, 2021\nand based upon and subject to the factors and\nvarious\nassumptions made,\n\n-64-\n\nprocedures followed, matters considered, and\nlimitations and qualifications on the review\nundertaken as described in the opinion, the\nexchange ratio in the proposed company merger\nwas fair, from a financial point of view, to\nthe holders of the GreenSky Class A common\nstock. For more information, see the section\nentitled \u0093 The Mergers\u0097Opinion of J.P. Morgan,\nGreenSky\u0092s Financial Advisor\u0094 beginning on\npage 76 of this proxy statement/prospectus and\nAnnex B to this proxy statement/prospectus.\nThe GreenSky board engaged in a discussion\nregarding the transaction with GS Group and\nthe benefits it afforded to GreenSky and its\nstockholders. Mr. Bacci, in his capacity as\nChair of the GreenSky special committee,\ndelivered the GreenSky special committee\u0092s\nrecommendation that the GreenSky board should\napprove the transaction with GS Group. The\nGreenSky board then recessed and the members\nof the Compensation Committee convened and\nunanimously approved the treatment of GreenSky\nequity awards as provided for in the GS Group\nmerger agreement and recommended that the\nGreenSky board submit to the stockholders of\nGreenSky a non-binding,advisory proposal to\napprove the compensation that may be paid or\nbecome payable to GreenSky\u0092s named executive\nofficers in connection with the mergers and\nrecommend to such stockholders the approval of\nsuch proposal. Thereafter, the GreenSky board\nreconvened and (i) determined that it was in\nthe best interests of GreenSky and its\nstockholders, and declared it advisable, that\nGreenSky enter into the GS Group merger\nagreement and related agreements and\nconsummate the transactions contemplated\nthereby, (ii) approved and adopted the GS\nGroup merger agreement and the other\ntransaction documents (including the GS Group\nvoting agreement), (iii) adopted resolutions\nrecommending that GreenSky stockholders vote\nfor the approval of the GS Group merger\nagreement and (iv) directed that the GS Group\nmerger agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby be submitted to GreenSky\nstockholders for adoption. Also on September\n14, 2021, the GS Group special transaction\ncommittee met in person to review the final\nterms of the mergers and other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement,\nincluding the increase in the merger\nconsideration. After discussion, the GS Group\nspecial transaction committee determined that\nit was advisable and in the best interests of\nGS Group and its stockholders to: (i) approve\nthe final terms and conditions of the mergers\nand other transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement, including the final merger\nconsideration; and (ii) authorize GS Group to\nproceed with the mergers and other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement as had been approved by the GS Group\nboard at its September 5, 2021 meeting.\nFollowing the conclusion of the GreenSky board\nmeeting and the GS Group special transaction\ncommittee meeting, the parties executed and\ndelivered the GS Group merger agreement and\nrelated agreements after market close on\nSeptember 14, 2021. On September 15, prior to\nthe opening of trading on NASDAQ and NYSE, the\nparties issued a joint press release\nannouncing the transaction. GS Group\u0092s Reasons\nfor the Mergers In reaching its decision to\napprove the merger agreement, the mergers and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement, the GS Group board consulted\nwith GS Group management, who were advised by\nGS Group\u0092s financial advisor, Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC, and outside legal counsel, and\nconsidered a number of factors. GS Group\u0092s\nreasons for the mergers include the following:\n                                              \n      its knowledge of GreenSky\u0092s business,    \n      operations, financial condition, asset  \n      quality, earnings and                   \n      prospects, taking into account the      \n      results of GS Group\u0092s due diligence      \n      review of GreenSky;

In\naddition, as described in the section entitled\n\u0093 \u0097Background of the Transactions\u0094, the GS\nBank board separately evaluated the mergers,\nheld a number of meetings and consulted with\nmembers of GS Group and GS Bank management and\nother senior leaders in reaching its decision\nto approve the merger agreement, the mergers\nand the other transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement. It should be noted that this\nexplanation of GS Group\u0092s reasoning and all\nother information presented in this section is\nforward-looking in nature, and therefore\nshould be read in light of the factors\ndiscussed under the heading \u0093 Cautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements\u0094 beginning on page 28. GreenSky\u0092s\nReasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of the\nGreenSky Board of Directors At a meeting held\non September 14, 2021, the GreenSky board,\nacting upon the unanimous recommendation of\nthe GreenSky special committee, (i) determined\nthat it was in the best interests of GreenSky\nand its stockholders and declared it advisable\nthat GreenSky enter into the merger agreement\nand other related agreements and consummate\nthe transactions contemplated thereby, (ii)\napproved and adopted the merger agreement and\nother related agreements, (iii) resolved to\nrecommend that GreenSky stockholders vote for\nthe adoption of the merger agreement and (iv)\ndirected that the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby be submitted\nto GreenSky stockholders for adoption.

In\naddition, the GreenSky special committee\nseparately evaluated the mergers, held a\nnumber of meetings and consulted with and\nreceived the advice of representatives of the\nGreenSky special committee\u0092s outside legal\ncounsel and financial advisor.

The\nGreenSky board realized that there can be no\nassurance about future results, including\nresults considered or expected as disclosed in\nthe foregoing reasons. In addition, the\nGreenSky board was aware of and considered the\ninterests of its directors and executive\nofficers that may be different from, or in\naddition to, the interests of GreenSky\nstockholders generally when approving and\nadopting the merger agreement and recommending\nthat GreenSky stockholders vote to approve the\nGreenSky merger proposal. For more\ninformation, see the section entitled \u0093 The\nMergers\u0097Interests of GreenSky\u0092s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Mergers\u0094 beginning\non page 94 of this proxy statement. The\nforegoing discussion of the information and\nfactors that the GreenSky board and the\nGreenSky special committee considered is not\nintended to be exhaustive, but is meant to\ninclude the material factors regarding the\ntransaction that the GreenSky board and the\nGreenSky special committee considered, which\nare not necessarily presented in order of\nrelative importance. In light of the\ncomplexity and wide variety of factors that\nthe GreenSky board and the GreenSky special\ncommittee considered, the GreenSky board and\nthe GreenSky special committee did not find it\npractical to, and did not attempt to,\nquantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or\nspecific weights or values to any of the\nfactors considered and did not undertake to\nmake any specific determinations as to whether\nany particular factor, or any aspect of any\nparticular factor, was favorable or\nunfavorable to the ultimate determination of\nthe GreenSky board or the GreenSky special\ncommittee, as applicable. Rather, the GreenSky\nboard and the GreenSky special committee each\nmade its recommendation based on the totality\nof the information available to the GreenSky\nboard and the GreenSky special committee, as\napplicable. In addition, individual members of\nthe GreenSky board and the GreenSky special\ncommittee may have given different weights to\ndifferent factors. The foregoing description\nof the GreenSky board\u0092s and the GreenSky\nspecial committee\u0092s consideration of the\nfactors supporting the mergers is forward-\nlooking in nature. This information should be\nread in light of the factors discussed in the\nsection entitled \u0093 Cautionary Statement\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements\u0094\nbeginning on page 28 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. ACCORDINGLY, THE\nGREENSKY BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT HOLDERS OF\nGREENSKY COMMON STOCK VOTE \u0093FOR\u0094 THE GREENSKY\nMERGER PROPOSAL, \u0093FOR\u0094 THE NON-\nBINDINGCOMPENSATION PROPOSAL AND \u0093FOR\u0094 THE\nADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL. -72-\n\nCertain Unaudited Financial Information\n\nAlthough GreenSky has periodically issued\nlimited financial guidance to investors,\nGreenSky does not as a matter of course\npublicly disclose financial forecasts or\nprojections as to future results of its\noperations due to, among other reasons, the\nuncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity\nof the underlying assumptions and estimates.\nHowever, in July 2021, as part\nof the development of GreenSky\u0092s long-term\nplan and in connection with GreenSky\u0092s review\nof strategic alternatives, including a\npotential sale of GreenSky, GreenSky\u0092s senior\nmanagement prepared certain unaudited\nprospective financial\ninformation for fiscal years 2021 through 2023\n(the \u0093GreenSky 2021-2023 outlook\u0094). The\nGreenSky 2021-2023 outlook was provided to the\nGreenSky board, the GreenSky special\ncommittee, J.P. Morgan, Piper Sandler and\ncertain third parties\npotentially interested in a transaction with\nGreenSky, including GS Group and Financial\nSponsor D. In August 2021, in connection with\nGS Group\u0092s and Financial Sponsor D\u0092s\nrespective due diligence processes, GreenSky\nsenior management\nprepared a sensitivity analysis of certain\nline items from the GreenSky 2021-2023 outlook\nfor fiscal year 2021 based on actual results\nthrough August 2021 and a range of full-year\ntransaction volumes (the \u0093GreenSky 2021\nupdate/sensitivity\nanalysis\u0094). The GreenSky 2021\nupdate/sensitivity analysis was provided to\nthe GreenSky board, the GreenSky special\ncommittee, J.P. Morgan, Piper Sandler, GS\nGroup and Financial Sponsor D. Based on the\nGreenSky 2021-2023 outlook and certain\nassumptions provided by GreenSky senior\nmanagement, J.P. Morgan and Piper Sandler\nextrapolated certain unaudited prospective\nfinancial information of GreenSky for fiscal\nyears 2024 and 2025, which extrapolations were\napproved for use by J.P. Morgan\nand Piper Sandler by GreenSky senior\nmanagement (such extrapolations, together with\nthe GreenSky 2021-2023 outlook, (solely with\nrespect to Piper Sandler\u0092s opinion and\nfinancial analyses) the GreenSky 2021\nupdate/sensitivity analysis and\n(solely with respect to J.P. Morgan\u0092s opinion\nand financial analyses) the GreenSky unlevered\nfree cash flows (as defined below),\ncollectively, the \u0093GreenSky forecasts\u0094). The\nGreenSky board (in the case of J.P. Morgan),\nthe GreenSky\nspecial committee (in the case of Piper\nSandler) and GreenSky senior management,\nauthorized and directed J.P. Morgan and Piper\nSandler, as applicable, to use and rely on the\nGreenSky forecasts in connection with their\nrespective financial analyses\nand opinions, to the extent applicable, as\ndescribed in the sections entitled \u0093The\nMergers\u0097Opinion of J.P. Morgan, GreenSky\u0092s\nFinancial Advisor\u0094 and \u0093The Mergers\u0097Opinion of\nPiper Sandler, GreenSky Special Committee\u0092s\nFinancial Advisor\u0094 beginning on pages 76 and\n82, respectively, of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nThe GreenSky\nforecasts are presented in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus solely to give GreenSky\nstockholders access to the information that\nwas made available to the GreenSky board, the\nGreenSky special committee, their respective\nfinancial advisors and certain\nthird parties potentially interested in a\ntransaction with GreenSky, including GS Group\nand Financial Sponsor D, to the extent\ndescribed above. GS Group\u0092s internal financial\nforecasts were not provided to GreenSky, J.P.\nMorgan or Piper Sandler,\ngiven that GreenSky stockholders were expected\nto own less than [\u0097]% of the outstanding GS\nGroup common stock following the consummation\nof the mergers and the existence of a material\nliquid market for GS Group common stock.\nAccordingly, no\ninternal GS Group forecasts were relied upon\nby the GreenSky board or the GreenSky special\ncommittee in their respective evaluations of\nthe mergers or by J.P. Morgan or Piper Sandler\nfor purposes of their respective financial\nanalyses and fairness\nopinions.\n\nThe GreenSky forecasts were not prepared with\na view toward public disclosure or with a view\ntoward complying with GAAP, the\npublished guidelines of the SEC regarding\nprojections or the guidelines established by\nthe American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for the preparation and\npresentation of prospective financial\ninformation. The GreenSky forecasts included\nherein were prepared by, and are the\nresponsibility of, GreenSky\u0092s management.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited,\nreviewed, examined, compiled nor applied\nagreed-upon procedures with respect to the\nGreenSky forecasts and, accordingly,\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an\nopinion or any other form of assurance with\nrespect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers\nLLP report incorporated herein by reference\nrelates to GreenSky\u0092s previously issued\nfinancial statements. The\nreport does not extend to the GreenSky\nforecasts and should not be read to do so.\n\n-73-\n\nThe GreenSky forecasts are subjective in many\nrespects and thus subject to interpretation.\nWhile presented with numerical specificity,\nthe GreenSky forecasts reflect numerous\nestimates and assumptions made by GreenSky\nsenior management at the time such prospective\nfinancial information was prepared that are\ndifficult to predict and that\nare beyond GreenSky\u0092s control and are subject\nto change. Specifically, the GreenSky\n2021-2023 outlook was prepared by GreenSky\nsenior management at the direction of the\nGreenSky board to include only those existing\nGreenSky revenue streams\ndeemed proven, and thus did not incorporate\nfuture revenues and related costs associated\nwith financial products and lines of business\ncontemplated to be launched in the future. The\nassumptions and estimates underlying the\nGreenSky forecasts are\ninherently uncertain and are subject to a wide\nvariety of significant business, economic,\ncompetitive and other risks and uncertainties\nthat could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those contained in the\nGreenSky forecasts, including,\namong others, risks and uncertainties relating\nto GreenSky\u0092s business (including its ability\nto achieve strategic goals, objectives and\ntargets over applicable periods); industry\nperformance; the regulatory and competitive\nenvironment; general\nglobal business and economic conditions and\nother matters described in the sections\nentitled \u0093Cautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements\u0094 and \u0093Risk Factors\u0094\nbeginning on pages 28 and 30, respectively,\nof this proxy statement/prospectus and Part I,\nItem 1A in GreenSky\u0092s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2020, which is incorporated by reference into\nthis\nproxy statement/prospectus. Some or all of the\nestimates and assumptions underlying the\nGreenSky forecasts may have changed since the\ndate the GreenSky forecasts were prepared.\n\nAccordingly, GreenSky cannot assure readers\nthat the GreenSky forecasts are necessarily\npredictive of the future performance of\nGreenSky, and\nactual results will likely vary from those\npresented in such prospective financial\ninformation and such variances may be\nmaterial. Additionally, the GreenSky forecasts\ncover a number of years into the future and\nsuch information by its nature\nbecomes less predictive with each successive\nyear. The inclusion of the GreenSky forecasts\nin this proxy statement/prospectus should not\nbe regarded as a representation by any person\nthat the results contained in the GreenSky\nforecasts would be\nachieved or that the results achieved would\nnot exceed those reflected in the GreenSky\nforecasts, if the transaction is not\nconsummated.\n\nThe GreenSky forecasts were developed for\nGreenSky on a stand-alone basis without giving\neffect to the transaction or entry into the\nmerger\nagreement, including any potential synergies\nthat may be achieved as a result of the\nmergers, any changes to GreenSky\u0092s strategy or\noperations that may be implemented after the\nconsummation of the mergers or any costs\nincurred in connection\nwith the mergers. Neither the GreenSky board\nnor the GreenSky special committee quantified\nsynergies that may be achieved as a result of\nthe mergers. Furthermore, the GreenSky\nforecasts did not take into account the effect\nof any failure of the\nmergers to be consummated and should not be\nviewed as relevant or continuing in that\ncontext.\n\nThe GreenSky forecasts include non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation\nfrom, or as a substitute for, financial\ninformation presented in\ncompliance with GAAP, and may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled measures used\nby other companies. Financial measures\nincluded in projections provided to a\nfinancial advisor and a board of directors in\nconnection with a business combination\ntransaction are excluded from the definition\nof \u0093non-GAAP financial measures\u0094 under the\nrules of the SEC, and therefore such financial\nmeasures are not subject to SEC rules\nregarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, which may otherwise require a\nreconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure\nto a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations\nof non-GAAP financial measures were not\nprovided to and were not relied on by J.P.\nMorgan or Piper Sandler for purposes of their\nrespective financial analyses and opinions or\nby the GreenSky board or the GreenSky\nspecial committee in connection with their\nrespective consideration of the mergers, nor\nwere they provided to GS Group. Accordingly,\nGreenSky has not provided a reconciliation of\nthese non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.\n\nGreenSky does not intend to update or\notherwise revise the GreenSky forecasts after\nthe date of this proxy statement/prospectus\nto reflect circumstances existing since their\npreparation or to reflect the occurrence of\nunanticipated events, even in the event that\nany or all of the underlying assumptions are\nshown to be in error, or to reflect changes in\ngeneral economic or\nindustry conditions.\n\n-74-\n\nBy including the GreenSky forecasts in this\nproxy statement/prospectus, neither GreenSky\nnor GS Group nor any of their respective\ndirectors, officers, employees, advisors or\nother representatives has made or makes any\nrepresentation to any person regarding the\nultimate performance of GreenSky compared to\nthe information contained in the GreenSky\nforecasts. Accordingly, the GreenSky forecasts\nshould not be construed as financial guidance,\nnor relied on as such. The GreenSky forecasts\nare not included in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus in order to induce any\nGreenSky stockholder to vote in favor of the\nproposals contained in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus or to influence any\nGreenSky stockholder or any other person to\nmake any investment decision with respect to\nthe transaction or otherwise, but rather\nsolely because the GreenSky forecasts or\nportions thereof were made available to the\nGreenSky board, the GreenSky special\ncommittee, their respective financial advisors\nand certain third parties potentially\ninterested in a transaction with GreenSky,\nincluding GS Group and Financial Sponsor D, to\nthe extent described above.

Morgan deemed       \n      appropriate for the purposes of its     \n      opinion.                                \n                                              \nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with\ncertain members of the management of GreenSky,\nGS Group and GS Bank with respect to certain\naspects of the mergers, and the past and\ncurrent business operations of GreenSky, GS\nGroup and GS Bank, the financial condition and\nfuture prospects and operations of GreenSky,\nGS Group and GS Bank, and certain other\nmatters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or\nappropriate to its inquiry. In giving its\nopinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed\nthe accuracy and completeness of all\ninformation that was publicly available or was\nfurnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by\nGreenSky or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P.\nMorgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently\nverify any such information or its accuracy or\ncompleteness and, pursuant to its engagement\nletter with GreenSky, did not assume any\nobligation to undertake any such independent\nverification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and\nwas not provided with any valuation or\nappraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor\ndid J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of\nGreenSky or any of GS Group or GS Bank under\nany state or federal laws relating to\nbankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In\nrelying on financial analyses and forecasts\nprovided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom,\nJ.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably\nprepared based on assumptions reflecting the\nbest currently available estimates and\njudgments by management as to the expected\nfuture results of operations and financial\ncondition of GreenSky to which such analyses\nor forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no\nview as to such analyses or forecasts or the\nassumptions on which they were based. J.P.\nMorgan also assumed that the company merger\nwill qualify as a tax-freereorganization for\nUnited States federal income tax purposes, and\nwill be consummated as described in the merger\nagreement, and that the definitive merger\nagreement would not differ in any material\nrespect from the draft thereof provided to\nJ.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the\nrepresentations and warranties made by\nGreenSky, GreenSky Holdings and GS Group in\nthe merger agreement and the related\nagreements were and will be true and correct\nin all respects material to its analysis. J.P.\nMorgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax\nexpert and relied on the assessments made by\nadvisors to GreenSky with respect to such\nissues. J.P. Morgan further assumed -77-\n\nthat all material governmental, regulatory or\nother consents and approvals necessary for the\nconsummation of the mergers will be obtained\nwithout any adverse effect on GreenSky or on\nthe\ncontemplated benefits of the mergers.\n\nThe GreenSky forecasts furnished to J.P.\nMorgan were prepared by GreenSky\u0092s management.\nGreenSky does not publicly disclose internal\nmanagement projections of the type provided to\nJ.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan\u0092s\nanalysis of the proposed mergers, and such\nprojections were not prepared with a view\ntoward public\ndisclosure. These projections were based on\nnumerous variables and assumptions that are\ninherently uncertain and may be beyond the\ncontrol of GreenSky\u0092s management, including,\nwithout limitation, factors related to general\neconomic and\ncompetitive conditions and prevailing interest\nrates. Accordingly, actual results could vary\nsignificantly from those set forth in such\nprojections. For more information regarding\nthe use of projections and other forward-\nlooking statements, please\nrefer to the section entitled \u0093\u0097Certain\nUnaudited Financial Information\u0094 beginning on\npage 73 of this proxy statement/prospectus.\n\nJ.P. Morgan\u0092s opinion was necessarily based on\neconomic, market and other conditions as in\neffect on, and the information made available\nto J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such\nopinion. J.P. Morgan\u0092s opinion noted that\nsubsequent developments may affect J.P.\nMorgan\u0092s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does\nnot have any obligation to update, revise, or\nreaffirm such opinion. J.P.\nMorgan\u0092s opinion is limited to the fairness,\nfrom a financial point of view, to the holders\nof GreenSky Class A common stock of the\nexchange ratio in the proposed company merger,\nand J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to\nthe fairness\nof any consideration to be paid in connection\nwith the mergers or the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement to the\nholders of any other class of securities,\ncreditors or other constituencies of GreenSky\nor GreenSky Holdings\n(including the holders of Common Units) or as\nto the underlying decision by GreenSky to\nengage in the mergers. J.P. Morgan also did\nnot express an opinion as to the allocation of\nthe aggregate consideration among the various\nclasses of shares of\ncapital stock or other equity interests of\nGreenSky and GreenSky Holdings or as to the\nterms of the tax receivable agreement\namendment, the holdback agreement, the voting\nagreement or any other document or arrangement\nbeing entered into in\nconnection with the mergers and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement or any governance or other rights\ncontained in any of them (and J.P. Morgan has\nnot taken any such terms or rights into\naccount in its analysis), and its\nopinion did not take into account the\nindividual circumstances of any holders with\nrespect to control, governance or other rights\nwhich may distinguish such holders from other\nholders. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no\nopinion with respect to\nthe amount or nature of any compensation to\nany officers, directors, or employees of any\nparty to the mergers, or any class of such\npersons relative to the exchange ratio\napplicable to the holders of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock in the company\nmerger or with respect to the fairness of any\nsuch compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no\nopinion as to the price at which GreenSky\nClass A common stock or GS Group common stock\nwould trade at any future time.\n\nThe terms of the merger agreement, including\nthe exchange ratio, were determined through\narm\u0092s-length negotiations between GreenSky and\nGS Group, and the decision to enter into the\nmerger agreement was solely that of the\nGreenSky board and the GS Group board. J.P.\nMorgan\u0092s opinion and\nfinancial analyses were only one of the many\nfactors considered by the GreenSky board in\nits evaluation of the proposed mergers and\nshould not be viewed as determinative of the\nviews of the GreenSky board or management with\nrespect to the proposed\ncompany merger or the exchange ratio.\n\nIn accordance with customary investment\nbanking practice, J.P. Morgan employed\ngenerally accepted\nvaluation methodology in rendering its opinion\nto the GreenSky board on September 14, 2021\nand contained in the presentation delivered to\nthe GreenSky board on such date in connection\nwith the rendering of such opinion. The\nsummary below does\nnot purport to be a complete description of\nthe analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan.\nSome of the summaries of the financial\nanalyses include information presented in\ntabular format. The tables are not intended to\nstand alone, and in order to more fully\nunderstand the financial analyses used by J.P.\nMorgan, the tables must be read together with\nthe full text of each summary. Considering the\ndata set forth below without considering the\nfull narrative description of the financial\nanalyses, including the methodologies and\nassumptions underlying the analyses, could\ncreate a misleading or incomplete view of J.P.\nMorgan\u0092s analyses.\n\n-78-\n\nPublic Trading Multiples Analysis Using\npublicly available information, J.P. Morgan\ncompared selected financial data of GreenSky\nwith similar data for certain selected\npublicly traded companies (the \u0093selected\ncompanies\u0094). The selected companies were:\n                                 \n      American Express Company;  \n                                 \n                            \n      Synchrony Financial;  \n                            \n                                    \n      Discover Financial Services;  \n                                    \n                                          \n      Capital One Financial Corporation;  \n                                          \n                                              \n      Alliance Data Systems Corporation; and  \n                                              \n                                \n      LendingClub Corporation.  \n                                \nThese companies were selected by J.P. Morgan\nbecause of similarities to GreenSky in one or\nmore of their business characteristics and, in\ncertain cases, similarities to GreenSky based\non certain operational characteristics and/or\ncertain financial metrics. However, none of\nthe selected companies is identical or\ndirectly comparable to GreenSky, and certain\nof the selected companies may have\ncharacteristics that are materially different\nfrom those of GreenSky. Accordingly, a\ncomplete analysis of the results of the\nfollowing calculations cannot be limited to a\nquantitative review of such results and\ninvolves complex considerations and judgments\nconcerning the differences in the financial\nand operating characteristics of the selected\ncompanies compared to GreenSky and other\nfactors that could affect the public trading\nvalue of the selected companies and GreenSky.\nIn all instances, multiples were based on\nclosing stock prices on September 13, 2021,\nwhich was the last practicable day prior to\nthe delivery of the J.P. Morgan opinion. For\neach of the following analyses performed by\nJ.P. Morgan, financial data for the selected\ncompanies were based on the selected\ncompanies\u0092 public filings and information J.P.\nMorgan obtained from FactSet Research Systems.\nWith respect to the selected companies,\npublicly available financial information as of\nJune 30, 2021 was used. The multiples for each\nof the selected companies were based on such\ninformation. With respect to GreenSky and the\nselected companies, the information J.P.\nMorgan presented included a multiple of price\nto estimated earnings per share for the fiscal\nyear 2022 (referred to in this section as\n\u00932022E P/E\u0094), based on reported metrics and\navailable estimates obtained from public\nfilings, FactSet Research Systems and the\nGreenSky forecasts. Based on the results of\nthis analysis and other factors which J.P.\nMorgan considered appropriate based on its\nexperience and judgment, J.P. Morgan selected\na multiple reference range for GreenSky of\n9.0x to 13.0x for 2022E P/E and then applied\nthe multiple reference range to GreenSky\u0092s\nestimated earnings per share for the fiscal\nyear 2022 (as provided in the GreenSky\nforecasts). After applying this range to\nGreenSky\u0092s estimated 2022 earnings per share,\nJ.P. Morgan\u0092s analysis indicated an implied\nequity value per share range of $6.50 to $9.25\n(rounded to the nearest $0.25 per share) per\nshare of GreenSky Class A common stock, as\ncompared to the implied value of the merger\nconsideration of $12.28 per share of GreenSky\nClass A common stock, which was calculated\nbased on the product of the exchange ratio of\n0.03 and the closing price of GS Group common\nstock on September 13, 2021 of $409.26.\nSelected Transaction Analysis Using publicly\navailable information, J.P. Morgan examined\neach of the below selected transactions with\nrespect to the equity value implied for each\ntarget company as a multiple of such target\ncompany\u0092s estimated pre-taxincome for 2021.\nThe below transactions were selected, among\nother reasons, because the transactions -79-\n\noccurred within a period that J.P. Morgan\ndeemed relevant and the businesses involved in\nthese transactions operated in similar\nindustries and/or had similar financial\nprofiles. The transactions considered are as\nfollows:\n                                              \n                                     Equity\u00a0  \n  Announ\u2026                            Value\u00a0/  \n  Date       Target      Acquirer    2021E\u00a0   \n                                     Pre-tax  \n                                     Income   \n             Service\u00a0    Truist\u00a0              \n  August     Finance\u00a0    Financi\u2026    19.2x    \n  2021       Company,    Corpora\u2026             \n             LLC                              \n  June       EnerBank    Regions     11.8x    \n  2021       USA         Bank                 \n                                              \nBased on the results of these selected\ntransaction analyses and other factors that\nJ.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on\nits experience and judgment, J.P. Morgan\napplied a multiple range of 11.8x \u0096 19.2x to\nGreenSky\u0092s estimated pre-taxincome for the\nfiscal year 2021 (as provided in the GreenSky\nforecasts). J.P. Morgan\u0092s analysis indicated\nan implied equity value per share range of\n$7.50 to $12.25 (rounded to the nearest $0.25\nper share) per share of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock, as compared to the implied value\nof the merger consideration of $12.28 per\nshare of GreenSky Class A common stock, which\nwas calculated based on the product of the\nexchange ratio of 0.03 and the closing price\nof GS Group common stock on September 13, 2021\nof $409.26. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis J.P.\nMorgan conducted a discounted cash flow\nanalysis for the purpose of determining an\nimplied fully diluted equity value per share\nof GreenSky Class A common stock. J.P. Morgan\ncalculated the present value of unlevered free\ncash flows that GreenSky is expected to\ngenerate beginning with GreenSky\u0092s fiscal year\nended 2022 through the end of fiscal year 2025\n(as provided in the GreenSky forecasts). J.P.\nMorgan also calculated a range of terminal\nvalues for GreenSky at the end of the four-\nyear period ending 2025 by applying terminal\ngrowth rates provided by GreenSky management\nranging from 1.5% to 2.5% for unlevered free\ncash flow of GreenSky during the terminal year\nof the GreenSky forecasts. The unlevered free\ncash flows and the range of terminal values\nwere then discounted to present values as of\nDecember 31, 2021 using a discount rate range\nof 11.0% to 13.0%, which was chosen by J.P.\nMorgan based on an analysis of the weighted\naverage cost of capital of GreenSky. The\npresent values of the unlevered free cash\nflows and terminal asset values were then\nadjusted to include the present value, as of\nDecember 31, 2021, of the net tax benefit\nretained by GreenSky on a stand-alone basis of\n$47 million, as calculated by GreenSky\nmanagement and provided to J.P. Morgan, after\ngiving effect to the payment required under\nGreenSky\u0092s tax receivable agreement and\nassuming an illustrative 8.0% discount rate.\nBased on the results of this analysis, J.P.\nMorgan arrived at a range of implied equity\nvalues per share of GreenSky Class A common\nstock of $6.00 to $8.25 (rounded to the\nnearest $0.25), as compared to the implied\nvalue of the merger consideration of $12.28\nper share of GreenSky Class A common stock,\nwhich was calculated based on the product of\nthe exchange ratio of 0.03 and the closing\nprice of GS Group common stock on September\n13, 2021 of $409.26. Certain Other Information\nJ.P. Morgan also reviewed and presented other\ninformation, solely for informational\npurposes, including:\n                                              \n      the historical range of trading prices  \n      of GreenSky Class\u00a0A common stock for    \n      the 52-week period ending September\u00a0    \n      13, 2021, which indicated low to high   \n      closing trading prices during such      \n      period ranging from $3.46 to $8.85 per  \n      share; and                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      analyst share price targets for         \n      GreenSky Class\u00a0A common stock in        \n      recently published, publicly available  \n      research analysts\u0092 reports, with share   \n      price targets ranging from $5.00 to     \n      $13.00 (rounded to the nearest $0.25).  \n                                              \nMiscellaneous The foregoing summary of certain\nmaterial financial analyses does not purport\nto be a complete description of the analyses\nor data presented by J.P. Morgan. The\npreparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nprocess and -80-\n\nis not necessarily susceptible to partial\nanalysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan\nbelieves that the foregoing summary and its\nanalyses must be considered as a whole and\nthat selecting\nportions of the foregoing summary and these\nanalyses, without considering all of its\nanalyses as a whole, could create an\nincomplete view of the processes underlying\nthe analyses and its opinion. As a result, the\nranges of valuations resulting from\nany particular analysis or combination of\nanalyses described above were merely utilized\nto create points of reference for analytical\npurposes and should not be taken to be the\nview of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual\nvalue of GreenSky or GS\nGroup. The order of analyses described does\nnot represent the relative importance or\nweight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan.\nIn arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did\nnot attribute any particular weight to any\nanalyses or factors considered\nby it and did not form an opinion as to\nwhether any individual analysis or factor\n(positive or negative), considered in\nisolation, supported or failed to support its\nopinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the\ntotality of the factors and analyses\nperformed in determining its opinion.\n\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future\nresults are inherently uncertain, as they are\nsubject to\nnumerous factors or events beyond the control\nof the parties and their advisors.\nAccordingly, forecasts and analyses used or\nmade by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily\nindicative of actual future results, which may\nbe significantly more or less\nfavorable than suggested by those analyses.\nMoreover, J.P. Morgan\u0092s analyses are not and\ndo not purport to be appraisals or otherwise\nreflective of the prices at which businesses\nactually could be acquired or sold. None of\nthe selected\ncompanies reviewed as described in the above\nsummary is identical to GreenSky. However, the\nselected companies were chosen because they\nare publicly traded companies with operations\nand businesses that, for purposes of J.P.\nMorgan\u0092s analysis,\nmay be considered similar to those of\nGreenSky. The analyses necessarily involve\ncomplex considerations and judgments\nconcerning differences in financial and\noperational characteristics of the companies\ninvolved and other factors that could affect\nthe companies compared to GreenSky.\n\nAs a part of its investment banking business,\nJ.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually\nengaged\nin the valuation of businesses and their\nsecurities in connection with mergers and\nacquisitions, investments for passive and\ncontrol purposes, negotiated underwritings,\nsecondary distributions of listed and unlisted\nsecurities, private placements,\nand valuations for corporate and other\npurposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise\nGreenSky with respect to the mergers and the\nother transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement on the basis of, among other things,\nsuch experience and its\nqualifications and reputation in connection\nwith such matters and its familiarity with\nGreenSky and the industries in which it\noperates.\n\nJ.P. Morgan will receive a fee from GreenSky\nof $3 million for the delivery of its opinion.\nIn addition, GreenSky has agreed to pay J.P.\nMorgan a transaction fee of approximately $31\nmillion, subject to closing adjustments,\nagainst which the opinion fee will be\ncredited, upon the consummation of the\nproposed mergers. In addition, GreenSky has\nagreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for\nits expenses incurred in connection with its\nservices, including the fees and disbursements\nof counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan\nagainst certain liabilities arising out of\nJ.P. Morgan\u0092s engagement.\n\nDuring the two years preceding the date of\nJ.P. Morgan\u0092s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its\naffiliates had commercial or investment\nbanking\nrelationships with the GreenSky, for which\nJ.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received\ncustomary compensation, and neither J.P.\nMorgan nor its affiliates have had any\nmaterial commercial or investment banking\nrelationships with GS Group. Such\nservices for GreenSky during such period\nincluded acting as sole lead arranger and sole\nlead bookrunner for GreenSky\u0092s revolving\ncredit facility and term loan B closed in\nAugust 2017 that was amended and closed in\nJune 2020. In addition, J.P.\nMorgan\u0092s commercial banking affiliate is an\nagent bank and a lender under outstanding\ncredit facilities of GreenSky, including\nacting as (i) sole administrative agent for\nGreenSky on an ABS warehouse facility that\nclosed in May 2020 and\nwas subsequently amended from time to time,\nand (ii) administrative agent for GreenSky on\na revolving credit facility and term loan that\nclosed in August 2017 and was subsequently\namended from time to time, for which J.P.\nMorgan received\ncustomary compensation or other financial\nbenefits. J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold,\non a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the\noutstanding shares of each of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock and GS Group common stock. During\nthe two-year period preceding delivery of its\nopinion, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P.\nMorgan from GreenSky were approximately $1.5\nmillion and from GS Group were\n\n-81-\n\napproximately $60 million. In the ordinary\ncourse of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and\nits affiliates may actively trade the debt and\nequity securities or financial instruments\n(including derivatives, bank loans or other\nobligations) of GreenSky or GS Group for their\nown accounts or for the accounts of customers\nand, accordingly, they may at any time hold\nlong or short positions in such securities or\nother financial instruments. Opinion of Piper\nSandler, GreenSky Special Committee\u0092s\nFinancial Advisor The GreenSky special\ncommittee retained Piper Sandler to act as its\nfinancial advisor in connection with the\nmergers. The GreenSky special committee\nselected Piper Sandler to act as its financial\nadvisor on the basis of, among other things,\nPiper Sandler being a nationally recognized\ninvestment banking firm whose principal\nbusiness specialty is financial institutions,\nconsumer lending and specialty finance\ncompanies, its past advisory services to\nGreenSky and its familiarity with GreenSky\u0092s\nbusiness. In the ordinary course of its\ninvestment banking business, Piper Sandler is\nregularly engaged in the valuation of\nfinancial institutions, consumer lending and\nspecialty finance companies and their\nsecurities in connection with mergers and\nacquisitions and other corporate transactions.\nAt the September 14, 2021 meeting at which the\nGreenSky special committee considered the\nmergers and the merger agreement, Piper\nSandler delivered to the GreenSky special\ncommittee its oral opinion, which was\nsubsequently confirmed in writing on September\n14, 2021, to the effect that, as of such date,\nthe merger consideration was fair to the\nholders of GreenSky\u0092s Class A common stock\nfrom a financial point of view. The full text\nof Piper Sandler\u0092s opinion is attached as\nAnnex C to this proxy statement/prospectus.\nThe opinion outlines the procedures followed,\nassumptions made, matters considered and\nqualifications and limitations on the review\nundertaken by Piper Sandler in rendering its\nopinion. The description of the opinion set\nforth below is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the full text of the opinion.\nGreenSky stockholders are urged to read the\nentire opinion carefully in connection with\ntheir consideration of the proposed mergers.\nPiper Sandler\u0092s opinion was directed to the\nGreenSky special committee in connection with\nits consideration of the mergers and the\nmerger agreement and does not constitute a\nrecommendation to any GreenSky stockholder as\nto how any such GreenSky stockholder should\nvote at the special meeting. Piper Sandler\u0092s\nopinion was directed only to the fairness,\nfrom a financial point of view, of the merger\nconsideration to the holders of GreenSky Class\nA common stock and did not address the\nunderlying business decision of GreenSky to\nengage in the mergers, the form or structure\nof the mergers or any other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, the\nrelative merits of the mergers as compared to\nany other alternative transactions or business\nstrategies that might exist for GreenSky or\nthe effect of any other transaction in which\nGreenSky might engage. Piper Sandler also did\nnot express any opinion as to the fairness of\nthe amount or nature of the compensation to be\nreceived in the mergers by any officer,\ndirector or employee of GreenSky or GS Group,\nor any class of such persons, if any, relative\nto the compensation to be received in the\nmergers by any other GreenSky stockholder.\nPiper Sandler\u0092s opinion was approved by Piper\nSandler\u0092s fairness opinion committee.

In performing its review, Piper Sandler\nrelied upon the accuracy and completeness of\nall of the financial and other information\nthat was available to and reviewed by Piper\nSandler from public sources, that was provided\nto or discussed with Piper Sandler by\nGreenSky, GS Group or their respective\nrepresentatives, or that was otherwise\nreviewed by Piper Sandler, and Piper Sandler\nassumed such accuracy and completeness for\npurposes of rendering its opinion without any\nindependent verification or investigation.\nPiper Sandler was not asked to and did not\nundertake an independent verification of any\nsuch information and Piper Sandler did not\nassume any responsibility or liability for the\naccuracy or completeness thereof. Piper\nSandler relied on the assurances of the senior\nmanagement of GreenSky that they were not\naware of any facts or circumstances that would\nhave made any of such information inaccurate\nor misleading in any respect material to Piper\nSandler\u0092s analyses. Piper Sandler did not make\nan independent evaluation or perform an\nappraisal of the specific assets, the\ncollateral securing assets or the liabilities\n(contingent or otherwise) of GreenSky or GS\nGroup, nor was Piper Sandler furnished with\nany such evaluations or appraisals. Piper\nSandler rendered no opinion on, or evaluation\nof, the collectability of any assets or the\nfuture performance of any loans of GreenSky or\nGS Group. Piper Sandler did not make an\nindependent evaluation of the adequacy of the\nallowance for loan losses of GreenSky or GS\nGroup, or of the combined entity after the\nmergers, and Piper Sandler did not review any\nindividual credit files relating to GreenSky\nor GS Group. Piper Sandler assumed, with\nGreenSky\u0092s consent, that the respective\nallowances for loan losses for both GreenSky\nand GS Group were adequate to cover such\nlosses and would be adequate on a pro forma\nbasis for the combined entity. In preparing\nits analyses, Piper Sandler used the GreenSky\nforecasts. In addition, Piper Sandler used\npublicly available mean research analyst net\nincome, EPS and dividends per share estimates\nfor GS Group for the years ending December 31,\n2021 through December 31, 2023. With respect\nto the GreenSky forecasts, the senior\nmanagement of GreenSky confirmed to Piper\nSandler that such information reflected the\nbest currently available estimates and\njudgments of that senior management as to the\nfuture financial performance of GreenSky. With\nrespect to the publicly available research\nanalyst estimates referred to above, Piper\nSandler assumed, with the consent of the\nGreenSky special committee, that such analyst\nestimates were reasonable for purposes of\nPiper Sandler\u0092s analyses. Piper Sandler\nexpressed no opinion as to such information,\nor the assumptions on which such information\nwas based. Piper Sandler also assumed that\nthere had been no material change in the\nrespective assets, financial condition,\nresults of operations, business or prospects\nof GreenSky or GS Group since the date of the\nmost recent financial statements made\navailable to Piper Sandler. Piper Sandler\nassumed in all respects material to its\nanalyses that GreenSky and GS Group would\nremain as going concerns for all periods\nrelevant to its analyses. -83-\n\nPiper Sandler also assumed, with GreenSky\u0092s\nconsent, that (i) each of the parties\nto the merger agreement would comply in all\nmaterial respects with all material terms and\nconditions of the merger agreement and all\nrelated agreements required to effect the\nmergers, that all of the representations and\nwarranties contained in such\nagreements were true and correct in all\nmaterial respects, that each of the parties to\nsuch agreements would perform in all material\nrespects all of the covenants and other\nobligations required to be performed by such\nparty under such agreements and\nthat the conditions precedent in such\nagreements were not and would not be waived,\n(ii) in the course of obtaining the necessary\nregulatory or third-party approvals, consents\nand releases with respect to the mergers, no\ndelay, limitation,\nrestriction or condition would be imposed that\nwould have an adverse effect on GreenSky, GS\nGroup, the mergers or any related transactions\nand (iii) the mergers and any related\ntransactions would be consummated in\naccordance with the terms of\nthe merger agreement without any waiver,\nmodification or amendment of any material\nterm, condition or agreement thereof and in\ncompliance with all applicable laws and other\nrequirements. Piper Sandler expressed no\nopinion as to any legal, accounting\nor tax matters relating to the mergers and the\nother transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement.\n\nPiper Sandler\u0092s opinion was\nnecessarily based on financial, economic,\nregulatory, market and other conditions as in\neffect on, and the information made available\nto Piper Sandler as of, the date thereof.\nEvents occurring after the date thereof could\nmaterially affect Piper\nSandler\u0092s opinion. Piper Sandler has not\nundertaken to update, revise, reaffirm or\nwithdraw its opinion or otherwise comment upon\nevents occurring after the date thereof. Piper\nSandler expressed no opinion as to the trading\nvalue of GreenSky\nClass A common stock or GS Group common stock\nat any time or what the value of GS Group\ncommon stock would be once it is actually\nreceived by the holders of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock.\n\nIn rendering its opinion, Piper Sandler\nperformed a variety of financial analyses. The\nsummary below is not a complete description of\nall the\nanalyses underlying Piper Sandler\u0092s opinion or\nthe presentation made by Piper Sandler to the\nGreenSky special committee, but is a summary\nof the material analyses performed and\npresented by Piper Sandler. The summary\nincludes information\npresented in tabular format. In order to fully\nunderstand the financial analyses, these\ntables must be read together with the\naccompanying text. The tables alone do not\nconstitute a complete description of the\nfinancial analyses.The\npreparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nprocess involving subjective judgments as to\nthe most appropriate and relevant methods of\nfinancial analysis and the application of\nthose methods to the particular circumstances.\nThe process, therefore,\nis not necessarily susceptible to a partial\nanalysis or summary description. Piper Sandler\nbelieves that its analyses must be considered\nas a whole and that selecting portions of the\nfactors and analyses to be considered without\nconsidering all\nfactors and analyses, or attempting to ascribe\nrelative weights to some or all such factors\nand analyses, could create an incomplete view\nof the evaluation process underlying its\nopinion. Also, no company included in Piper\nSandler\u0092s comparative\nanalyses described below is identical to\nGreenSky or GS Group and no transactions are\nidentical to the mergers. Accordingly, an\nanalysis of comparable companies or\ntransactions involves complex considerations\nand judgments concerning differences in\nfinancial and operating characteristics of the\ncompanies and other factors that could affect\nthe public trading values or transaction\nvalues, as the case may be, of GreenSky and GS\nGroup and the companies to which they were\ncompared. In arriving at\nits opinion, Piper Sandler did not attribute\nany particular weight to any analysis or\nfactor that it considered. Rather, Piper\nSandler made qualitative judgments as to the\nsignificance and relevance of each analysis\nand factor. Piper Sandler did not\nform an opinion as to whether any individual\nanalysis or factor (positive or negative)\nconsidered in isolation supported or failed to\nsupport its opinion; rather, Piper Sandler\nmade its determination as to the fairness of\nthe merger consideration to\nthe holders of GreenSky Class A common stock\non the basis of its experience and\nprofessional judgment after considering the\nresults of all its analyses taken as a whole.\n\nIn performing its analyses, Piper Sandler also\nmade numerous assumptions with respect to\nindustry performance, business and economic\nconditions and various other matters, many of\nwhich cannot be predicted and are beyond the\ncontrol of GreenSky, GS Group and Piper\nSandler. The analyses performed by Piper\nSandler are not necessarily indicative of\nactual values or future results,\nboth of which may be significantly more or\nless favorable than suggested by such\nanalyses. Piper Sandler prepared its analyses\nsolely for purposes of rendering its opinion\nand provided such analyses to the GreenSky\nspecial committee at its\nSeptember 14, 2021 meeting.\n\n-84-\n\nEstimates of the values of companies do not\npurport to be appraisals or necessarily\nreflect the prices at which companies or their\nsecurities may actually be sold. Such\nestimates are inherently subject to\nuncertainty and actual values may be\nmaterially different. Accordingly, Piper\nSandler\u0092s analyses do not necessarily reflect\nthe value of GreenSky Class A common stock or\nGS Group common stock or the prices at which\nGreenSky Class A common stock or GS Group\ncommon stock may be sold at any time. The\nanalyses of Piper Sandler and its opinion were\namong a number of factors taken into\nconsideration by the GreenSky special\ncommittee in making its determination to\nrecommend that the GreenSky board approve and\nadopt the merger agreement and related\nagreements and the analyses described below\nshould not be viewed as determinative of the\ndecision of the GreenSky special committee\nwith respect to the fairness of the merger\nconsideration. Summary of Proposed Merger\nConsideration and Implied Transaction Metrics\nPiper Sandler reviewed the financial terms of\nthe proposed mergers. Pursuant to the terms of\nthe merger agreement, at the company merger\neffective time each share of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time,\nexcept for certain shares as set forth in the\nmerger agreement, will be converted into the\nright to receive 0.03 shares of GS Group\ncommon stock. Piper Sandler calculated (i) an\naggregate implied transaction equity value of\napproximately $2.3 billion, (ii) an implied\ntransaction equity value price per share of\n$12.28 consisting of the implied value of\n184,178,701 shares of GreenSky common stock\nand 3,177,486 shares of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock underlying options with a\nweighted average exercise price per share of\n$9.82, in each case, outstanding as of July\n29, 2021, as provided by senior management of\nGreenSky, and based on the closing price per\nshare of GS Group common stock on September\n13, 2021, the last trading day prior to the\nexecution of the merger agreement and (iii) an\naggregate implied transaction enterprise value\nof $2.5 billion, calculated based on net debt\nof approximately $248 million as of June 30,\n2021, as provided by senior management of\nGreenSky. Based upon financial information for\nGreenSky as of or for the last twelve months\n(\u0093LTM\u0094) ended June 30, 2021, the GreenSky\nforecasts, and the closing price of GreenSky\u0092s\nClass A common stock on September 13, 2021,\nPiper Sandler calculated the following implied\ntransaction multiples:\n                                              \n  Transaction Enterprise Value /

To\napproximate the terminal value of a share of\nGreenSky Class A common stock at December 31,\n2025, Piper Sandler applied total equity value\nto net income multiples ranging from 8.0x to\n13.0x and total enterprise value to adjusted\nEBITDA multiples ranging from 6.0x to 11.0x.\nPiper Sandler selected these price to earnings\nand tangible book value multiples based on\nPiper Sandler\u0092s review of, among other\nmatters, the trading multiples of selected\ncompanies that Piper Sandler deemed to be\ncomparable to GreenSky. The terminal values\nwere then discounted to present values using\ndifferent discount rates ranging from 10.0% to\n14.0%, which were chosen to reflect different\nassumptions regarding required rates of return\nof holders or prospective buyers of GreenSky\nClass A common stock and which took into\naccount a capital asset pricing model-based\ncalculated weighted average cost of capital\nestimate for GreenSky of 12.37%, and the\nresult was divided by the number of fully\ndiluted outstanding shares of GreenSky common\nstock as of July 29, 2021, as provided by\nsenior management of GreenSky. As illustrated\nin the following tables, the analysis\nindicated an imputed range of values per share\nof GreenSky Class A common stock of $3.93 to\n$7.51 when applying multiples of total equity\nvalue to net income and of $5.09 to $10.24\nwhen applying multiples of total enterprise\nvalue to adjusted EBITDA.

As illustrated in the following\ntables, the analysis indicated an imputed\nrange of values per share of GS Group common\nstock of $309.76 to $420.95 when applying\nmultiples of earnings. -91-\n\nTotal Equity Value / Net Income Multiples\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nPiper Sandler also considered and discussed\nwith the GreenSky special committee how this\nanalysis would be affected by changes in the\nunderlying assumptions, including variations\nwith respect to net income. To illustrate this\nimpact, Piper Sandler performed a similar\nanalysis assuming GS Group\u0092s net income varied\nfrom 20.0% above consensus GS Group estimates\nto 20.0% below consensus GS Group estimates.\nThis analysis resulted in the following range\nof per share values for GS Group common stock,\napplying the total equity value to net income\nmultiples range of 10.5x to 13.5x and a\ndiscount rate of 10.48%, in each case,\nreferred to above and dividing the result by\nthe number of outstanding shares of GS Group\ncommon stock as of June 30, 2021, as reported\nin GS Group\u0092s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Qfor\nthe quarterly period ended June 30, 2021.\nTotal Equity Value / Net Income Multiples\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nPiper Sandler noted that the net present value\nanalysis is a widely used valuation\nmethodology, but the results of such\nmethodology are highly dependent upon the\nnumerous assumptions that must be made, and\nthe results thereof are not necessarily\nindicative of actual values or future results.\nPiper Sandler\u0092s Relationships Piper Sandler is\nacting as financial advisor to the GreenSky\nspecial committee in connection with the\nmergers and will receive a fee for such\nservices in an amount equal to $3.5 million,\n$1.75 million of which became payable upon the\nrendering of Piper Sandler\u0092s opinion on\nSeptember 14, 2021 and $1.75 million of which\nis contingent upon the consummation of the\nmergers. Piper Sandler also received a\n$300,000 retainer fee, which retainer fee will\nbe credited in full towards the fee which will\nbecome payable to Piper Sandler upon\nconsummation of the mergers. The GreenSky\nspecial committee has also agreed to cause\nGreenSky to indemnify Piper Sandler against\ncertain claims and liabilities arising out of\nPiper Sandler\u0092s engagement and to reimburse\nPiper Sandler for certain of its out-of-\npocketexpenses incurred in connection with\nPiper Sandler\u0092s engagement.

The aggregate, estimated\nvalue of the payments and benefits that the\nother covered employees may receive on a\nqualifying termination (inclusive of Mr.\nPartlow\u0092s entitlement to Continued Coverage),\nbased on the assumptions\nused for valuing such payments and benefits to\nthe named executive officers, including the\nassumption that a covered termination occurs\nimmediately following the effective time, but\nexcluding the value of accelerated vesting of\nequity, is\n$4,409,228.\n\nTreatment of Annual Bonuses\n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement,\nGreenSky employees, including the GreenSky\nnamed executive officers and the other covered\nemployees,\nwill receive, immediately prior to the\neffective time (a) to the extent unpaid, an\nannual bonus for calendar year 2021, based on\nactual performance, and (b) if the effective\ntime occurs in calendar year 2022, a prorated\ntarget annual bonus\nfor calendar year 2022.\n\nThe potential value of the annual bonus\npayments that GreenSky\u0092s named executive\nofficers may receive at the\neffective time is shown in the section below\nentitled \u0093\u0097Quantification of Potential\nPayments and Benefits to GreenSky Named\nExecutive Officers\u0094 beginning on page 98 of\nthis proxy statement/prospectus.\nThe aggregate, estimated value of the annual\nbonus payments that the other covered\nemployees may receive at the effective time,\nbased on the assumptions used for valuing such\npayments to the named executive officers, is\n$1,520,000.\n\nRetention Bonuses\n\nUnder the\nmerger agreement, GS Group has agreed that\nGreenSky may establish a cash retention bonus\nprogram (the \u0093retention bonuses\u0094) for the\nbenefit of certain GreenSky employees.\nGreenSky and GS Group have agreed that any\nretention bonuses granted\nmust provide that the recipient will be\nsubject to a \u0093best-net cutback\u0094 provision for\npurposes of Section 280G of the Code, under\nwhich, if the recipient is eligible to receive\npayments and\nbenefits subject to Section 280G of the Code,\nsuch payments and benefits will either be\nprovided in full or reduced to the greatest\namount that does not trigger Section 280G of\nthe Code, whichever results in the greatest\nafter-tax amount. GreenSky\u0092s named executive\nofficers and the other covered employees are\neligible to receive retention bonuses,\nalthough no retention bonuses have been\nfinalized as of the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nIndemnification; Directors\u0092 and Officers\u0092\nInsurance\n\nGreenSky is organized under the laws of the\nstate of Delaware. Section 145 of the DGCL\npermits a corporation to include in its\norganizational documents, and in agreements\nbetween the corporation and its directors and\nofficers, provisions expanding the scope of\nindemnification beyond that specifically\nprovided by current law. The GreenSky charter\nprovides that GreenSky is\nauthorized to indemnify, and to advance\nexpenses to, each current, former or\nprospective director, officer, employee or\nagent of GreenSky to the fullest extent\npermitted by Section 145 of the DGCL. The\nGreenSky bylaws provide indemnification to\nthe fullest extent permitted by the applicable\nlaw (including as it presently exists or may\nthereafter be amended) to any person who was\nor is made or is threatened to be made a\nparty, or is otherwise involved in any action,\nsuit or proceeding,\nwhether civil, criminal, administrative or\ninvestigative, by reason of the fact that he\nor she, or a person for whom he or she is the\nlegal representative, is or was a director or\nofficer of GreenSky (or, while a director or\nofficer of GreenSky, is\nor was serving as a director, officer,\nemployee or agent of another entity at the\nrequest of GreenSky), against all liability\nand loss suffered and expenses (including\nattorneys\u0092 fees) reasonably incurred by such\nperson. The GreenSky bylaws\nfurther provide for the advancement of the\nexpenses (including attorneys\u0092 fees) incurred\nby any such person in defending any proceeding\nin advance of its final disposition; provided,\n\n-96-\n\nhowever, that, to the extent required by law,\nsuch advancement shall be made only upon\nreceipt of an undertaking by such person to\nrepay all amounts advanced if it should be\nultimately determined\nthat he or she is not entitled to be\nindemnified under the GreenSky bylaws or\notherwise.\n\nGreenSky has also entered into indemnification\nagreements with each of its directors and\nexecutive officers. These agreements require\nGreenSky to indemnify these individuals to the\nfullest extent permitted under Delaware law\nagainst liabilities that may arise by reason\nof their service to\nGreenSky, and to advance expenses incurred as\na result of any proceeding against them as to\nwhich they could be indemnified.\n\nPursuant to\nthe terms of the merger agreement, GreenSky\ndirectors and executive officers will be\nentitled to certain ongoing indemnification\nand coverage under directors\u0092 and officers\u0092\nliability insurance policies following the\nmergers. For a more\ndetailed description of the provisions of the\nmerger agreement relating to director and\nofficer indemnification, please see the\nsection entitled \u0093The Merger\nAgreement\u0097Indemnification and Insurance\u0094\nbeginning on page 117 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nContinuing Employee Benefits\n\nAs described in the section below entitled\n\u0093The Merger Agreement\u0097Employee Matters\u0094\nbeginning on page 119 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, the merger agreement\nrequires GS Group to continue to provide\ncertain compensation and benefits for not less\nthan one year following the effective time to\nall GreenSky employees,\nincluding GreenSky named executive officers\nand the other covered employees, who remain\nemployed by GS Group following the effective\ntime.\n\nArrangements with GS Group\n\nAs of\nthe date hereof, none of GreenSky\u0092s named\nexecutive officers, other than Mr. Zalik, with\nrespect to the holdback agreement (described\nmore fully in the section entitled \u0093\u0097 Holdback\nAgreement\u0094 beginning on page 99 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus), or other covered\nemployees has entered into any agreement with\nGS Group regarding employment with GS Group\nfollowing the effective time, including with\nrespect to the treatment of their GreenSky\nrestricted stock. Prior to or following the\neffective time, Mr. Zalik is expected to, in\naccordance with GS Group policies, enter into\na standard agreement for an employee of his\nlevel regarding his\nemployment with the GS Group, and certain\nother of GreenSky\u0092s named executive officers\nand certain of the other covered employees may\nhave discussions, or may enter into agreements\nwith, GS Group regarding employment with GS\nGroup.\n\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits\n\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation\nS-K, the table below sets forth for each\nGreenSky named executive officer estimates of\nthe amounts of compensation that are based on\nor otherwise relate to the mergers and that\nwill or may be paid or become payable to such\nGreenSky named executive officer either\nimmediately at the\neffective time (i.e., on a \u0093single-trigger\u0094\nbasis) or in the event of a qualifying\ntermination of employment following the\nmergers (i.e., on a \u0093double-trigger\u0094 basis).\nGreenSky stockholders are being asked to\napprove, on a non-binding, advisory basis,\nsuch compensation for the GreenSky named\nexecutive officers. Because the vote to\napprove such compensation is an advisory vote,\nit will not be binding on\neither GreenSky, the GreenSky board or the GS\nGroup. Accordingly, if the proposal to adopt\nthe merger agreement is approved by the\nGreenSky stockholders and the mergers are\ncompleted, such compensation will be payable\nregardless of the outcome of\nthe vote to approve such compensation, subject\nonly to the conditions applicable thereto,\nwhich are described in the footnotes to the\ntables below and above under this section.\n\nThe potential payments in the tables below are\nquantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of\nRegulation S-K. The estimated values are based\non (a) an assumption that the effective time\noccurs on December 31, 2021, which is the\nassumed closing date only for purposes of this\ncompensation-related disclosure, (b) an\nassumed value for the merger consideration of\n$11.51, which is the average closing price of\na share of GreenSky common stock over the\nfirst five trading days following the first\npublic announcement of the\nmerger agreement on September 15, 2021, (c)\nthe GreenSky named executive officers\u0092 salary\nand total eligible cash bonus levels as in\neffect as of the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, (d) the GreenSky equity\nawards held\n\n-97-\n\nby the named executive officers on September\n30, 2021, less any awards expected to vest in\nthe ordinary course prior to December 31,\n2021, and assuming no additional grants or\nforfeitures of GreenSky equity awards prior to\nDecember 31, 2021, and (e) an assumption that\neach GreenSky named executive officer\nexperiences a \u0093qualifying termination\u0094\nimmediately following the effective time. As\nsuch, the amounts indicated below are\nestimates based on multiple assumptions that\nmay or may not actually occur, including\nassumptions described in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, and do not reflect\ncertain compensation actions that may occur\nbefore the effective time. As a result, the\nactual amounts, if any, actually received by a\nGreenSky named executive officer may\nmaterially differ from the amounts set forth\nbelow.

The commitment letter\nprovides that the definitive agreements for\nthe purchase facility will contain customary\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants,\nindemnification and termination provisions.\n-99-\n\nTax Receivable Agreement Amendment\n\nAs a condition to GS Group\u0092s and GS Bank\u0092s\nentry into the merger agreement, GreenSky and\ncertain beneficiaries party to the tax\nreceivable agreement were required to enter\ninto an amendment to the tax receivable\nagreement amendment, which provided that no\npayments under the tax receivable agreement\nwill be made following or as a result of the\nconsummation of the mergers.\n\nRegulatory Approvals\n\nThe consummation of the mergers is subject to\nantitrust review in the United States. Under\nthe HSR Act, and the rules promulgated\nthereunder,\nthe mergers cannot be completed until the\nparties to the merger agreement have given\nnotification and furnished information to the\nFTC and the DOJ, and until the applicable\nwaiting period has expired or has been\nterminated. At any time before or\nafter consummation of the mergers,\nnotwithstanding the termination of the\napplicable waiting period under the HSR Act,\nthe FTC, the DOJ or any state could take such\naction under antitrust laws as it deems\nnecessary or desirable in the public\ninterest, including seeking to enjoin the\nconsummation of the mergers or seeking the\ndivestiture of substantial assets of GreenSky,\nGS Group or their respective subsidiaries.\nPrivate parties may also seek to take legal\naction under antitrust laws\nunder certain circumstances.\n\nThe consummation of the mergers is also\nsubject to certain other regulatory\nauthorizations, consents,\norders, non-objections and approvals with\ngovernmental authorities, including approval\nof the DFS and certain state licensing\napprovals.\n\nIn connection with the mergers, GS Group has\nfiled a registration statement on Form S-4\nwith the SEC\nunder the Securities Act, of which this proxy\nstatement/prospectus forms a part, that must\nbe declared effective by the SEC and pursuant\nto which the issuance of shares of GS Group\ncommon stock issuable upon the effective time\nwill be registered\nwith the SEC.\n\nIn addition, the consummation of the mergers\nis subject to approval for listing of the\nshares of GS Group common stock to\nbe issued in connection with the mergers and\nreserved for issuance in connection with the\nmergers on the NYSE, subject to official\nnotice of issuance.\n\nAccounting Treatment\n\nGS Group prepares its financial statements in\naccordance with GAAP. The mergers will be\naccounted for using the acquisition method of\naccounting. GS Group will be treated as the\nacquirer for accounting purposes.\n\nNo Appraisal or Dissenters\u0092 Rights\n\nIn accordance with the DGCL, which governs the\ncompany merger, no appraisal rights are\navailable to the\nGreenSky stockholders in connection with the\ncompany merger.\n\nDelisting and Deregistration of GreenSky Class\nA Common Stock\n\nPrior to completion of the mergers, GreenSky\nhas agreed to cooperate with GS Group and\nshall use\nits reasonable best efforts to cause the\nshares of GreenSky Class A common stock to be\nde-listed from NASDAQ and deregistered under\nthe Exchange Act as soon as reasonably\npracticable following the\neffective time of the mergers. If the mergers\nare completed, GreenSky Class A common stock\nwill be delisted from the NASDAQ and\nderegistered under the Exchange Act, and\nGreenSky will no longer be required to file\nperiodic reports with the SEC\nwith respect to GreenSky Class A common stock.\n\nNYSE Market Listing\n\nThe shares of GS Group common stock to be\nissued in the mergers will be listed for\ntrading on the NYSE. Prior to completion of\nthe mergers, GS\nGroup has agreed to use its best efforts to\ncause the shares of GS Group common stock to\nbe issued in connection with the mergers to be\napproved for listing on the NYSE, subject to\nofficial notice of issuance.\n\n-100-\n\nTHE MERGER AGREEMENT\n\nThis section describes the material terms of\nthe merger agreement. The description in this\nsection and elsewhere in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to the complete text of\nthe merger agreement, a copy of which is\nattached asAnnex Aand is incorporated by\nreference into this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. This summary does not\npurport to be complete and may not contain all\nof the information about the merger agreement\nthat is important to you. You are encouraged\nto read the merger agreement carefully and in\nits entirety. This section is not intended to\nprovide you with any factual information about\nGS Group or GreenSky. Such information can be\nfound elsewhere in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus and in the public filings\nGS Group and GreenSky make with the SEC, as\ndescribed in the section entitled \u0093 Where You\nCan Find More Information\u0094 beginning on page\n163 of this proxy statement/prospectus.\n\nExplanatory Note Regarding the Merger\nAgreement\n\nThe merger agreement and this summary of its\nterms are included to provide you\nwith information regarding the terms of the\nmerger agreement. Factual disclosures about GS\nGroup and GreenSky contained in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus or in the public reports\nof GS Group and GreenSky filed with the SEC\nmay supplement, update or\nmodify the factual disclosures about GS Group\nand GreenSky contained in the merger\nagreement. The representations, warranties and\ncovenants made in the merger agreement by the\nparties thereto were qualified and subject to\nimportant limitations\nagreed to by the parties in connection with\nnegotiating the terms of the merger agreement.\nIn particular, in your review of the\nrepresentations and warranties contained in\nthe merger agreement and described in this\nsummary, it is important to bear\nin mind that the representations and\nwarranties were negotiated with the principal\npurpose of establishing circumstances in which\na party to the merger agreement may have the\nright not to consummate the mergers if the\nrepresentations and warranties\nof the other party or parties prove to be\nuntrue due to a change in circumstance or\notherwise, and allocating risk between the\nparties to the merger agreement, rather than\nestablishing matters as facts. The\nrepresentations and warranties also may be\nsubject to a contractual standard of\nmateriality different from that generally\napplicable to stockholders and reports and\ndocuments filed with the SEC and some were\nqualified by the matters contained in the\nconfidential disclosures that the parties\ndelivered in connection with the merger\nagreement, which disclosures were not\nreflected in the merger agreement. Moreover,\ninformation concerning the subject matter of\nthe representations and warranties, which do\nnot purport to be accurate as of the\ndate of this proxy statement/prospectus, may\nhave changed since the date of the merger\nagreement. Accordingly, the representations,\nwarranties, and covenants or any descriptions\nof those provisions should not be read alone,\nbut instead should be\nread together with the information provided\nelsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus\nand in the documents incorporated by reference\ninto this proxy statement/prospectus.

GS\nGroup and GS Bank agreed to promptly take all\nactions necessary to secure the expiration or\ntermination of any applicable waiting period\nunder the HSR Act or\nany other antitrust law and resolve any\nobjections asserted with respect to the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement under the Federal Trade Commission\nAct or any other applicable law raised by any\ngovernmental authority, in order to\nprevent the entry of, or to have vacated,\nlifted, reversed or overturned, any judgment\nenacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended\nor enforced by any governmental entity or any\napplicable law that would prevent, prohibit,\nrestrict or delay the\nconsummation of the transactions contemplated\nby the merger agreement.\n\nGS Group and GS Bank will respond to and seek\nto resolve as\npromptly as reasonably practicable any\nobjections asserted by any governmental\nauthority related to the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement.\nGreenSky, GreenSky Holdings, GS Group, GS\nBank, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 and their\n\n-116-\n\nrespective affiliates will not take any action\nwith the intention to, or that would\nreasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the\nexpiration or termination of any waiting\nperiod under the HSR\nAct or the obtaining of approval of the FTC or\nthe DOJ, as necessary, or certain other\nregulatory authorizations, consents, orders,\nnon-objections and approvals with governmental\nauthorities, including the\napproval of the DFS and certain state\nlicensing approvals. Nothing in the merger\nagreement requires any party thereto to take\nor agree to take any action with respect to\nits business or operations unless the\neffectiveness of such agreement or action\nis conditioned upon the closing.

required by law, the certificate of\nformation and the limited liability company\nagreement of Surviving LLC 1 and the\norganizational documents of its subsidiaries\nto contain provisions no less favorable to\nsuch persons with respect to\nlimitation of liabilities, indemnification and\nexculpation, in each case, of members,\nmanagers, directors and officers than are set\nforth as of the date of the merger agreement\nin the GreenSky charter and the GreenSky\nbylaws and the organizational\ndocuments of such subsidiaries as in effect on\nthe date of the merger agreement, which\nprovisions may not be amended, repealed or\notherwise modified in a manner that would\nadversely affect the rights thereunder of such\npersons. In addition, from the\neffective time, GS Group and GS Bank will, and\nwill cause Surviving LLC 1 and Surviving LLC 2\nto, without requiring a preliminary\ndetermination of entitlement to\nindemnification, advance any expenses\n(including reasonable fees and expenses of\nlegal\ncounsel) of any such indemnified person under\nthe merger agreement (including in connection\nwith enforcing the indemnity and other\nobligations referred to in the merger\nagreement) as incurred to the fullest extent\npermitted under applicable law;\nprovided that any such indemnified person to\nwhom expenses are advanced provides an\nundertaking by or on behalf of such\nindemnified person to repay such amount if it\nshall be ultimately determined that such\nindemnified person is not entitled to be\nindemnified by GreenSky as authorized by the\nmerger agreement.\n\nThe merger agreement requires Surviving LLC 1\nto maintain, for a period of\nsix years, subject to certain extensions,\ncommencing immediately after the effective\ntime, GreenSky\u0092s current directors\u0092 and\nofficers\u0092 liability insurance covering acts or\nomissions occurring at or prior to the\neffective time with\nrespect to those individuals who are currently\n(and any additional individuals who prior to\nthe effective time become) covered by\nGreenSky\u0092s directors\u0092 and officers\u0092 liability\ninsurance policies on terms and scope with\nrespect to such\ncoverage, and in amount, no less favorable to\nsuch individuals than those of such policy in\neffect on the date of the merger agreement (or\nGS Group may substitute therefor policies,\nissued by reputable insurers, of at least the\nsame coverage with\nrespect to matters existing or occurring prior\nto the effective time, including a \u0093tail\u0094\npolicy); provided, however, that prior to the\neffective time, GreenSky will use its\ncommercially reasonable efforts to purchase a\nsix-year prepaid \u0093tail\u0094 policy on terms and\nconditions providing at least substantially\nequivalent benefits as the current policies of\ndirectors\u0092 and officers\u0092 liability insurance\nmaintained by\nGreenSky and its subsidiaries with respect to\nmatters existing or occurring prior to the\neffective time, covering, without limitation,\nthe transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement. The costs of such policy must not\nexceed, and in no event\nwill Surviving LLC 1 be obligated to expend,\non an annual basis, an amount in excess of\n300% of the aggregate annual premium paid by\nGreenSky for any such insurance contemplated\nby the merger agreement (which we refer to as\nthe \u0093premium\ncap\u0094), and if such premiums for such insurance\nwould at any time exceed the premium cap, then\nGreenSky or Surviving LLC 1, as applicable,\nwill purchase, and Surviving LLC 1 will cause\nto be maintained, policies of insurance which,\nin Surviving\nLLC 1\u0092s good faith determination, provide the\nmaximum coverage available at an annual\npremium equal to the premium cap.\n\n-118-\n\nThe obligations of GS Group, GS Bank,\nSurviving LLC 1 and Surviving LLC 2 with\nrespect to\nindemnification under the merger agreement\nwill not be terminated or modified in such a\nmanner as to adversely affect the rights of\nany indemnifiable party to whom such\nprovisions apply unless (x) such termination\nor modification is required by\napplicable law or (y) the affected\nindemnifiable party shall have consented in\nwriting to such termination or modification.\n\nIn the\nevent that (i) GS Group, GS Bank, Surviving\nLLC 1, Surviving LLC 2 or any of their\nrespective successors or assigns (A)\nconsolidates with or merges into any other\nentity and is not the continuing or surviving\ncorporation or entity of such\nconsolidation or merger or (B) transfers or\nconveys all or substantially all of its\nproperties and assets to any entity, or (ii)\nGS Group, GS Bank or any of their respective\nsuccessors or assigns dissolves Surviving LLC\n1 or Surviving LLC\n2, then, and in each such case, proper\nprovision shall be made so that the

agreement.\n\nEmployee Matters\n\nExcept as otherwise agreed among the parties,\nfor a period of not less than one year\nfollowing the effective time, GS Group will,\nand will\ncause Surviving LLC 1, Surviving LLC 2 and\ntheir respective subsidiaries to, provide\ncontinuing employees of GreenSky and its\nsubsidiaries with (a) a base salary or wage\nrate and bonus and other short-term

other bonus related to\nthe transactions contemplated\nby the merger agreement), (b) long-term\nincentive opportunities that are substantially\ncomparable to those provided to similarly-\nsituated employees of GS Bank and its\naffiliates and (c) employee benefits\n(excluding base salary, wage rate and\nbonus and other short-term incentive\nopportunities and long-term incentive\nopportunities, but including severance\nbenefits) that are substantially comparable in\nthe aggregate to those provided to such\ncontinuing employees immediately prior to the\neffective time (provided that each continuing\nemployee of GreenSky and its subsidiaries will\nparticipate in the applicable GS Group\nseverance plan or policy following the closing\non the same terms and conditions as other\nsimilarly situated employees\nof GS Group and its affiliates (subject to\nseverance benefits applicable to certain\nemployees of GreenSky and its subsidiaries\npursuant to GreenSky benefit plans in effect\nat

of its\nsubsidiaries (and applicable predecessor\nentity) will be treated as service with GS\nGroup, GS Bank, Surviving LLC\n1, Surviving LLC 2 and their respective\nsubsidiaries, as applicable (except to the\nextent such recognition would result in\nduplication of benefits).\n\nGS Group and GS Bank will, or will cause\nSurviving LLC 1, Surviving LLC 2 and their\nrespective subsidiaries to, (a) waive or cause\nto be\nwaived any pre-existing condition limitations,\nexclusions, actively-at-work requirements and\nwaiting periods under any welfare\nbenefit plan for which continuing

Any\nagreement on the part of a party to any\nextension or waiver must be in writing and\nsigned on behalf of such party.\n\nFees and Expenses\n\nWhether or not the mergers are consummated,\nall fees and expenses incurred in connection\nwith the merger agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby will be paid by the party\nincurring or required to incur such fees or\nexpenses, except as otherwise expressly set\nforth in the merger agreement.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe merger agreement is governed by, and will\nbe construed in accordance with, the laws of\nthe State of Delaware applicable to contracts\nexecuted in and to be performed entirely\nwithin that state, regardless of the laws that\nmight otherwise govern under any applicable\nconflicts of law principles.\n\nSpecific Enforcement\n\nThe parties to the merger agreement agreed\nthat irreparable damage for which monetary\nrelief, even if available, would not be an\nadequate\nremedy, would occur if any provision of the\nmerger agreement were not performed in\naccordance with the specific terms thereof or\nis otherwise breached and, accordingly, that\nthe parties will be entitled to specific\nperformance of the terms of the\nmerger agreement, including an injunction or\ninjunctions or other equitable relief to\nprevent breaches of the merger agreement or to\nenforce specifically the performance of the\nterms and provisions thereof (including the\nparties\u0092 obligation to\nconsummate the mergers) in the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware\ndeclines to accept jurisdiction over any legal\nor administrative proceeding, suit,\ninvestigation, arbitration or action,\nany state or federal court within the State of\nDelaware), in addition to any other remedy to\nwhich they are entitled at law or in equity.\nThe parties further agreed to waive any\nrequirement for the securing or posting of any\nbond in connection with\nsuch remedy and not to assert that a remedy of\nspecific enforcement is unenforceable,\ninvalid, contrary to applicable law or\ninequitable for any reason, and not to assert\nthat a remedy of monetary damages would\nprovide an adequate remedy or that the\nparties otherwise have an adequate remedy at\nlaw.\n\nIf, prior to the outside date, any party to\nthe merger agreement brings any action, in\neach case, in accordance with the merger\nagreement, to enforce specifically the\nperformance of the terms and provisions\nthereof by any other party, the outside date\nwill automatically be extended (a) for the\nperiod during which such action is\npending, plus 20 business days or (b) by such\nother time period established by the court\npresiding over such action, as the case may\nbe.\n\n-123-\n\nMATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX\nCONSEQUENCES The following discussion\nsummarizes the material United States federal\nincome tax consequences of (a) the company\nmerger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of\nGreenSky Class A common stock who exchange\ntheir GreenSky Class A common stock for shares\nof GS Group common stock (and cash in lieu of\nfractional shares of GS Group common stock, if\nany) pursuant to the company merger, (b) the\nHoldings merger to U.S. holders of Common\nUnits who exchange their Common Units for\nshares of GS Group common stock (and cash in\nlieu of fractional shares of GS Group common\nstock, if any) pursuant to the Holdings\nmerger, and (c) the ownership and disposition\nof GS Group common stock that U.S. holders\nreceive upon the consummation of the mergers.\nThis discussion is based on the provisions of\nthe Code, the U.S. Treasury Regulations\npromulgated thereunder and judicial and\nadministrative rulings, all as in effect as of\nthe date hereof and all of which are subject\nto change or varying interpretation, possibly\nwith retroactive effect. Any such changes\ncould affect the accuracy of the statements\nand conclusions set forth herein. This\ndiscussion is intended to provide only a\ngeneral summary of the material U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences of the mergers to\nGreenSky stockholders and holders of Common\nUnits and ownership and disposition of GS\nGroup common stock received in the mergers; it\nis not intended to be a complete analysis or\ndescription of all potential U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences of the mergers and\nownership and disposition of GS Group common\nstock received in the mergers. For purposes of\nthis discussion, the term \u0093U.S. holder\u0094 means\na beneficial owner of GreenSky Class A common\nstock or Common Units, as applicable, that is,\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n                                              \n      an individual citizen or resident of    \n      the United States;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      a corporation (including any entity     \n      treated as a corporation for U.S.       \n      federal income tax purposes) created    \n      or                                      \n      organized in or under the laws of the   \n      United States, any state thereof or     \n      the District of Columbia;               \n                                              \n                                              \n      a trust if (a)\u00a0its administration is    \n      subject to the primary supervision of   \n      a court within the United States        \n      and one or more U.S. persons have the   \n      authority to control all substantial    \n      decisions of the trust or (b)\u00a0it has a  \n      valid election in effect under          \n      applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations    \n      to be treated as a U.S. person; or      \n                                              \n                                              \n      an estate the income of which is        \n      subject to U.S. federal income tax      \n      regardless of its source.               \n                                              \nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes holds GreenSky Class A common stock\nor Common Units, the tax treatment of a\npartner in such partnership generally will\ndepend on the status of the partner and\nactivities of the partnership. Holders that\nare partners of a partnership holding GreenSky\nClass A common stock or Common Units, as\napplicable, should consult their own tax\nadvisors. This discussion assumes that\nGreenSky stockholders and holders of Common\nUnits hold their GreenSky Class A common stock\nand Common Units, as applicable, as capital\nassets within the meaning of Section 1221 of\nthe Code (generally, property held for\ninvestment). This discussion does not address\nall aspects of U.S. federal income taxation\nthat may be relevant to a GreenSky stockholder\nor GreenSky Holdings unitholder in light of\nsuch holder\u0092s particular circumstances, nor\ndoes it discuss the special considerations\napplicable to GreenSky stockholders or holders\nof Common Units subject to special treatment\nunder the U.S. federal income tax laws, such\nas, for example, financial institutions or\nbroker-dealers, mutual funds, tax-\nexemptorganizations, insurance companies,\ndealers in securities or foreign currencies,\ntraders in securities who elect the mark-to-\nmarketmethod of accounting, controlled foreign\ncorporations, passive foreign investment\ncompanies, U.S. expatriates, holders who\nacquired their GreenSky Class A common stock\nor Common Units through the exercise of\noptions or otherwise as compensation, holders\nwho hold their GreenSky Class A common stock\nor Common Units, as applicable, as part of a\nhedge, straddle, constructive sale or\nconversion transaction, U.S. holders whose\nfunctional currency is not the U.S. dollar,\nand holders who own or have owned (directly,\nindirectly or constructively) 5% or more (by\nvote or value) of GreenSky\u0092s stock or GreenSky\nHoldings\u0092 Common Units, as applicable. This\ndiscussion does not address any tax\nconsequences arising under the Medicare\ncontribution tax, nor does it address any\naspect of foreign, state, local, alternative\nminimum, estate, gift or other tax law that\nmay be applicable to a holder. -124-\n\nNeither GS Group nor GreenSky has obtained or\nwill obtain a ruling from the IRS regarding\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe mergers. Accordingly, there can be no\nassurance that the IRS will not take a\ncontrary position regarding the tax\nconsequences described in this discussion, or\nthat any such contrary position would not\nbe sustained.\n\nAll GreenSky stockholders and holders of\nCommon Units should consult their own tax\nadvisors to determine the particular tax\nconsequences to them in light of their\nparticular circumstances, including the\napplicability and effect of the alternative\nminimum tax and any U.S. federal, U.S. state\nor local, non-U.S.or other tax laws and of\npotential changes in such laws.\n\nTax Consequences of the Company Merger\n\nBased on representations as to the company\nmerger and the facts related thereto delivered\nto each of Cravath and S&C from each of\nGreenSky\nand GS Group, it is the opinion of Cravath and\nS&C that the company merger should qualify as\na \u0093reorganization\u0094 within the meaning of\nSection 368(a) of the Code (a\n\u0093Reorganization\u0094). Accordingly, the exchange\nof GreenSky\nClass A common stock for shares of GS Group\ncommon stock should be tax-free to U.S.\nholders, except with respect to any cash\nreceived in lieu of fractional shares of GS\nGroup common stock (as discussed\nbelow). A U.S. holder\u0092s aggregate tax basis in\nGS Group common stock received in the company\nmerger should equal such U.S. holder\u0092s\naggregate adjusted tax basis in the GreenSky\nClass A common stock exchanged therefor, less\nany basis\nattributable to fractional shares sold for\ncash, as discussed below. A U.S. holder\u0092s\nholding period for GS Group common stock\nreceived in the company merger should include\nthe U.S. holder\u0092s holding period in respect of\nthe GreenSky\nClass A common stock exchanged for such GS\nGroup common stock.\n\nIf a U.S. holder of GreenSky Class A common\nstock acquired\ndifferent blocks of GreenSky Class A common\nstock at different times or at different\nprices, such U.S. holder\u0092s basis and holding\nperiod in its shares of GS Group common stock\nmay be determined separately with reference to\neach block of\nGreenSky Class A common stock. Any such U.S.\nholder should consult its tax advisor\nregarding the tax bases and holding periods of\nthe particular shares of GS Group common stock\nreceived in the company merger.\n\nThe receipt of cash in lieu of fractional\nshares of GS Group common stock generally will\nbe treated as if the U.S. holder received the\nfractional share of GS Group common stock,\nwith the consequences described in the first\nparagraph of this section, and then sold such\nfractional share of GS Group common stock for\nthe applicable amount of cash. Accordingly,\nthe U.S. holder should\nrecognize gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the amount of cash received and such\nU.S. holder\u0092s basis in the fractional share of\nsuch common stock. Such gain or loss generally\nwill be capital gain or loss, which is taxed\nat\npreferential rates with respect to a non-\ncorporate U.S. holder that has a holding\nperiod greater than one year.\n\nAs discussed above, the parties\u0092 tax counsels\nare of the opinion that the company merger\nshould qualify as a Reorganization. As\ndescribed\nabove in the section entitled \u0093The Merger\nAgreement\u0097Certain Tax Matters\u0094, beginning on\npage 120 of this proxy statement/prospectus\nthe parties will not knowingly take or fail to\ntake any action\nthat would reasonably be expected to prevent\nor impede the company merger from such\nqualification. However, such opinions are not\nbinding on the IRS or any court, nor is the\nreceipt of further opinions a condition to the\nclosing. If it is\ndetermined that the company merger does not\nqualify as a Reorganization, the company\nmerger would be a taxable transaction to\nGreenSky stockholders for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. In that case, a U.S. holder\nwould generally recognize capital\ngain or loss measured by the difference\nbetween (a) the sum of (i) the fair market\nvalue (in U.S. dollars) of GS Group common\nstock received in exchange for such U.S.\nholder\u0092s GreenSky Class A common stock and\n(ii) any cash\nreceived in lieu of fractional shares of GS\nGroup common stock, and (b) such U.S. holder\u0092s\nbasis in the shares of GreenSky Class A common\nstock it holds. Such capital gain or loss\nwould be long-term capital gain or loss if, at\nthe\ntime of the exchange, such U.S. holder\u0092s\nholding period in its GreenSky Class A common\nstock was greater than one year. A U.S.\nholder\u0092s tax basis in shares of GS Group\ncommon stock received in the company merger\nwould be the fair\nmarket value (in U.S.\n\n-125-\n\ndollars) of those shares on the date such U.S.\nholder received them. The U.S. holder\u0092s\nholding period for shares of GS Group common\nstock received in the company merger would\nbegin on the\nday after the date such U.S. holder received\nsuch shares.\n\nTax Consequences of the Holdings Merger\n\nTax Characterization of the Holdings Merger\n\nThe exchange of Common Units for shares of GS\nGroup common stock (and cash in lieu of\nfractional shares of GS Group common stock, if\nany) in\nthe Holdings merger will be a taxable sale of\na U.S. holder\u0092s Common Units in exchange for\nshares of GS Group common stock (and any cash\nreceived in lieu of fractional shares of GS\nGroup common stock).\n\nAmount and Character of Gain or Loss\nRecognized\n\nA U.S. holder of Common Units who receives GS\nGroup common stock (and cash in lieu of\nfractional shares of GS Group common stock, if\nany) in\nexchange for Common Units pursuant to the\nHoldings merger will recognize gain or loss in\nan amount equal to the difference between (a)\nthe sum of (x) the fair market value of the GS\nGroup common stock received, (y) any cash\nreceived\n(including any cash in lieu of fractional\nshares of GS Group common stock) and (z) such\nU.S. holder\u0092s share of Holdings\u0092 liabilities\nimmediately prior to the Holdings merger and\n(b) such U.S. holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in\nthe Common Units exchanged therefor (which\nwill include such U.S. holder\u0092s share of\nHoldings\u0092 liabilities immediately prior to the\nHoldings merger).\n\nSuch gain or loss will generally be capital\ngain or loss. However, a portion of such gain\nor loss, which portion could be substantial,\nwill be\nseparately computed and taxed as ordinary\nincome or loss under Section 751 of the Code\nto the extent attributable to assets giving\nrise to depreciation recapture or other\n\u0093unrealized receivables\u0094 or to \u0093inventory\nitems\u0094\n(each as defined in the Code) owned by\nHoldings and its subsidiaries. Ordinary income\nattributable to unrealized receivables\n(including depreciation recapture) and\ninventory items may exceed any net taxable\ngain realized by a U.S. holder of Common\nUnits in connection with the Holdings merger\nand may be recognized even if there is a net\ntaxable loss realized by such U.S. holder in\nconnection with the Holdings merger.\nConsequently, a U.S. holder may recognize both\nordinary income and capital\nloss upon the exchange of Common Units in\nconnection with the Holdings merger. Capital\ngain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder of\nCommon Units will generally be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the U.S. holder\u0092s\nholding period for its Common\nUnits is more than one year as of the\neffective time of the Holdings merger. Long-\nterm capital gains of certain non-corporate\nholders, including individuals, are generally\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax at\nreduced rates. The deductibility of capital\nlosses is subject to limitation. Passive\nlosses that were not deductible by a U.S.\nholder in prior taxable periods because they\nexceeded the U.S. holder\u0092s share of Holdings\u0092\nincome generally can\nbe deducted in full upon the U.S. holder\u0092s\ntaxable disposition of its entire investment\nin Holdings pursuant to the Holdings merger.\n\nThe amount of gain or loss recognized by a\nU.S. holder in the Holdings merger will vary\ndepending on the U.S. holder\u0092s particular\nsituation, including the adjusted tax basis of\nthe Common Units exchanged by the U.S. holder\nin the Holdings merger, and the amount of any\nsuspended passive losses that may be available\nto the U.S. holder to offset a portion of the\ngain recognized\nby it. Each U.S. holder is strongly urged to\nconsult its own tax advisor with respect to\nthe specific tax consequences of the Holdings\nmerger to such holder, taking into account its\nown particular circumstances.\n\nTax Basis and Holding Period in GS Group\nCommon Stock Received in the Holdings Merger\n\nA U.S. holder\u0092s tax basis in the GS Group\ncommon stock received in the Holdings merger\nwill equal the fair market value of such GS\nGroup\ncommon stock on the date of the Holdings\nmerger. A U.S. holder\u0092s holding period in the\nGS Group common stock received in the Holdings\nmerger will begin on the day after the date of\nthe Holdings merger.\n\n-126-\n\nPre-ClosingPartnership Items of Income, Gain,\nLoss and Deduction\n\nU.S. holders of Common Units will continue to\nbe allocated their share of Holdings\u0092 items of\nincome, gain, loss and\ndeduction for any pre-closing taxable period\nof Holdings, including the taxable period\nending on the date of the effectiveness of the\nHoldings merger. These allocations will be\nmade in accordance with the\nterms of the GreenSky Holdings operating\nagreement. A U.S. holder will be subject to\nU.S. federal income tax on any such allocated\nincome and gain. Any such income and gain\nallocated to a U.S. holder will increase the\nU.S. holder\u0092s tax basis in\nits Common Units and, therefore, will reduce\nthe gain, or increase the loss, recognized by\nsuch U.S. holder resulting from the Holdings\nmerger. Any losses or deductions allocated to\na U.S. holder will decrease the U.S. holder\u0092s\ntax basis in its\nCommon Units and, therefore, will increase the\ngain, or reduce the loss, recognized by such\nU.S. holder resulting from the Holdings\nmerger.\n\nU.S. holders of Common Units will continue to\nreceive quarterly tax distributions with\nrespect to taxable income allocated to them as\nwell as\nan estimated tax distribution at closing with\nrespect to any taxable income allocated to\nthem for which a prior tax distribution was\nnot made, in each case, determined in\naccordance with the applicable terms of the\nGreenSky Holdings operating\nagreement. Any such distributions will\ngenerally reduce the U.S. holder\u0092s tax basis\nin its Common Units. U.S. holders of Common\nUnits will also receive an additional \u0093true-\nup\u0094 payment from GS\nGroup no later than 10 business days after the\ndue date for the GreenSky Holdings tax return\nfor the pre-closing taxable period to the\nextent the estimated tax distribution at\nclosing was less than the final\namount of the distribution that would be due\nunder the GreenSky Holdings operating\nagreement. U.S. holders of Common Units should\nconsult their own tax advisors regarding the\nU.S. federal income tax treatment of these\npayments. For the avoidance of\ndoubt, there will not be any further\nobligations under the GreenSky Holdings\noperating agreement or the merger agreement to\nmake payments to U.S. holders of Common Units\nwith respect to taxes imposed on them as a\nresult of their ownership of Common\nUnits, including with respect to taxes imposed\nas a result of an audit.\n\nOwnership of GS Group Common Stock Received in\nthe Mergers\n\nDistributions on GS Group Common Stock\n\nDistributions, if any, paid on GS Group common\nstock generally will be treated as dividends\nto the extent of GS Group\u0092s current or\naccumulated earnings and profits. Dividends\npaid to a non-corporate U.S. holder that\nconstitute qualified dividend income will be\ntaxable at preferential rates applicable to\nlong-term capital gains so long as\nthe holder holds the GS Group common stock for\nmore than 60 days during the 121-day period\nbeginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date\nand meets other holding period\nrequirements. Dividends paid with respect to\nGS Group common stock will generally be\nqualified dividend income, provided the\nholding period requirements in the previous\nsentence are satisfied. In addition, dividends\npaid to corporate U.S. holders\nmay qualify for the dividends received\ndeduction if the holder meets certain holding\nperiod and other requirements. Distributions\nin excess of GS Group\u0092s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits will be\ntreated as a return of capital to the\nextent of a U.S. holder\u0092s basis in GS Group\ncommon stock and thereafter as capital gain.\n\nSale or Other Disposition of GS Group Common\nStock\n\nA U.S. holder that sells or otherwise disposes\nof GS Group common stock will recognize\ncapital gain or loss for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes equal to the difference\nbetween the amount that the U.S. holder\nrealizes and the U.S. holder\u0092s tax basis in\nthose shares. Capital gain of a non-corporate\nU.S. holder is taxed at\npreferential rates when the holder has a\nholding period greater than one year. The\ndeduction of capital losses is subject to\nlimitations.\n\n-127-\n\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nA U.S. holder may, under certain\ncircumstances, be subject to information\nreporting and backup withholding (at a rate of\n24%) with respect to\ncertain amounts that it receives in the\nmergers, unless such holder properly\nestablishes an exemption or provides its\ncorrect tax identification number and\notherwise complies with the applicable\nrequirements of the backup withholding rules.\nBackup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namounts withheld under the backup withholding\nrules may be refunded or credited against a\npayee\u0092s U.S. federal income tax liability, if\nany, so long as such payee furnishes the\nrequired information\nto the IRS in a timely manner.\n\n-128-\n\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE GREENSKY SPECIAL MEETING\n\nDate, Time and Place\n\nThe special meeting will be held on [\u0097], at\n[\u0097], Eastern Time and will be conducted\ncompletely online via the internet.

In addition, GreenSky believes that a\nvirtual meeting will provide greater access to\nthose GreenSky stockholders who want to\nattend, will improve GreenSky\u0092s ability to\ncommunicate more effectively with its\nstockholders during the\nspecial meeting, and will eliminate the health\nrisks associated with an in-person meeting in\nlight of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPurpose of the Special Meeting\n\nAt the special meeting, GreenSky stockholders\nwill be asked to consider and vote on (i) the\nGreenSky merger proposal, (ii) the\nnon-binding compensation proposal and (iii)\nthe adjournment proposal.\n\nThe approval of the GreenSky merger proposal\nis a condition to\nclosing under the merger agreement, as the\nholders of a majority of the voting power of\nthe outstanding shares of GreenSky common\nstock entitled to vote thereon must adopt the\nmerger agreement in order for the mergers to\noccur.

The\nGreenSky board, acting on the unanimous\nrecommendation of the GreenSky special\ncommittee, (i) determined that it was in the\nbest interests of\n\n-129-\n\nGreenSky and its stockholders and declared it\nadvisable that GreenSky enter into the merger\nagreement and other related agreements and\nconsummate the transactions contemplated\nthereby,\n(ii) approved and adopted the merger agreement\nand other related agreements, (iii) resolved\nto recommend that GreenSky stockholders vote\nfor the adoption of the merger agreement and\n(iv) directed that the merger agreement and\nthe\ntransactions contemplated thereby be submitted\nto GreenSky stockholders for adoption.\n\nAccordingly, the GreenSky board, acting on the\nunanimous recommendation of the GreenSky\nspecial committee, recommends that holders of\nGreenSky common stock vote (i) \u0093FOR\u0094 the\nGreenSky merger proposal, (ii) \u0093FOR\u0094 the non-\nbindingcompensation proposal and (iii) \u0093FOR\u0094\nthe adjournment proposal.\n\nFor a discussion of the factors that the\nGreenSky board considered in determining to\nrecommend the adoption of the merger\nagreement, please\nsee the section entitled \u0093The\nMergers\u0097GreenSky\u0092s Reasons for the Mergers;\nRecommendation of the GreenSky Board of\nDirectors\u0094 beginning on page 67 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. In\naddition, in considering the recommendation of\nthe GreenSky board with respect to the merger\nagreement, you should be aware that some of\nGreenSky\u0092s directors and executive officers\nhave interests that may be different from, or\nin addition to,\nthe interests of the GreenSky stockholders\ngenerally. Please see the section of this\nproxy statement/prospectus entitled \u0093The\nMergers\u0097Interests of GreenSky\u0092s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Mergers\u0094 beginning\non page 94.\n\nThere are certain risks associated with the\nmergers. Please see the section entitled\n\u0093Risk Factors\u0094 beginning on page 30 of this\nproxy statement/prospectus for more\ninformation regarding such risks. GreenSky\nstockholders should read carefully this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, including\nthe attached annexes and any documents\nincorporated by reference, in its entirety for\nmore detailed information concerning the\nmergers. In particular, GreenSky stockholders\nare directed to the merger agreement, which is\nattached as Annex A to\nthis proxy statement/prospectus.\n\nRecord Date; Outstanding Shares; Shares\nEntitled to Vote\n\nGreenSky has set the close of business on [\u0097]\nas the record date for the special meeting,\nand only holders of record of GreenSky\nClass A common stock and GreenSky Class B\ncommon stock on the record date are entitled\nto vote at the special meeting. As of close of\nbusiness on the record date, there were [\u0097]\nshares of GreenSky common stock outstanding,\nconsisting\nof [\u0097] shares of GreenSky Class A common stock\nand [\u0097] shares of GreenSky Class B common\nstock. GreenSky Class A common stock and\nGreenSky Class B common stock will vote\ntogether as a single class on all matters\ndescribed in this proxy statement/prospectus\nfor which your vote is being solicited. On\neach matter properly brought before the\nspecial meeting, each holder of GreenSky Class\nA common stock is entitled to one vote per\nshare of GreenSky\nClass A common stock and each holder of\nGreenSky Class B common stock is entitled to\nten votes per share of GreenSky Class B common\nstock, in each case, held of record as of the\nrecord date. GreenSky common stock is the only\nsecurity\nthe holders of which are entitled to notice\nof, and to vote at, the special meeting.\n\nSome GreenSky stockholders hold their shares\nthrough\na bank, broker, trustee or other nominee\nrather than directly in their own name.\n\nStockholder of Record. If, as of the record\ndate,\nshares of GreenSky common stock are registered\ndirectly in your name with GreenSky\u0092s transfer\nagent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust\nCompany, then you are considered, with respect\nto those shares, the \u0093stockholder of\nrecord.\u0094 As the stockholder of record, you\nhave the right to grant your voting proxy\ndirectly to the individuals listed on the\nproxy card to vote live in person at the\nspecial meeting.\n\nBeneficial Owner. If, as of the record date,\nshares of GreenSky common stock are held in a\nbrokerage account or by a broker, bank,\ntrustee or other nominee, then you are\nconsidered the \u0093beneficial owner\u0094 of those\nshares that are held in \u0093street name.\u0094 As the\nbeneficial owner of those shares, you have the\nright to direct your\n\n-130-\n\nbank, broker, trustee or other nominee how to\nvote, and you also are invited to attend the\nspecial meeting. However, because a beneficial\nowner is not the stockholder of record, you\nmay not vote these shares live in person at\nthe special meeting unless you obtain a \u0093legal\nproxy\u0094 from the bank, broker, trustee or other\nnominee that holds your shares, giving you the\nright to vote the shares live in person at the\nspecial meeting. Quorum, Abstentions and\nBroker Non-Votes The holders of a majority of\nthe votes entitled to be cast by the GreenSky\nstockholders entitled to vote at the special\nmeeting, present in person or represented by\nproxy, constitutes a quorum for the purposes\nof the special meeting. \u0093Attending non-\nvotes\u0094or shares for which a GreenSky\nstockholder directs an \u0093abstention\u0094 from\nvoting, will each be counted for purposes of\ndetermining a quorum. \u0093Attending non-votes\u0094are\nshares of GreenSky common stock represented at\nthe special meeting by attendance via the\nspecial meeting website that are entitled to\nvote at the special meeting have not\npreviously voted and are not voted at the\nspecial meeting. Brokers who hold shares in\nstreet name for a beneficial owner of those\nshares typically have the authority to vote in\ntheir discretion on \u0093routine\u0094 proposals when\nthey have not received instructions from\nbeneficial owners. However, brokers are not\nallowed to exercise their voting discretion\nwith respect to the approval of matters that\nare \u0093non-routine\u0094without specific instructions\nfrom the beneficial owner. \u0093Broker non-\nvotes\u0094occur when shares held in street name\nare present at the special meeting but the\nbroker or nominee is not instructed by the\nbeneficial owner of shares to vote on a\nparticular proposal for which the broker does\nnot have discretionary voting power. Under\napplicable rules, each of the proposals to be\nvoted on at the special meeting will be \u0093non-\nroutine\u0094and therefore, it is expected that\nthere will be no broker non-votesat the\nspecial meeting. If you are a GreenSky\nstockholder and you do not instruct your bank,\nbroker, trustee or other nominee on how to\nvote your shares:\n                                              \n      your bank, broker, trustee or other     \n      nominee may not vote your shares on     \n      the GreenSky merger proposal, which     \n      will                                    \n      have the same effect as a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094  \n      this proposal;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      your bank, broker, trustee or other     \n      nominee may not vote your shares on     \n      the                                     \n      non-binding compensation proposal or    \n      the adjournment proposal, which will    \n      have no effect on the vote count of     \n      either of these proposals; and          \n                                              \n                                              \n      your shares will not be counted         \n      towards determining whether a quorum    \n      is present.                             \n                                              \nIf a quorum is not present, the special\nmeeting may be adjourned or postponed until\nthe holders of the number of shares of\nGreenSky common stock required to constitute a\nquorum attend, subject to the terms and\nconditions set forth in the merger agreement.\nVote Required Proposal 1.The GreenSky merger\nproposal requires the affirmative vote of the\nholders of a majority of the voting power of\nthe outstanding shares of GreenSky common\nstock entitled to vote thereon.

Proposal 2.The non-\nbindingcompensation proposal requires the\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority\nof the votes cast by the GreenSky stockholders\nentitled to vote on the proposal who are\npresent in person or represented by proxy. You\nmay vote \u0093 FOR,\u0094 \u0093 AGAINST\u0094 or \u0093 ABSTAIN\u0094 for\nthe non-bindingcompensation proposal. Complete\nfailures to vote, attending non-\nvotes,abstentions and broker non-voteswill\nhave no effect on the non-bindingcompensation\nproposal, assuming a quorum is present. -131-\n\nProposal 3.The adjournment proposal requires\nthe affirmative vote of the holders of a\nmajority of\nthe votes entitled to be cast by the GreenSky\nstockholders who are present in person or by\nproxy, whether or not a quorum is present. You\nmay vote \u0093FOR,\u0094 \u0093AGAINST\u0094 or \u0093ABSTAIN\u0094 for the\nadjournment\nproposal. Any abstentions and attending non-\nvoteswill have the same effect as a vote\n\u0093AGAINST\u0094 the adjournment proposal, and\ncomplete failures to vote and broker non-\nvoteswill have no effect on the adjournment\nproposal, in each case, whether or not a\nquorum is present.\n\nThe approval of the GreenSky merger proposal\nis a condition to closing under the merger\nagreement, as the holders of a majority of the\nvoting\npower of the outstanding shares of GreenSky\ncommon stock entitled to vote thereon must\nadopt the merger agreement in order for the\nmergers to occur. If GreenSky stockholders\nfail to approve the GreenSky merger proposal,\nthe mergers will not occur.\n\nOn September 14, 2021, concurrently with the\nexecution of the merger agreement and as a\ncondition to GS Group\u0092s and GS\nBank\u0092s entry into the merger agreement, David\nZalik, Chairman of the GreenSky board and\nGreenSky\u0092s Chief Executive Officer, and\ncertain of his affiliates, who, as of\nSeptember 30, 2021, collectively and in the\naggregate held voting\npower over approximately 56% of the\noutstanding GreenSky common stock, entered\ninto a voting agreement with GS Group and GS\nBank, pursuant to which they have agreed,\namong other things, to vote their shares of\nGreenSky common stock in favor of the\napproval of the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby at the\nspecial meeting, with certain exceptions (as\nfurther described in the section entitled \u0093The\nMergers\u0097Voting Agreement\u0094 beginning on page 99\nof this proxy statement/prospectus). As a\nresult, and subject to the terms of the voting\nagreement and certain exceptions therein, the\napproval of the GreenSky merger proposal is\neffectively assured.\nFurthermore, at the close of business on the\nrecord date, approximately [\u0097]% of the issued\nand outstanding shares of GreenSky Class A\ncommon stock and [\u0097]% of the issued and\noutstanding shares of GreenSky Class B common\nstock,\ncollectively accounting for approximately [\u0097]%\nof the total voting power of GreenSky common\nstock, was directly held by GreenSky\u0092s\ndirectors and executive officers other than\nMr. Zalik.

For the adoption of the merger\nagreement, you may vote \u0093FOR,\u0094 \u0093AGAINST\u0094 or\n\u0093ABSTAIN.\u0094 Complete failures to vote,\nattending non-votes,abstentions and broker\nnon-voteswill have the same effect as a vote\n\u0093AGAINST\u0094 the GreenSky merger proposal.\n\nThe vote on the GreenSky merger proposal is a\nvote separate and apart from the non-binding\ncompensation proposal and the adjournment\nproposal. Accordingly, you may vote in favor\nof the non-binding compensation proposal\nand/or adjournment proposal and vote not to\napprove GreenSky merger proposal and\nvice versa. The approval of the GreenSky\nmerger proposal is a condition to closing\nunder the merger agreement, as the holders of\na majority of the voting power of the\noutstanding shares of GreenSky common stock\nentitled to vote thereon must adopt\nthe merger agreement in order for the mergers\nto occur. If GreenSky stockholders fail to\napprove the GreenSky merger proposal, the\nmergers will not occur.\n\nThe GreenSky board, acting upon the unanimous\nrecommendation of the GreenSky special\ncommittee, recommends that GreenSky\nstockholders vote \u0093FOR\u0094 the GreenSky merger\nproposal.\n\n-136-\n\nProposal 2: Non-Binding(Advisory) Compensation\nProposal\n\nIn accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange\nAct, GreenSky is providing GreenSky\nstockholders with the opportunity to cast a\nnon-binding (advisory) vote on the\ncompensation that may be paid or become\npayable to GreenSky\u0092s named executive officers\nin\nconnection with the mergers. As required by\nthose rules, GreenSky is asking GreenSky\u0092s\nstockholders to vote on the approval of the\nfollowing resolution:\n\n\u0093RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be\npaid or become payable to GreenSky\u0092s named\nexecutive officers in connection with the\nmergers, as disclosed in the section entitled\n\u0093Quantification of Potential Payments and\nBenefits to GreenSky Named Executive Officers\u0094\nin the section of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus entitled \u0093The\nMergers\u0097Interests of GreenSky\u0092s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Mergers,\u0094 including\nthe associated narrative discussion, and the\nagreements or understandings pursuant to which\nsuch compensation may be paid or become\npayable, are hereby\nAPPROVED.\u0094\n\nVote Required\n\nThe non-binding compensation proposal requires\nthe affirmative vote of the holders of a\nmajority of the votes cast by the GreenSky\nstockholders entitled to vote on the proposal\nwho are present in person or represented\nby proxy. You may vote \u0093FOR,\u0094 \u0093AGAINST\u0094 or\n\u0093ABSTAIN\u0094 for the non-binding compensation\nproposal. Complete failures to vote, attending\nnon-votes,abstentions and broker non-\nvotes,will have no effect on the non-\nbindingcompensation proposal, assuming a\nquorum is present.\n\nThe vote on the non-binding compensation\nproposal is a vote separate and apart from\nthe GreenSky merger proposal and the\nadjournment proposal. Accordingly, you may\nvote in favor of the GreenSky merger proposal\nand/or adjournment proposal and vote not to\napprove the non-binding compensation\nproposal and vice versa. Because the non-\nbinding compensation proposal is only advisory\nin nature, it will not be binding on GreenSky\nor the GreenSky board. Accordingly, because\nGreenSky is contractually\nobligated to pay the compensation, such\ncompensation will be paid or become payable,\nsubject only to the conditions applicable\nthereto, if the mergers are consummated and\nregardless of the outcome of the advisory\nvote.\n\nThe GreenSky board, acting upon the unanimous\nrecommendation of the GreenSky special\ncommittee, recommends that you vote \u0093FOR\u0094 the\nnon-bindingcompensation proposal.\n\n-137-\n\nProposal 3: Adjournment Proposal\n\nGreenSky is asking its stockholders to approve\nthe adjournment of the special meeting from\ntime to time, if necessary or appropriate, to\nsolicit additional proxies in favor of the\nGreenSky merger proposal if there are\ninsufficient votes at the time of such\nadjournment to approve such proposal.\n\nIf, at the special meeting, the number of\nshares GreenSky common stock present or\nrepresented and voting in favor of the\nGreenSky merger\nproposal is insufficient to approve such\nproposal, GreenSky may move to adjourn the\nspecial meeting in order to enable the\nGreenSky board to solicit additional proxies\nfor approval of the GreenSky merger proposal.\n\nGreenSky is asking its stockholders to\nauthorize the holder of any proxy solicited by\nthe GreenSky board to vote in favor of\ngranting\ndiscretionary authority to the proxy holders,\nand each of them individually, to adjourn the\nspecial meeting to another time and place for\nthe purpose of soliciting additional proxies.\nIf the GreenSky stockholders approve this\nproposal, GreenSky\ncould adjourn the special meeting and any\nadjourned session of the special meeting\n(subject to the terms and conditions of the\nmerger agreement as described in the section\nentitled \u0093Information About the GreenSky\nSpecial Meeting\u0097Adjournments and\nPostponements\u0094 beginning on page 135 of this\nproxy statement/prospectus) and use the\nadditional time to solicit additional proxies,\nincluding the solicitation of proxies from\nGreenSky stockholders who have\npreviously voted.\n\nVote Required\n\nThe\nadjournment proposal requires the affirmative\nvote of the holders of a majority of the votes\nentitled to be cast by the GreenSky\nstockholders who are present in person or by\nproxy, whether or not a quorum is present. You\nmay vote\n\u0093FOR,\u0094 \u0093AGAINST\u0094 or \u0093ABSTAIN\u0094 for the\nadjournment proposal. Any abstentions and\nattending non-voteswill have the same effect\nas a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094 the adjournment proposal,\nand complete failures to vote and broker non-\nvoteswill have no effect on the adjournment\nproposal, in each case, whether or not a\nquorum is present.\n\nThe vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote\nseparate and apart from the GreenSky merger\nproposal and the\nnon-binding compensation proposal.\nAccordingly, you may vote in favor of the\nGreenSky merger proposal and/or the non-\nbinding compensation proposal and vote not to\napprove the adjournment proposal and vice\nversa. The approval of the adjournment\nproposal is not a condition to the\nconsummation of the mergers.\n\nThe GreenSky board, acting upon the unanimous\nrecommendation of the GreenSky special\ncommittee, recommends that you vote \u0093FOR\u0094\nadjournment proposal.\n\n-138-\n\nCERTAIN OTHER MATTERS\n\nCertain Prior Transactions between the Parties\n\nIn May 2018, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, an\naffiliate of GS Group, acted as a joint lead\nbookrunning manager in connection with\nGreenSky\u0092s initial public offering of GreenSky\nClass A common stock.\n\nIn September 2020, GS Group provided financing\nof\napproximately $260 million for a third-party\u0092s\nacquisition of participations in consumer\nfinance loans originated through the GreenSky\nprogram, and in October 2020 and May 2021, GS\nGroup acquired participations in approximately\n$380 million in aggregate outstanding\nprincipal balances of consumer finance loans\noriginated through the GreenSky program (with\nGS Group securitizing the participations that\nit acquired in August 2021), as described in\nthe section entitled\n\u0093The Mergers\u0097Background of the Transactions\u0094\nbeginning on page 41 of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nCertain Related Party Transactions with\nGreenSky\n\nMr. Robert Sheft, a GreenSky director and\nbeneficial owner of more than 5% of the\noutstanding Common\nUnits, is the owner, Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer of a company that is a\nmerchant in the GreenSky program. For the\nperiod from January 1, 2020 to September 30,\n2021, this company had approximately $7\nmillion in\ntransaction volume funded through the GreenSky\nprogram.\n\nSEC Matter Regarding GreenSky\n\nOn November 4, 2019, GreenSky received a\nrequest for information from the SEC with\nrespect to, among other things, GreenSky\u0092s\naccounting\nfor finance charge reversals in connection\nwith deferred interest loans. GreenSky is\ncooperating with the SEC in connection with\nthis investigation and is unable to predict\nthe outcome of this matter.\n\n-139-\n\nCOMPARISON OF EQUITYHOLDER RIGHTS\n\nHolders of shares of GreenSky Class A common\nstock and holders of Common Units will receive\nas the merger consideration shares of GS\nGroup common stock if the mergers are\nconsummated. GreenSky Holdings is a Georgia\nlimited liability company subject to the\nGLLCA. GS Group and GreenSky are both\nincorporated under the laws of the State of\nDelaware, and, accordingly, the rights of GS\nGroup and GreenSky stockholders are governed\nby Delaware law, including the DGCL. The\nfollowing summary compares the rights of\nGreenSky stockholders and holders of Common\nUnits to the rights of GS Group stockholders.\n\nRights of Holders of Common Units\n\nEach\nholder of shares of GreenSky Class B common\nstock holds an equal number of Common Units.\nIn accordance with the terms of the GreenSky\nHoldings operating agreement and the Exchange\nAgreement, dated as of May 23, 2018 (the\n\u0093GreenSky\nexchange agreement\u0094), among GreenSky Holdings,\nGreenSky and the members party thereto from\ntime to time, each holder of Common Units\ngenerally has the right to exchange his, her\nor its Common Units (with automatic\ncancellation of an equal\nnumber of shares of GreenSky Class B common\nstock) for shares of GreenSky Class A common\nstock on a one-for-one-basis,\nsubject to customary adjustment for certain\nsubdivisions (stock splits), combinations, or\npurchases of GreenSky Class A common stock or\nCommon Units, or for cash (based on the market\nprice of the shares of GreenSky Class A common\nstock),\nat GreenSky\u0092s option.\n\nPursuant to the GreenSky Holdings operating\nagreement, GreenSky Holdings is authorized to\nissue, from time to\ntime, such number of Common Units and other\nequity securities to maintain at all times a\none-to-one ratio between the number of Common\nUnits owned by GreenSky and the\nnumber of outstanding shares of GreenSky Class\nA common stock, disregarding certain types of\nGreenSky Class A common stock. In the event\nGreenSky issues, transfers or delivers from\ntreasury stock or repurchases GreenSky Class A\ncommon\nstock in a transaction not contemplated in the\nGreenSky Holdings operating agreement,\nGreenSky, acting in its capacity as the\nmanager of GreenSky Holdings, shall take all\nactions such that, after giving effect to all\nsuch issuances, transfers,\ndeliveries or repurchases, the number of\noutstanding Common Units owned by GreenSky\nwill equal on a one-for-one basis the number\nof outstanding shares of GreenSky\nClass A common stock. In the event GreenSky\nissues, transfers or delivers from treasury\nstock or repurchases or redeems GreenSky\u0092s\npreferred stock in a transaction not\ncontemplated in the GreenSky Holdings\noperating agreement, GreenSky\nshall have the authority to take all actions\nsuch that, after giving effect to all such\nissuances, transfers, deliveries, repurchases\nor redemptions, GreenSky holds (in the case of\nany issuance, transfer or delivery) or ceases\nto hold (in the case\nof any repurchase or redemption) equity\ninterests in GreenSky Holdings that (in the\ngood faith determination by GreenSky) are in\nthe aggregate substantially equivalent to the\noutstanding preferred stock of GreenSky so\nissued, transferred, delivered,\nrepurchased or redeemed. In addition,\nsimultaneously with any Common Unit split,\nCommon Unit distribution, reclassification,\nrecapitalization or similar event or\ncombination (by reverse Common Unit split,\nreclassification,\nrecapitalization or similar event) of the\nCommon Units, GreenSky shall implement a\ncomparable adjustment to the GreenSky Class B\ncommon stock so as to maintain at all times a\none-to-one ratio between the number of Common\nUnits owned by members other than GreenSky and\nthe number of outstanding shares of GreenSky\nClass B common stock.\n\nSubject to certain restrictions related to\ncertain regulated holders, all members of\nGreenSky Holdings are entitled to a vote on\nany matter\nsubmitted to a vote of the members pursuant to\nthe terms of the GreenSky Holdings operating\nagreement and as provided under the GLLCA.\nEach Common Unit held by a member carries one\nvote. Holders of certain incentive units\nissued under the GreenSky\nHoldings Equity Incentive Plan are not\nentitled to any voting rights.\n\nGreenSky is the sole manager of GreenSky\nHoldings. Except as\notherwise required by law and subject to any\nlimitations in GreenSky Holdings\u0092 Articles of\nOrganization and the GreenSky Holdings\noperating agreement, GreenSky has all the\nrights and powers to manage and direct the\naffairs of GreenSky Holdings,\nincluding the\n\n-140-\n\npowers to make all arrangements and do all\nthings which are necessary or convenient to\nthe conduct, promotion or attainment of the\nbusiness, purposes or activities of GreenSky\nHoldings, and no member (acting solely in its\ncapacity as such) has any authority to bind\nGreenSky Holdings to any third-party with\nrespect to any matter except pursuant to a\nresolution expressly authorizing such action,\nwhich resolution is duly adopted by GreenSky.\nUnder the GreenSky Holdings operating\nagreement, GreenSky acknowledges that it owes\nto the members of GreenSky Holdings the same\nfiduciary duties it would owe to stockholders\nunder the DGCL were GreenSky Holdings a\nDelaware corporation. GreenSky takes action\nthrough the GreenSky board, and, as discussed\nbelow, the members of the GreenSky board owe\nfiduciary duties to GreenSky stockholders.\nComparison of Stockholder Rights The following\nis a summary of certain material differences\nbetween (a) the current rights of GreenSky\nstockholders under the GreenSky charter,\nGreenSky bylaws, and Delaware law, including\nthe DGCL, and (b) the current rights of GS\nGroup stockholders under the GS Group charter,\nthe GS Group by-laws,and Delaware law,\nincluding the DGCL, which will govern the\nrights of GreenSky stockholders who become GS\nGroup stockholders following the mergers. The\nfollowing summary is not a complete statement\nof the rights of holders of the two companies\u0092\ncapital stock or a complete description of the\nspecific provisions referred to below. This\nsummary is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to GreenSky\u0092s and GS Group\u0092s\ngoverning documents, which we urge you to read\ncarefully and in their entirety.

In the event that the date of the 2022\nAnnual Meeting is changed by more than 30 days\nfrom the anniversary date of GreenSky\u0092s 2021\nannual meeting of stockholders, such\nnotice must be received not earlier than 120\ndays prior to the 2022 Annual Meeting and not\nlater than 10 days following the date on which\npublic announcement of the date of the 2022\nAnnual Meeting is first made.\n\nA GreenSky stockholder\u0092s submission of a\nproposal or director nomination must include\ninformation specified in the GreenSky bylaws\nconcerning the proposal or nomination, as the\ncase may be, and certain information as to the\nstockholder\u0092s ownership of GreenSky common\nstock.

In connection\nwith this opinion, we have reviewed and\nconsidered, among other things: (i) a draft of\nthe Agreement, dated September 14, 2021; (ii)\ncertain publicly available financial\nstatements and other historical financial\ninformation of the Company that we deemed\nrelevant; (iii) certain publicly available\nfinancial statements and other historical\nfinancial information of Parent that we deemed\nrelevant; (iv) certain internal financial\nprojections for the Company for the years\nending December 31, 2021 through December 31,\n2023, as provided by the senior management of\nthe Company, as well as certain long-term\nannual growth rates for the Company for the\nyears ending December 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2025 based on guidance from senior\nmanagement of the Company; (v) publicly\navailable mean analyst net income, earnings\nper share and dividends per share estimates\nfor Parent for the years ending December 31,\n2021 through December 31, 2023; (vi) the\npublicly reported historical price and trading\nactivity for Company Class A Common Stock and\nParent Common Stock, including a comparison of\ncertain stock trading information for Company\nClass A Common Stock and Parent Common Stock\nand certain stock indices, as well as similar\npublicly available information for certain\nother companies, the securities of which are\npublicly traded; (vii) a comparison of certain\nfinancial and market information for the\nCompany and Parent with similar digital\nlending companies and financial institutions,\nrespectively, for which information is\npublicly available; (viii) the financial terms\nof certain recent business combinations in the\ndigital and consumer lending, mortgage and\npayments industry (on a nationwide basis), to\nthe extent publicly available; (ix) the\ncurrent market environment generally and the\nbanking, consumer lending and specialty\nfinance environment in particular; and (x)\nsuch other information, financial studies,\nanalyses and investigations and financial,\neconomic and market criteria as we considered\nrelevant. We also discussed with the Special\nCommittee of the Board of Directors and\ncertain members of the senior management of\nthe Company and its representatives the\nbusiness, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects of the\n\nCompany and participated in similar\ndiscussions with certain members of the senior\nmanagement of Parent and its representatives\nregarding the business, financial condition,\nresults of operations\nand prospects of Parent.\n\nIn performing our review, we have relied upon\nthe accuracy and completeness of all of the\nfinancial and other\ninformation that was available to us from\npublic sources, that was provided to or\ndiscussed with us by the Company, Parent or\ntheir respective representatives, or that was\notherwise reviewed by us and we have assumed\nsuch accuracy and completeness\nfor purposes of rendering this opinion without\nany independent verification or investigation.\nWe have further relied on the assurances of\nthe senior management of the Company that they\nare not aware of any facts or circumstances\nthat would make any\nof such information inaccurate or misleading\nin any respect material to our analyses.

We\nalso received a retainer fee, which retainer\nfee will be credited in full towards the\nadvisory fee which will become payable to\nPiper Sandler upon consummation of the Merger.\nWe will also receive a fee for rendering this\nopinion. The Special Committee of the Board of\nDirectors has also agreed to cause the Company\nto indemnify us against certain claims and\nliabilities arising out of our engagement and\nto reimburse us for certain of our out-of-\npocket expenses incurred in connection with\nour engagement. Piper Sandler was not engaged\nto provide any other investment banking\nservices to the Company in the two years\npreceding the date hereof, nor did Piper\nSandler provide any investment banking\nservices to Parent in the two years preceding\nthe date hereof. In the ordinary course of our\nbusiness as a broker-dealer, we may purchase\nsecurities from and sell securities to the\nCompany, Parent and their respective\naffiliates. We may also actively trade the\nequity and debt securities of the Company and\nParent for our own account and for the\naccounts of our customers.
