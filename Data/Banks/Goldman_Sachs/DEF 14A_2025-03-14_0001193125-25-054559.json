Enclosed you will find a    \nnotice setting forth the items we expect to   \naddress during the meeting, a letter from our \nLead Director, our Proxy Statement, a form of \nproxy and a copy of our 2024 Annual Report to \nShareholders. Your vote is important to us.   \nEven if you do not plan to attend the meeting,\nwe hope your votes will be represented.       \nGoldman Sachs generated strong earnings in    \n2024 against a backdrop of a resilient U.S.   \neconomy and accelerating capital markets      \nactivity. As we discuss in the 2024 letter to \nshareholders in our Annual Report, we saw the \nbenefits of our continued investment in our   \nfranchise and our people, which helped us     \nserve our clients with excellence and deliver \nstrong results for shareholders. We increased \nour net revenues by 16% year-over-year to     \n$53.5 billion; we grew our EPS by 77% to      \n$40.54; and we improved our ROE by over 500   \nbasis points to 12.7%. Now we are focused on  \nsetting up the firm for continued growth in   \n2025 and beyond, as we work to further        \nstrengthen our client franchise in Global     \nBanking & Markets, grow our more durable      \nrevenues in Asset & Wealth Management by      \ninvesting in our global public and private    \nasset management platform, and put the firm on\nthe path to generating mid-teens returns      \nthrough the cycle. We look forward to engaging\nwith our shareholders at our Annual Meeting. I\nwould like to personally thank you for your   \ncontinued support of Goldman Sachs as we      \ncontinue to invest together in the future of  \nour firm.

It  \nwas an honor to assume the critical           \nresponsibilities of Lead Director and         \nGovernance Committee Chair in April 2024 upon \nthe retirement of Adebayo Ogunlesi. When I did\nso, I committed to you that I would diligently\nuphold the various best practices of          \nindependent leadership on our Board, and it is\nwith this in mind that I want to share with   \nyou some of the highlights of the work of our \nBoard and Committees over the past year. Our  \nentire Board is deeply committed to overseeing\nthe success of the firm as we continue to     \ndrive long-term success and value creation for\nyou, our shareholders, as well as our broader \nstakeholders.                                 \n                                              \n          2024                                \n          Share\u2026                              \n          Value                               \n          Creat\u2026                              \n  +48%            +52%     +9%        +7%     \n  Stock                    Quarte\u2026    BVPS    \n  Price           TSR      Divide\u2026    Growth  \n                           Growth             \n          Share\u2026                              \n          Value                               \n          Creat\u2026                              \n          Over                                \n          Last 5                              \n          Years\u2026                              \n  +149%           +182%    +140%      +54%    \n  Stock                    Quarte\u2026    BVPS    \n  Price           TSR      Divide\u2026    Growth  \n                           Growth             \n                                              \nOver the past year, I have had the opportunity\nto engage with many representatives of our    \nshareholder base. Topics that were top of mind\nfor you in these meetings included the macro  \nenvironment, the dynamic geopolitical         \nlandscape, management\u2019s execution of the      \nfirm\u2019s strategy and the firm\u2019s 2024           \nperformance. These were all top of mind for   \nthe Board as well this past year, and we are  \npleased with the firm\u2019s strong 2024 results. I\nalso heard directly from you that the firm\u2019s  \ntalent was of the utmost importance.          \nAttracting and retaining the best talent is   \ncritical to the firm\u2019s success, and, as such, \nis continually an area of focus for our Board.\nGoldman Sachs has always been a firm from     \nwhich peer banks and other companies both     \ninside and outside the financial sector have  \nlooked to as a source of talent. Throughout   \n2024, the Board and the Compensation Committee\nevaluated the unique competitive threats for  \ntalent that Goldman Sachs faces, including    \nfrom alternative asset management firms, hedge\nfunds and others beyond the traditional       \nbanking sector. As the competitive landscape  \nintensified \u2013 and we observed demands for our \ntalent at all levels and across both revenue- \nand non-revenue-generating positions \u2013 we     \nfocused on the tools available to us to retain\nour top talent. One of the most important     \nroles we as independent directors play as     \nstewards of shareholder interests is in       \nexecutive succession planning. Late last year,\nwe were faced with a key decision with respect\nto the firm\u2019s longer-term succession plan and,\nmore immediately, what management team the    \nBoard wanted to drive forward the firm\u2019s      \nstrategy. This was a topic on which the entire\nBoard \u2013 not just the Compensation Committee \u2013 \nengaged heavily, and we announced in January  \nthat we had determined to grant five-year

Tom Montag          \nseamlessly assumed the role of Chair of our   \nRisk Committee in April 2024, drawing upon his\nextensive financial services experience and   \ndeep risk acumen. In June 2024, the Risk      \nCommittee also determined to form a Technology\nRisk Subcommittee, which we refer to as the   \nTRiS, to enhance our oversight of technology- \nrelated risk matters. The TRiS is expertly    \nchaired by Vice Admiral Jan Tighe, with       \nmembers Kevin Johnson, Peter Oppenheimer and  \nTom (ex-officioas Chair of the Risk           \nCommittee).

Our Board has\nestablished a Director Independence Policy    \nthat provides standards to assist our Board in\ndetermining which relationships and           \ntransactions might constitute a material      \nrelationship that would cause a director not  \nto be independent. To assess independence, our\nGovernance Committee and our Board review     \ndetailed information regarding our independent\ndirectors or nominees, including employment   \nand public company and not-for-               \nprofitdirectorships, as well as information   \nregarding immediate family members and        \naffiliated entities. Through the course of    \nthis review, our Governance Committee and our \nBoard consider relationships between the      \nindependent directors or nominees (and their  \nimmediate family members and affiliated       \nentities) on the one hand, and Goldman Sachs  \nand its affiliates on the other, in accordance\nwith our Director Independence Policy. This   \nincludes a review of revenues to the firm     \nfrom, and payments or donations made by the   \nfirm to, relevant entities affiliated with our\ndirectors or nominees (or their immediate     \nfamily members) as a result of ordinary course\ntransactions or contributions to not-for-     \nprofitorganizations. The Governance Committee \nand the Board also consider the heightened    \nindependence standards under SEC and NYSE     \nrules. For more information on the categories \nof transactions that our Governance Committee \nand our Board reviewed, considered and        \ndetermined to be immaterial under our Director\nIndependence Policy, see Annex B: Additional  \nDetails on Director Independence.

Conducting regular assessments,     \nrather than having a fixed policy, allows our \nBoard to deliberate the merits of our Board\u2019s \nleadership structure to ensure that the most  \nefficient and appropriate leadership structure\nis in place for our firm\u2019s needs, which may   \nevolve over time. We are committed to         \nindependent leadership on our Board.

The review takes into   \naccount a variety of factors, including our   \ngovernance practices, board evaluation and    \nongoing director feedback, and shareholder    \nfeedback on our Board and its leadership      \nstructure. As a result of this review, our    \nGovernance Committee determined that          \ncontinuing to have Mr. Solomon serve as both  \nChairman and CEO\u2014working together with a      \nstrong independent Lead Director\u2014is the most  \neffective leadership structure for our Board  \nand our firm at this time. Ultimately, we     \nbelieve that our current leadership structure,\ntogether with strong governance practices,    \ncreates a productive relationship between our \nBoard and management, including strong        \nindependent oversight that benefits our       \nshareholders. We will continue to conduct     \nBoard leadership assessments annually. If at  \nany time our Governance Committee determines  \nit would be appropriate to appoint an         \nindependent Chair, it will not hesitate to do \nso.

Shareholders      \nwishing to submit potential director          \ncandidates for consideration by our Governance\nCommittee should follow the instructions in   \nFrequently Asked Questions.                   \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              25  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\u2014STRUCTURE OF OUR BOARD   \nAND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES DIRECTOR EDUCATION   \n                      \n  Director Education  \n                      \nDirector education about our firm and our     \nindustry is an ongoing process that begins    \nwhen a director joins our Board. Upon joining \nour Board, new independent directors are      \nprovided with a comprehensive orientation     \nabout our firm, including our business,       \nstrategy and governance. For example, new     \ndirectors typically meet with senior leaders  \ncovering each of our revenue-producing        \nsegments and regions, as well as with senior  \nleaders from key control, finance and         \noperating functions. New directors also       \nparticipate in orientation sessions covering  \nthe responsibilities and key areas of focus of\nthe Board and its Committees. Orientation     \nprograms typically include more than 25 hours \nof programming and are tailored accordingly   \nfor each director, including based on         \nCommittee assignments. Additional training may\nalso be provided when a director assumes a    \nleadership role, such as becoming Lead        \nDirector or a Committee Chair, as appropriate.\nBoard and Committee presentations,            \nroundtables, regular communications and firm  \nand other industry events help keep directors \nappropriately apprised of key developments in \nour businesses and in our industry, including \nmaterial changes in regulation, so that they  \ncan carry out their oversight responsibilities\neffectively.                                  \n                           \n  Commitment of our Board  \n                           \nCommitment of our Directors\u20142024 Meetings Our \nBoard and its Committees met frequently in    \n2024.                                         \n                                              \n                            2024              \n                        Meetings              \n  Board                    28(a)              \n                                    86 \u2002\u2006\u00a0    \n                                    Total\u00a0    \n                                    Board\u00a0    \n  Audit                       16    and\u2003      \n                                    Committ\u2026  \n                                    Meetings  \n                                    in 2024   \n  Compens\u2026                    11              \n  Governa\u2026                     9              \n  Public                       6              \n  Respons\u2026                                    \n  Risk                        13              \n  NEW.                                        \n  Technol\u2026                                    \n  Risk                                        \n  Subcomm\u2026                     3              \n  (formed                                     \n  June                                        \n  2024)                                       \n  Executi\u2026                                    \n  Sessions                                    \n  of                                          \n  Indepen\u2026                     7              \n  Directo\u2026                                    \n  without                                     \n  Managem\u2026                                    \n  Additio\u2026                                    \n  Sessions                                    \n  of                                          \n  Indepen\u2026                    12              \n  Directo\u2026                                    \n  without                                     \n  Managem\u2026                                    \n            (a)\u200a                              \n            Includes                          \n            meetings                          \n            of                                \n            special                           \n            Board                             \n            committe\u2026                         \n            formed                            \n            from time                         \n            to time.                          \n            (b)\u200a                              \n            Chaired                           \n            by our                            \n            Lead                              \n            Director.                         \n            (c)\u2009Led                           \n            by our                            \n            other                             \n            independ\u2026                         \n            Committee                         \n            Chairs.                           \n                                              \nEach of our current directors attended over   \n75% (the threshold for disclosure under SEC   \nrules) of the meetings of our Board and the   \nCommittees on which they served as a regular  \nmember during 2024.

This includes   \nnot only financial performance, but how these \nresults are achieved, including how our most  \nsenior leaders are investing in the future of \nour firm and demonstrating an appropriate     \ncommitment to a strong control environment and\neffective financial and nonfinancial risk     \nmanagement practices.                         \n                                              \n       During 2019, we developed our initial  \n       Assessment Framework to provide        \n       greater definition to and              \n       transparency regarding the key         \n  \u220e    factors considered by the              \n       Compensation Committee to assess the   \n       firm\u2019s performance in connection with  \n       compensation decisions for our NEOs    \n       and our Management Committee.          \n                                              \n                                              \n       The Assessment Framework includes      \n       pre-established financial metrics and  \n       nonfinancial factors on a firmwide     \n       basis. It also includes information    \n  \u00bb    and metrics on business performance    \n       in the context of our strategic        \n       priorities that underpin firmwide      \n       performance and serve to inform        \n       compensation decisions for business    \n       leaders.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       The Assessment Framework aligns        \n       performance metrics and goals across   \n       our most senior leaders and provides   \n       a structure to help ensure that our    \n       compensation program for our NEOs and  \n       Management Committee continues to be   \n  \u00bb    appropriately aligned with our         \n       long-term strategy, our financial      \n       targets and stakeholder expectations   \n       as well as promotes the strength of    \n       our risk management and control        \n       environment and the safety and         \n       soundness of our firm.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       The Assessment Framework is reviewed   \n       annually, with metrics and factors     \n       updated as needed. For example, in     \n       2023, the Compensation Committee,      \n       taking into account Board and          \n       stakeholder feedback, adopted changes  \n       to enhance the types of metrics and    \n       the nature of information provided to  \n       the Committee in connection with the   \n  \u220e    risk management and controls pillar    \n       of the Assessment Framework. For       \n       2024, the Compensation Committee       \n       refined how it considered the          \n       Assessment Framework in the context    \n       of our announced strategic priorities  \n       and execution focus areas as well as   \n       further refined the metrics and        \n       information provided with respect to   \n       the risk management and controls       \n       pillar.                                \n                                              \nFor 2024, the assessment of firmwide          \nperformance to inform compensation decisions  \nfor our NEOs

NEO\u2019s individual           \nperformance and achievements is critical to   \nour Compensation Committee\u2019s decision-making  \nprocess, including how each of our NEOs helped\nto contribute to firmwide performance based on\nthe metrics and other criteria set forth in   \nthe Assessment Framework and other factors, in\neach case as applicable depending on the NEO\u2019s\nrole. Individual performance is also evaluated\nthrough the firm\u2019s feedback processes, which  \nare designed to solicit and provide individual\nperformance feedback, including on strengths  \nand development opportunities. These processes\ninclude input from employees, including those \nwho are senior to, peers of and junior to the \nemployee being reviewed, as applicable.       \nIndividual performance is assessed across a   \nvariety of factors, including the firm\u2019s Core \nValues of partnership, client service,        \nintegrity and excellence as well as risk      \nmanagement and manager effectiveness.         \n                                              \n       Our CEO: Under the direction of our    \n       Lead Director, our Governance          \n       Committee evaluated the performance    \n       of Mr.\u00a0Solomon (see Corporate          \n       Governance\u2014Board Oversight of our      \n       Firm\u2014Key Areas of Board Oversight\u2014CEO  \n  \u220e    Performance).

The Compensation   \n       Committee considered these individual  \n       performance evaluations, as well as    \n  \u220e    metrics and other criteria set forth   \n       in the Assessment Framework, in        \n       connection with their discussions to   \n       determine NEO compensation. In this    \n       context, Messrs. Solomon and Waldron   \n       submitted variable compensation        \n       recommendations to the Compensation    \n       Committee for our NEOs, but did not    \n       make recommendations about their own   \n       compensation.                          \n                                              \nMarket for Talent Our Compensation Committee  \nbroadly considers the competitive market for  \ntalent as part of its review of our           \ncompensation program\u2019s effectiveness in       \nattracting and retaining talent, including to \nhelp determine NEO compensation. It is        \ncritical for Goldman Sachs to remain          \ncompetitive by ensuring that longer-term      \ncompensation opportunities remain aspirational\nfor our senior talent in the context of an    \nincreasingly diverse competitive landscape.   \n                                              \n       Wherever possible, our goal is to be   \n       in a position to appoint people from   \n       within the firm to our most senior     \n  \u220e    leadership roles. Our executive        \n       compensation program is intended to    \n       incentivize our people to stay at      \n       Goldman Sachs and to aspire to these   \n       senior roles.                          \n                                              \nTo this end, the Committee regularly evaluates\nour NEO compensation program using            \nbenchmarking to help ensure that our senior   \nroles are properly valued, taking into account\ncompensation program design and structure, as \nwell as multi-year financial performance and  \nquantum of NEO pay.                           \n                                              \n       The Committee performs this            \n       evaluation with information and        \n       assistance from Human Capital          \n  \u220e    Management and the Committee\u2019s         \n       independent compensation consultant,   \n       Frederic W.

Consistent with our Compensation        \nPrinciples, employees at certain compensation \nthresholds receive a portion of their         \ncompensation in the form of equity-based      \nawards, which increases as compensation       \nincreases, in order to help support employee  \nshare ownership and align employee interests  \nwith those of long-term shareholders.         \nStakeholder Feedback Engagement has been and  \ncontinues to be a priority for our Board and  \nmanagement.

Similar to how other       \ncompanies in the alternative asset management \nindustry compensate their employees, a portion\nof compensation for our employees who support \nthis business is in the form of carried       \ninterest to directly tie their incentives to  \nthe performance of the funds they manage. The \nCarried Interest Program expands upon this    \nlong-standing and well-established construct  \nas a new element of our annual executive      \ncompensation structure to directly tie a      \nportion of annual compensation for our most   \nsenior leaders to a key growth strategy \u2013     \ngrowing the third-party alternatives business \nas part of our broader strategy to drive scale\nin our funds and further grow more durable,   \nfee-basedrevenues \u2013 in a manner that is       \naligned to long-term shareholder interests.   \nThe Carried Interest Program is designed to   \nenhance the firm\u2019s ability to attract and     \nretain talent. The Compensation Committee and \nthe Board considered the unique competitive   \nthreats for talent that Goldman Sachs faces,  \nincluding from alternative asset managers and \nothers beyond the traditional banking sector. \nIt is critical for Goldman Sachs to remain    \ncompetitive by ensuring that longer-term      \ncompensation opportunities remain aspirational\nfor our senior talent in the context of an    \nincreasingly diverse competitive landscape.

The Committee also      \nreviewed information about our historical fund\nperformance.                                  \n                                             \n  Key Terms of the Carried Interest Program  \n                                             \n                                              \n                         Executive Officers   \n                         (including each of   \n                         our NEOs) \u00a0 The      \n                         program may also be  \n  Program                provided to certain  \n  Participation          other senior         \n                         leaders as may be    \n                         determined from      \n                         time to time by the  \n                         Compensation         \n                         Committee.           \n                         For 2024, the        \n                         Carried Interest     \n                         Program will         \n                         represent: \u00a0 \u220e\u2002\u2009\u200a    \n                         CEO: 25% of          \n                         non-equity deferral  \n                         (i.e., 7.5% of       \n                         annual variable      \n                         compensation) \u00a0 \u220e\u2002\u2009  \n                         COO, CFO: 20% of     \n                         non-equity deferral  \n                         (i.e., 8% of annual  \n                         variable             \n                         compensation) \u00a0 \u220e\u2002\u2009  \n                         Other NEOs: 10% of   \n                         non-equity deferral  \n                         (i.e., 4% of annual  \n                         variable             \n                         compensation) \u00a0 The  \n                         percentage of        \n                         annual variable      \n                         compensation         \n  Percentage of          allocated to the     \n  Annual Variable        CIP will be          \n  Compensation           reduced, including   \n                         to zero, for each    \n                         participant in a     \n                         year where           \n                         insufficient carry   \n                         points are           \n                         available. \u00a0 In      \n                         addition, when       \n                         making compensation  \n                         determinations for   \n                         a given year, the    \n                         Compensation         \n                         Committee may        \n                         determine to adjust  \n                         for such year the    \n                         percentage of        \n                         annual variable      \n                         compensation to be   \n                         allocated to the     \n                         Carried Interest     \n                         Program as it deems  \n                         necessary,           \n                         desirable or         \n                         appropriate.         \n                         Allocation of carry  \n                         points is based on   \n                         a third party        \n                         valuation of the     \n                         present value of     \n                         the estimated        \n                         future carried       \n  Conversion             interest             \n  Mechanism              distributions from   \n                         the underlying       \n                         funds.

For 2024, these           \nindividuals each received a matching          \ncontribution of $12,500.

While our            \nCompensation Committee was provided with the  \nestimated value of these items, it determined,\nas in prior years, not to give these amounts  \nsignificant consideration in determining our  \nNEOs\u2019 2024 variable compensation. During 2024,\nwe made available to each of our Executive    \nLeadership Team a car and driver and, in some \ncases, other services, including for security.\nWe also offered our NEOs benefits and tax     \ncounseling services, generally provided or    \narranged by our subsidiary, The Ayco Company, \nL.P.

Our NEOs participate in our         \nexecutive medical and dental program and      \nreceive executive life insurance while they   \nremain PMDs. Our NEOs also receive long-term  \ndisability insurance coverage. Our NEOs (and  \ntheir covered dependents) are also eligible   \nfor a retiree healthcare program and receive  \ncertain other perquisites, some of which have \nno incremental cost to us. Section 162(m)     \nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue (Code) \nlimits the tax deductibility of executive     \ncompensation paid to each of our \u201ccovered     \nemployees\u201d to $1 million. In setting 2024     \nexecutive compensation, our Compensation      \nCommittee considered the factors identified in\nmore detail in \u2014How our Compensation Committee\nMakes Decisionsand did not take this limit on \ndeductibility into account.                   \n            \n  GS Gives  \n            \nAs a key element of the firm\u2019s overall impact \ninvesting platform, we established our GS     \nGivesprogram to coordinate, facilitate and    \nencourage global philanthropyby our PMDs.     \nAccordingly, firm contributions supported a   \n$147 million 2024 GS Givesprogram.

For 2021,     \n       2022 and 2023 Year-End PSUs and the    \n       SVC Awards, the NEO would forfeit all  \n       of these awards if the NEO associates  \n       with a Covered Enterprise during the   \n       applicable performance period (which   \n       is 2022 through 2024, 2023 through     \n       2025 and 2024 through 2026 for         \n       Year-End PSUs, respectively; and       \n       October 2021 through October 2026 for  \n       SVC Awards). PSUs and SVC Awards, and  \n       in some cases Shares at Risk           \n       delivered in respect thereof,          \n       continue to be subject to forfeiture   \n       for Violations following vesting.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       In the event of an NEO\u2019s death, any    \n       unvested PSUs or SVC Awards will vest  \n       and transfer restrictions on the       \n       Shares at Risk delivered under PSUs    \n       or SVC Awards will be removed. The     \n       delivery and performance conditions    \n       of the PSUs and SVC Awards are not     \n       affected by the NEO\u2019s death. For       \n       information on the number of PSUs and  \n       vested RSUs held by the NEOs at        \n       year-end, see \u20142024 Outstanding        \n       Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End and   \n       \u20142024 Non-Qualified Deferred           \n       Compensation above. These amounts do   \n       not reflect, in the case of death,     \n       the payment of a death benefit under   \n  (f)  our executive life insurance plan,     \n       which provides each NEO with life      \n       insurance coverage through age 75 (a   \n       $4.5\u00a0million benefit). In the case of  \n       an NEO\u2019s disability, provided that     \n       the NEO does not become associated     \n       with a Covered Enterprise, unvested    \n       PSUs or SVC Awards will vest and       \n       continue to be eligible to be earned   \n       pursuant to their existing terms. If   \n       the NEO does become associated with a  \n       Covered Enterprise, the awards would   \n       be treated as set forth in footnote    \n       (e)\u00a0above for that situation. Amounts  \n       included for SVC Awards reflect level  \n       of achievement against absolute and    \n       relative thresholds, based on actual   \n       performance as of December 31, 2024.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       In the case of a termination in which  \n       an NEO resigns and accepts a position  \n       that is deemed Conflicted Employment   \n  (g)  (as defined below), our Compensation   \n       Committee may determine to amend the   \n       terms of any then-outstanding PSUs or  \n       SVC Awards held by the NEO.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       In the event of an NEO\u2019s termination   \n       for Good Reason (as defined below) or  \n       without Cause within 18 months of a    \n       Change in Control, for PSUs and SVC    \n       Awards, vesting is accelerated and     \n       any applicable transfer restrictions   \n       are also removed, but delivery and     \n       performance conditions do not change.  \n       For Shares at Risk delivered in        \n       respect of SVC Awards and PSUs,        \n       certain forfeiture provisions no       \n       longer apply. For SVC Awards, in the   \n       case of a change of control that       \n       results in a delisting, the Change in  \n       Control would be deemed to be the      \n       last day of the performance period.    \n       Amounts included for SVC Awards        \n       reflect level of achievement against   \n       absolute and relative thresholds,      \n       based on actual performance as of      \n  (h)  December\u00a031, 2024.                     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nRetiree Healthcare PMDs who are not terminated\nfor Cause are eligible for the firm\u2019s retiree \nmedical and dental coverage for themselves and\ntheir eligible dependents. The firm subsidizes\nthe full cost of individual premiums for PMDs \nwho were promoted or hired as PMDs before     \nJanuary 1, 2021, and retire with at least     \neight years of PMD service; premiums for their\neligible dependents are not firm subsidized.  \nCoverage for PMDs who were promoted or hired  \non or after January 1, 2021, or retire with   \nless than eight years of PMD service, is not  \nfirm subsidized and they pay 100% of the      \npremiums for themselves and their eligible    \ndependents. In the case of a termination for  \nCause, the present value of premiums for      \nretiree healthcare coverage would be $0 for   \neach of our NEOs. In the case of a termination\nof employment for any other reason, Ms.       \nRuemmler is eligible for retiree healthcare   \ncoverage at full cost to her with no firm     \nsubsidy; the present value of her firm        \nsubsidized premium is thus $0. Each of our    \nother NEOs is eligible for a firm subsidy of  \n100% of his individual premium for coverage;  \nthe present value of their firm subsidized    \npremiums are thus: Mr. Solomon - $324,031, Mr.\nWaldron - $448,739, Mr. Coleman - $512,826 and\nMr. Rogers - $250,497. The values provided    \nabove reflect the present value of the cost to\nus of the 100% individual subsidy starting in \n2025 and were determined using a December 31, \n2024 retirement date and the following        \nassumptions: a 5.76% discount rate; mortality \nestimates based on the Pri-2012white collar   \nfully generational mortality table, with      \nadjustments to reflect continued improvements \nin mortality based on Scale MP-2021;estimates \nof future increases in healthcare subsidy     \ncosts of 8.15% pre-65,8.55% post-65and then   \ngrading down gradually each year until        \nultimate rate of 4.50% for medical and        \npharmacy in 2033 and 4.00% each year for      \ndental; and assumptions for subsequent        \neligibility                                   \n                                              \n        Goldman Sachs\u2002|\u2002Proxy\u00a0Statement\u00a0for\u00a0  \n  64    the\u00a02025\u00a0Annual\u00a0Meeting\u00a0of\u00a0           \n        Shareholders                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u2014EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION   \nPOTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE \nIN CONTROL for alternative coverage, which    \nwould eliminate subsidies under our program   \n(PMDs who are eligible for firm subsidized    \ncoverage but have not retired are assumed to  \nhave only 60% of the cost of their individual \npremiums subsidized to reflect the firm       \nsubsidies forfeited by PMDs who elect         \nalternative coverage). If an NEO becomes      \nassociated with certain entities, including   \ncertain Covered Enterprises, the NEO will     \nforfeit some or all of their benefits and/or  \ncoverage under our retiree healthcare program.\nCarried Interest Program As of December 31,   \n2024, no awards were made or outstanding      \npursuant to the Carried Interest Program      \n(which was adopted in January 2025). Other    \nTerms As PMDs and members of the Management   \nCommittee, our NEOs are generally subject to a\npolicy of six months\u2019 notice of termination of\nemployment. We may require that an NEO be     \ninactive (i.e., on \u201cgarden leave\u201d) during the \nnotice period (or we may waive the            \nrequirement).

As detailed in our \u2014  \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis above,   \nthe Compensation Committee places substantial \nimportance on the assessment of firmwide      \nperformance when determining NEO compensation.\nTo this end, the Committee utilizes the       \nAssessment Framework to assess a variety of   \nfinancial and nonfinancial measures in        \napplying its informed judgment to evaluate and\nset annual pay amounts. See \u2014 Compensation    \nDiscussion and Analysis\u20142024 Annual           \nCompensation .                                \nWe believe that the structure of our equity-  \nbased awards provides an intrinsic link to the\nfirm\u2019s longer-term performance. Through the   \nuse of PSUs, the amounts ultimately realized  \nby our NEOs with respect to annual            \ncompensation are subject to ongoing           \nperformance metrics (absolute and relative    \nROE) and are further tied to the firm\u2019s       \nlonger-term performance through stock price   \n(settlement of PSUs and Shares at Risk        \ndelivered in respect thereof). Given the use  \nof ROE in our annual PSUs, ROE has been       \nincluded as our \u201ccompany-selected measure\u201d in \nthe table below.                              \nWhile the Committee takes into account each of\nthe measures in our Assessment Framework in a \nholistic manner to evaluate executive         \ncompensation in consideration of firm         \nperformance (without ascribing any specific   \nweight to any single factor or metric), the   \nbelow measures from the Assessment Framework  \nhave been selected as they represent those    \nfirmwide performance measures for which the   \nfirm currently has set forward financial      \ntargets.                                      \n                     \n  \u220eROE               \n  \u220eROTE              \n  \u220eEfficiency Ratio  \n                     \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              69  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u2014PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE   \nDISCLOSURE                                    \n                                              \nIn addition, other equity-based awards,       \nincluding the SVC Awards and Retention RSUs,  \nas well as the Carried Interest Program,      \nfurther tie recipients interests to the firm\u2019s\nlonger-term performance across a variety of   \nmetrics (e.g., absolute and relative TSR,     \nstock price, fund performance).               \n                                              \nThe amounts set forth below in the required   \ntable are calculated pursuant to SEC rules but\ndo not represent amounts that have been       \nactually earned or realized by our NEOs,      \nincluding in respect of PSUs and SVC Awards.  \nPerformance conditions for many of these      \nawards have either not yet been satisfied or  \napplicable performance information is not yet \navailable.

Fair value of the 2021 Year-End U.K.    \nPSUs as of December\u00a031, 2024 was determined by\nmultiplying approximately 92% of the target   \nnumber of PSUs by $572.62, the closing price  \nper share of Common Stock on the NYSE on      \nDecember\u00a031, 2024, and including an           \napproximately 6% liquidity discount to reflect\nboth the transfer restrictions on the Common  \nStock underlying these PSUs and the lack of   \ndividend equivalent rights. Fair value of the \nSVC Awards as of December 31, 2024 was        \ndetermined by multiplying approximately 111%  \nof the target number of SVC awards by $572.62,\nthe closing price per share of Common Stock on\nthe NYSE on December 31, 2024, and including  \nan approximately 6% liquidity discount to     \nreflect the transfer restrictions on the      \nCommon Stock underlying these awards.

Our    \nburn rate is further inflated because of our  \nstrong history of buying back shares, which   \nlowers our shares outstanding and consequently\nincreases the burn rate. However, our share   \nrepurchases help us to return capital to      \nshareholders and historically have been       \naccretive to EPS and ROE.

A Restricted        \n       Share, including a Share at Risk, is   \n       a share of Common Stock that is        \n       registered in the recipient\u2019s name,    \n       but that is subject to restrictions    \n       (including transfer restrictions),     \n  \u220e    forfeiture and/or vesting conditions,  \n       for a period of time as specified in   \n       the Award Agreement. The recipient of  \n       a Restricted Share has the rights of   \n       a shareholder, including voting and    \n       dividend rights, subject to any        \n       restrictions and conditions specified  \n       in the Award Agreement.                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Dividend Equivalent Rights. A          \n       Dividend Equivalent Right represents   \n       an unfunded and unsecured promise to   \n       pay to the recipient an amount equal   \n       to all or any portion of the regular   \n       cash dividends that would be paid on   \n       shares of Common Stock if those        \n       shares were owned by the recipient. A  \n  \u220e    Dividend Equivalent Right may be       \n       granted alone or in connection with    \n       another Award. Under the 2025 SIP, no  \n       payments will be made in respect of    \n       Dividend Equivalent Rights at a time   \n       when any applicable performance goals  \n       relating to the Dividend Equivalent    \n       Right or the related Award have not    \n       been satisfied.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Options and SARs. An option entitles   \n       the recipient to purchase a share of   \n       Common Stock at an exercise price      \n       specified in the Award Agreement       \n       (including through a cashless          \n       exercise). The 2025 SIP permits        \n       grants of options that qualify as      \n       \u201cincentive stock options\u201d under        \n       Section\u00a0422 of the Code (ISOs) and     \n       nonqualified stock options. A SAR may  \n       entitle the recipient to receive       \n       shares of Common Stock, cash or other  \n       property on the exercise date having   \n       a value equal to the excess of market  \n       value of the underlying Common Stock   \n  \u220e    over the exercise price specified in   \n       the Award Agreement. Options and SARs  \n       will become exercisable as and when    \n       specified in the Award Agreement but   \n       not later than 10 years after the      \n       date of grant. The 2025 SIP provides   \n       that we may not reset the exercise     \n       price for options and SARs and that    \n       we may not issue any options or SARs   \n       with an exercise price less than the   \n       lesser of the closing price and the    \n       average of the high and low sale       \n       prices of a share of Common Stock on   \n       the NYSE, each on the date of grant.   \n       Grants of options and SARs are         \n       subject to the individual limits       \n       described below.                       \n                                              \nEligibility.The 2025 SIP permits grants of    \nAwards to individuals in the following classes\nof persons: (i) any current or prospective    \ndirector of Goldman Sachs, (ii) any officer or\nemployee of Goldman Sachs, (iii) any          \nconsultant or other service provider to       \nGoldman Sachs, and (iv) any former director,  \nofficer or employee of, or consultant or other\nservice provider to, Goldman Sachs with       \nrespect to the year of their departure from,  \nor completion of service to, the firm. As of  \nDecember 31, 2024, Goldman Sachs had 11 non-  \nemployeedirectors, 8 executive officers,      \napproximately 46,500 employees and            \napproximately 1,600 consultants or other      \nservice providers to Goldman Sachs who are, in\neach case, eligible to participate in the 2025\nSIP. Term.The 2025 SIP will terminate at, and \nno more Awards will be permitted to be granted\nthereunder without further shareholder        \napproval on or after, the date of our annual  \nmeeting of shareholders that occurs in 2029.  \nThe termination of the 2025 SIP will not      \naffect previously granted Awards.             \nAdministration.The 2025 SIP generally will be \nadministered by our Compensation Committee    \n(and those to whom it delegates authority),   \nunless our Board determines otherwise. For    \npurposes of this summary, we refer to the     \ncommittee that administers the 2025 SIP, and  \nto any person or group to whom this committee \ndelegates authority, as the \u201cCommittee.\u201d The  \nCommittee is granted broad discretion to make \nawards under the 2025 SIP and to interpret and\nimplement the 2025 SIP. In exercising this    \nauthority, the Committee (and to the extent   \nexercised by the Board, the Board) will have  \nno liability for any action taken or omitted  \nto be taken in good faith, including decisions\nto make awards as part of our non-            \nemployeedirector compensation program. This   \nmeans that no person, including grantees and  \nGoldman Sachs shareholders, may hold the      \nmembers of the Committee (or its delegees or  \nthe Board) personally liable for their good   \nfaith actions or omissions taken under the    \n2025 SIP. Our Board, in its sole discretion,  \nalso may grant Awards or administer the 2025  \nSIP.                                          \n                                              \n        Goldman Sachs\u2002|\u2002Proxy\u00a0Statement\u00a0for\u00a0  \n  78    the\u00a02025\u00a0Annual\u00a0Meeting\u00a0of\u00a0           \n        Shareholders                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u2014ITEM 3. APPROVAL OF THE  \nGOLDMAN SACHS AMENDED AND RESTATED STOCK      \nINCENTIVE PLAN (2025) SUMMARY OF MATERIAL     \nTERMS OF THE 2025 SIP Shares Subject to the   \nPlan; Other Limitations of Awards .Up to      \napproximately 53 million shares of Common     \nStock may be delivered pursuant to Awards     \ngranted under the 2025 SIP, consisting of the \nshares that remain available for issuance     \nunder the 2021 SIP. These shares may be newly \nissued shares or treasury shares. Each Award  \nor share of Common Stock underlying an Award  \nwill count as one share of Common Stock for   \nthese purposes. If any Award granted under the\n2025 SIP or any Prior SIP is forfeited,       \notherwise terminated or canceled without the  \ndelivery of shares of Common Stock, shares of \nCommon Stock are surrendered or withheld from \nany Award (including to satisfy federal,      \nstate, local or foreign taxes) or shares of   \nCommon Stock are tendered to pay the exercise \nprice of any Award granted under the 2025 SIP \nor any Prior SIP, then the shares covered by  \nsuch forfeited, terminated or canceled Award  \nor equal to the number of shares surrendered, \nwithheld or tendered will again become        \navailable to be delivered pursuant to Awards  \ngranted under the 2025 SIP. In the case of an \nacquisition, any shares of Common Stock that  \nwe deliver with respect to an Award that we   \nbecome obligated to make through the          \nassumption of, or in substitution for,        \noutstanding awards previously granted by an   \nacquired entity will not count against the    \nshares of Common Stock available to be        \ndelivered pursuant to Awards under the 2025   \nSIP. No more than 24 million shares of Common \nStock may be delivered under the 2025 SIP     \npursuant to the exercise of ISOs. In the event\nof any increase or decrease in the number of  \nissued shares of Common Stock (or issuance of \nshares of stock other than shares of Common   \nStock) resulting from certain corporate       \ntransactions that affect the capitalization of\nGoldman Sachs, the Committee will adjust the  \nnumber of shares of Common Stock issuable     \nunder the 2025 SIP and the terms of any       \noutstanding Awards in such manner as it deems \nappropriate to prevent the enlargement or     \ndilution of rights. As of February 24, 2025,  \nthe closing price of a share of Common Stock  \non the NYSE was $626.14. Fixed Amount of Non- \nEmployeeDirector Compensation.The 2025 SIP    \nmaintains the annual compensation limits for  \nservice on the Goldman Sachs Board for each   \nnon-employeedirector at an amount equal to    \n$450,000, in the case of a non-               \nemployeedirector who does not serve as a chair\nand $475,000, in the case of a non-           \nemployeedirector who serves as a chair, in    \neach case, inclusive of equity-based          \ncompensation and/or cash-basedcompensation, as\nmay be determined by the Board from time to   \ntime and/or elected by the director, as       \napplicable. For the avoidance of doubt, these \ndirector compensation limits represent the    \nprogram amount (which may be reduced) and     \nshall not prevent any grant of an RSU from    \nbeing rounded up to the nearest whole share.  \nIn addition, directors may be entitled to     \nadditional compensation for additional service\n(e.g., subsidiary board service). For         \nadditional detail on our non-employeedirector \ncompensation program, see \u2014Director           \nCompensation Program. Amendment.The Board may,\nat any time, suspend, discontinue, revise or  \namend the 2025 SIP in any respect whatsoever, \nincluding in any manner that adversely affects\nthe rights, duties or obligations of any      \nrecipients of Awards. In general, we will seek\nshareholder approval for any: (i) suspension, \ndiscontinuance, revision or amendment only to \nthe extent necessary to comply with any       \napplicable law, rule or regulation (including \nNYSE listing requirements), or (ii) amendment \nto increase the fixed amount of annual non-   \nemployeedirector compensation. Double-Trigger \nChange in Control.The Committee may include   \nprovisions in any Award Agreement relating to \na Change in Control, including the            \nacceleration of the vesting, delivery or      \nexercisability of, or the lapse of            \nrestrictions or deemed satisfaction of goals  \nwith respect to, any outstanding Awards. No   \nsuch acceleration, lapse or deemed            \nsatisfaction may occur with respect to a      \nChange in Control unless (in addition to any  \nother conditions set forth in the Award       \nAgreement):                                   \n                                          \n  \u220e    The Change in Control occurs; and  \n                                          \n                                              \n       The recipient\u2019s employment is          \n       terminated by the recipient for Good   \n       Reason, or by us, in either case       \n       under circumstances where an event     \n  \u220e    constituting Cause has not occurred    \n       and the recipient has not Failed to    \n       Consider Risk or Breached an           \n       Obligation to the Firm, within 18      \n       months following the Change in         \n       Control.                               \n                                              \nChange in Control, Cause and Good Reason are  \ndefined in the 2025 SIP and, unless the Award \nAgreement indicates otherwise, have the same  \nmeanings set forth above under \u2014 Executive    \nCompensation\u2014Potential Payments upon          \nTermination or Change in Control.             \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              79  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u2014ITEM 3. APPROVAL OF THE  \nGOLDMAN SACHS AMENDED AND RESTATED STOCK      \nINCENTIVE PLAN (2025) NEW PLAN BENEFITS No    \nHedging, Pledging or Transferring             \nAwards.Except as provided in the Award        \nAgreement, no Award (or any rights and        \nobligations thereunder) granted to any person \nunder the 2025 SIP may be sold, transferred,  \npledged, hedged or otherwise disposed of      \n(including through the use of any cash-settled\ninstrument) other than by will or by the laws \nof descent and distribution, and all Awards   \n(and any rights thereunder) shall be          \nexercisable during the life of the recipient  \nonly by the recipient or by the recipient\u2019s   \nlegal representative. The Committee may adopt \nprocedures pursuant to which some or all      \nrecipients of RSUs or Restricted Shares may   \ntransfer some or all of these Awards through a\ngift for no consideration to any immediate    \nfamily member or an estate planning vehicle in\nwhich the recipient and/or the recipient\u2019s    \nimmediate family members in the aggregate have\n100% (or such lesser amount as determined by  \nthe Committee from time to time) of the       \nbeneficial interest (as determined pursuant to\nsuch procedures), provided that the Award will\ncontinue to remain subject to the same terms  \nand conditions. In addition, the Committee may\nadopt procedures pursuant to which a recipient\nmay be permitted to bequeath some or all of   \nthe recipient\u2019s outstanding RSUs under the    \nrecipient\u2019s will to a charitable organization.\nRepayment.If the Committee determines that all\nterms and conditions of the 2025 SIP and the  \nAward Agreement in respect of an Award were   \nnot satisfied, then the recipient will be     \nobligated immediately upon our demand, as     \ndetermined by us in our sole discretion, (i)  \neither to (A) return to us the number of      \nshares of Common Stock received under the     \nAward or (B) pay us an amount equal to the    \nfair market value of such shares determined at\nthe time of delivery for RSUs or at vesting or\ntransferability for Restricted Shares, in each\ncase, without reduction for any shares of     \nCommon Stock or amount applied to satisfy     \nwithholding tax or other obligations in       \nrespect of such shares (other than the payment\nof an exercise price), and (ii) to repay to us\nproperty or cash received under any Dividend  \nEquivalent Rights. Right of Offset.We have the\nright to offset against our obligation to (i) \ndeliver shares of Common Stock (or other      \nproperty or cash), (ii) release restrictions  \nand/or other terms and conditions in respect  \nof Restricted Shares or (iii) pay dividends or\nmake payments under Dividend Equivalent       \nRights, in each case, under the 2025 SIP or   \nany Award Agreement, any outstanding amounts  \nthe recipient then owes to us and any amounts \nthe Committee otherwise deems appropriate     \npursuant to any tax equalization policy or    \nagreement. Our right to offset is subject to  \nthe constraints of Section 409A of the Code.  \nOther Terms of Awards.No recipient of any     \nAward under the 2025 SIP will have any of the \nrights of a shareholder of Goldman Sachs with \nrespect to shares subject to an Award until   \nthe delivery of the shares.

Recipients are advised  \nto consult with their own independent tax     \nadvisors with respect to the specific tax     \nconsequences that, in light of their          \nparticular circumstances, might arise in      \nconnection with their receipt of Awards under \nthe 2025 SIP, including any state, local or   \nforeign tax consequences and the effect, if   \nany, of gift, estate and inheritance taxes.   \nRSUs.A recipient of an RSU (whether time-     \nvested or subject to achievement of           \nperformance goals) will not be subject to     \nincome taxation at grant. Instead, the        \nrecipient will be subject to income tax at    \nordinary rates on the fair market value of the\nCommon Stock (or the amount of cash) received \non the date of delivery. The recipient will be\nsubject to FICA (Social Security and Medicare)\ntax at the time any portion of such Award is  \ndeemed vested for FICA purposes. The fair     \nmarket value of the Common Stock (if any)     \nreceived on the delivery date will be the     \nrecipient\u2019s tax basis for purposes of         \ndetermining any subsequent gain or loss from  \nthe sale of the Common Stock, and the         \nrecipient\u2019s holding period with respect to    \nsuch Common Stock will begin on the day after \nthe delivery date. Gain or loss resulting from\nany sale of Common Stock delivered to a       \nrecipient will be treated as long- or short-  \nterm capital gain or loss depending on the    \nholding period. Restricted Shares.A recipient \nof a Restricted Share will be subject to      \nincome tax at ordinary rates, as well as FICA \n(Social Security and Medicare) tax, on the    \nfair market value of the Common Stock (or the \namount of cash) on the vesting date, which is \nthe date upon which the applicable forfeiture \nconditions lapse (and may be the same as the  \ngrant date). The fair market value of the     \nCommon Stock (if any) on the vesting date will\nbe the recipient\u2019s tax basis for purposes of  \ndetermining any subsequent gain or loss from  \nthe sale of the Common Stock, and the         \nrecipient\u2019s holding period with respect to    \nsuch Common Stock will begin on the day after \nthe vesting date. Gain or loss resulting from \nany sale of Common Stock underlying an award  \nof Restricted Shares will be treated as long- \nor short-term capital gain or loss depending  \non the holding period. If permitted by the    \napplicable award agreement, pursuant to       \nSection 83(b) of the Code and the regulations \nthereunder and solely to the extent the       \nRestricted Shares are not considered vested   \nfor tax purposes on the grant date, a         \nrecipient may elect, within thirty days after \nthe date of the grant of the Restricted       \nShares, to recognize as of the grant date     \nordinary income equal to the fair market value\nof the shares of Common Stock awarded (less   \nany amount the recipient may have paid for the\nshares), determined on the date of grant      \n(without regard to the forfeiture conditions  \nand transfer restrictions). Such income will  \nbe subject to income tax withholding, as well \nas FICA (Social Security and Medicare) tax at \nthe time of making such election. If a        \nrecipient makes this election, the recipient\u2019s\nholding period will begin the day after the   \ndate of grant and no additional income will be\nrecognized by the recipient on the vesting    \ndate. However, if the recipient forfeits the  \nRestricted Shares before the lapse of the     \napplicable forfeiture conditions or transfer  \nrestrictions, no deduction or capital loss    \nwill be available except to the extent of any \namounts the recipient may have paid for the   \nshares (even though the recipient previously  \nrecognized income with respect to such        \nforfeited Restricted Shares). Nonqualified    \nOptions and SARs.The grant of a nonqualified  \noption (i.e., other than an ISO) or SAR will  \ncreate no tax consequences at the grant date  \nfor the recipient or Goldman Sachs. Upon      \nexercising such a nonqualified option or SAR, \nthe recipient will recognize ordinary income  \nequal to the excess of the fair market value  \nof the vested shares of Common Stock (and/or  \ncash or other property) acquired on the date  \nof exercise over the exercise price, and will \nbe subject to FICA tax in respect of such     \namounts. A recipient\u2019s disposition of Common  \nStock acquired upon the exercise of a         \nnonqualified option or SAR generally will     \nresult in long- or short-term capital gain or \nloss measured by the difference between the   \nsale price and the recipient\u2019s tax basis in   \nsuch shares (the tax basis in the acquired    \nshares of Common Stock generally being the    \nexercise price plus any amount recognized as  \nordinary income in connection with the        \nexercise of the option). Special Tax Treatment\nof ISOs.A recipient will not recognize taxable\nincome upon the grant or exercise of an ISO   \nexcept that the alternative minimum tax may   \napply upon exercise. Upon a disposition of    \nCommon Stock acquired upon exercise of an ISO \nbefore the end of the applicable ISO holding  \nperiods, the recipient generally will         \nrecognize ordinary income equal to the lesser \nof (i) the excess of the fair market value of \nthe Common Stock at the date of exercise of   \nthe ISO over the exercise price or (ii) the   \namount realized upon the disposition of the   \nISO Common Stock                              \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              81  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u2014ITEM 3.

Section 409A .Some Awards under the \n2025 SIP may be considered to be deferred     \ncompensation subject to special U.S. federal  \nincome tax rules (Section 409A of the Code).  \nFailure to satisfy the applicable requirements\nunder these provisions for Awards considered  \ndeferred compensation would result in the     \nacceleration of income and additional income  \ntax liability to the recipient, including     \ncertain penalties. The 2025 SIP and Awards    \nunder the 2025 SIP are intended to be designed\nand administered so that any Awards under the \n2025 SIP that are considered to be deferred   \ncompensation will not give rise to any        \nnegative tax consequences to the recipient    \nunder these provisions.                       \n                                              \n        Goldman Sachs\u2002|\u2002Proxy\u00a0Statement\u00a0for\u00a0  \n  82    the\u00a02025\u00a0Annual\u00a0Meeting\u00a0of\u00a0           \n        Shareholders                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nAUDIT MATTERS\u2014ITEM 4.

Harvard College, 1hundreds of higher       \neducation institutions have shuttered their   \ndiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs\nand positions. 2 Consequently, \u201cthere has been\na sharp uptick in litigation challenging      \ncorporate DEI programs and initiatives,       \nalleging that they require unlawful employment\nand contracting decisions to be made on the   \nbasis of race, in violation of Title VII of   \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2026\u201d 3 Corporate    \ncompliance lawyers now advise clients that    \n\u201cDEI initiatives and programs that are not    \nopen to all applicants or those that apply an \nexplicit race- or gender-based focus will     \nlikely face continued and heightened          \nscrutiny.\u201d Also: \u201cWe also expect to see       \nongoing scrutiny of perceived hiring quotas   \nand set asides, particularly those that may   \nappear to be incentivized by bonuses for      \nmanagement or company leadership.\u201d 4 Further, \n\u201ccompanies, and their management teams and    \nboards, should be prepared for increased      \nemployment-related litigation including       \nlitigation that seeks to hold executive       \nofficers and directors personally liable for  \npurported breaches of their fiduciary duties  \nin connection with the corporation\u2019s DEI      \npolicies.\u201d 5 Many corporations dramatically   \nreduced or eliminated their DEI programs, 6and\ncompanies face retribution for their          \ndiscrimination. For example, Starbucks was the\nsubject of a $28.3 million judgment after a   \nformer worker claimed she was fired for being \nwhite. 7 Supporting Statement:The Goldman     \nSachs Group Inc. (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d or          \n\u201cCompany\u201d) maintains it is \u201ccommitted to      \nmaking progress toward racial equity,         \nadvancing gender equality, and increasing     \nrepresentation at every level of our firm.\u201d   \nThe Company aims to achieve the following     \nhiring goals for analysts and associates \u2013    \nwomen (global): 50%; black (Americas): 11%;   \nHispanic/Latinx (Americas): 14%; and black    \n(UK): 9%. 8 Pay for the Company\u2019s executive   \nofficers include annual cash incentives       \nsubjectively awarded by the Compensation      \nCommittee based on its vague \u201cAssessment      \nFramework,\u201d which includes \u201cDiversity, Equity,\nand Inclusion (e.g., hiring and               \nrepresentation).\u201d 9Unfortunately, the Company \ndoes not disclose to what degree DEI hiring   \nand representation influences executive       \ncompensation. These discriminatory quotas     \nleave Goldman Sachs ripe for regulatory,      \nreputational and litigation risk. Its attempt \nto cram DEI\u2019s non-GAAPnature into the proxy   \nstatement\u2019s compensation discussion demands   \neither a legally dubious quota regime, or it  \nfails SEC compliance. 10The Council of        \nInstitutional Investors\u2019 general counsel      \nstated that research shows \u201ccompanies are     \nengaging in an opportunistic use of non-      \nGAAPearnings to justify higher executive pay.\u201d\nFTI Consulting advises there is a \u201cheightened \nfocus\u201d on \u201clitigation risk,\u201d which \u201chas       \ntransitioned from being merely an operational \nconcern to becoming a strategic priority for  \nthe highest levels of corporate governance.\u201d  \n11 Resolved:Shareholders request the Board of \nDirectors\u2019 Talent and Compensation Committee  \nto revisit its incentive guidelines for       \nexecutive pay, to identify and consider       \neliminating discriminatory DEI goals from     \ncompensation inducements.                     \n                                              \n  1  https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  2  https://www.chronicle.com/article/trac\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  https://www.wilmerhale.com/insights/cl\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://www.skadden.com/insights/publi\u2026  \n     opinion                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  5  https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2024/0\u2026  \n     affirmative-action-decision/             \n                                              \n                                              \n  6  https://nypost.com/2024/09/03/us-news/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  7  https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/17/busines\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  8  https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-commi\u2026  \n     report/multimedia/report.pdf             \n                                              \n                                              \n  9  https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  10  https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/c\u2026  \n      gaap-in-executive-pay/                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  11  https://www.fticonsulting.com/insight\u2026  \n      business-administration                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              87  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nITEMS 5-7.

Compensation    \n  for our                                     \n  senior management is based on many          \n  considerations,                             \n  but meeting numerical hiring or promotion   \n  goals is                                    \n  not one of them.

And this does not even   \ninclude non-employeesuits, such as from       \nvendors or clients negatively impacted by     \nGoldman\u2019s race-based policies. 14 Sensibly,   \nmany major companies have rolled back their   \nDEI commitments and are laying off DEI        \ndepartments. 15Alphabet and Meta cut DEI staff\nand DEI-relatedinvestments; 16Microsoft and   \nZoom laid off their entire DEI teams; 17Harley\nDavidson ceased its DEI efforts 18as did Jack \nDaniels. 19Since Muldrow,John Deere publicly  \nhalted DEI-relatedpolicies 20after Tractor    \nSupply explicitly stated that it \u201celiminate[d]\nDEI roles and retire[d] our current DEI       \ngoals.\u201d 21When Tractor Supply was the focus of\nRobby Starbuck\u2019s anti-DEIcampaign for three   \nweeks, which merely exposed the truth about   \nits DEI programs, they lost almost $3 billion \nin market cap. 22                             \n                                              \n  1  https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/\u2026  \n     harvard college/                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  2  https://ag.ks.gov/docs/default-source/\u2026  \n     letter.pdf                               \n                                              \n                                              \n     https://freebeacon.com/democrats/starb\u2026  \n  3  policies-he                              \n     blessed-got-the-coffee-maker-sued/       \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  5  https://www.skadden.com/insights/publi\u2026  \n     https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/04/17\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  6  https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  7  https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  8  https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  9  https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  10  https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  11  https://whyy.org/articles/starbucks-s\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n      See, e.g., cases set forth at           \n  12  https://aflegal.org/litigation/?datef\u2026  \n      .                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  13  https://www.reuters.com/business/fina\u2026  \n      08-30/                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  14  Cf.                                     \n      https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  15  https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/29/dei\u2026  \n      challenges/                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  16  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/22/googl\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  17  https://www.businessinsider.com/micro\u2026  \n      https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articl\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  18  https://x.com/harleydavidson/status/1\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  19  https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/jac\u2026  \n      sanity-back-business                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  20  https://x.com/JohnDeere/status/181331\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  21  https://corporate.tractorsupply.com/n\u2026  \n      Supply-Company-Statement/default.aspx   \n                                              \n                                              \n  22  https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/ne\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              89  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nITEMS 5-7.

The proponent \nhas advised us that a representative will     \npresent the proposal and related supporting   \nstatement at our Annual Meeting.              \n                         \n  Proponent\u2019s Statement  \n                         \nEnergy Supply Ratio Resolved:Shareholders     \nrequest The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.         \n(\u201cCompany\u201d) disclose annually its Energy      \nSupply Ratio (\u201cESR\u201d), defined as its total    \nfinancing through equity and debt             \nunderwriting, and project finance, in low-    \ncarbonenergy supply relative to that in       \nfossil-fuel energy supply. The disclosure,    \nprepared at reasonable expense and excluding  \nconfidential information, shall describe      \nCompany\u2019s methodology, including what it      \nclassifies as \u201clow carbon\u201d or \u201cfossil fuel.\u201d  \nCompany should include lending in its ESR if  \nmethodologically sound. Supporting Statement: \nAs a major global bank, Company is broadly    \nexposed to financial stability risks posed by \nclimate change and has made certain climate-  \nrelated commitments. Banks aligning their     \nactivities with their climate goals are better\nprepared to manage risk, including legal,     \nreputational and financial risks associated   \nwith climate change and capitalize on         \nopportunities associated with the global      \nenergy transition. According to the           \nInternational Energy Agency, reaching net zero\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2050 requires     \nrapid transition away from fossil fuels and   \ntripling in global annual clean energy        \ninvestment by 2030. 1The pace at which low-   \ncarbonenergy supply is scaled up will dictate \nthe rate at which fossil fuels are phased     \ndown. 2 Company is reportedly among the       \nlargest global financiers of fossil fuels;    \nhowever, it has committed to aligning its     \nfinancing activities with a net zero by 2050  \npathway and has made a 10-year$750 billion    \nfirmwide sustainable finance commitment by    \n2030. 3Although Company has robust commitments\nto sustainable finance, investors need further\ndisclosure to assess its clean energy         \nfinancing activity and relative financing of  \nfossil fuels. The ESR, a dollar-based metric, \nwill complement and supplement Company\u2019s      \nexisting emissions-based climate financial    \ndisclosures, including any disclosures under  \nEuropean Union reporting requirements, and    \nprovide decision-usefuldisclosure on Company\u2019s\nactivities and progress toward its public     \ncommitments.

The ESR has become a key climate  \ndisclosure metric. Bloomberg provides to its  \nclients ESRs for global banks, including      \nCompany, using a standardized methodology with\nclear definitions for \u2018low carbon\u2019 and \u2018fossil\nfuel,\u2019 however, it excludes lending. 5Three   \nleading North American Banks, Citi, JPMorgan  \nand Royal Bank of Canada committed to disclose\nan ESR, and their methodology, demonstrating  \nthat disclosure is feasible and leading market\npractice. Investors believe Company should    \nsimilarly disclose its annual ESR for which it\nis accountable, and work toward an industry-  \nstandard approach for calculating and         \nreporting it. Bloomberg published an          \nImplementation Guide 6and the Institute of    \nInternational Finance, a financial industry   \nassociation with around 400 members globally, \npublished a 2024 whitepaper that provides a   \npotential format for standardized disclosure  \nof methodological design choices. 7           \n                                              \n  1  https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-r\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n     Executive summary \u2013 Net Zero Roadmap: A  \n  2  Global Pathway to Keep the 1.5 \u00b0C Goal   \n     in Reach \u2013 Analysis - IEA                \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-commi\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/article\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n     https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/s\u2026  \n  5  2023.pdf;https://assets.bbhub.io/profe\u2026  \n     Financing-the-Transition_Energy-Supply\u2026  \n     Bank-Facilitated-Financing-Ratios.pdf    \n                                              \n                                              \n  6  https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/s\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  7  32370132_iif_white_paper_energy_supply\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              91  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nITEMS 5-7.SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS               \n                             \n  Directors\u2019 Recommendation  \n                             \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE       \nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. We value the\ntransparency on climate transition progress   \nthat our shareholders and other stakeholders  \nseek. Therefore, we publicly disclose         \nsignificant information related to our climate\nand other sustainability-related activities,  \nboth on a voluntary basis in our annual       \nfirmwide Sustainability Report and other      \nclimate-related disclosures, as well as       \npursuant to mandatory reporting regimes around\nthe world. We believe this suite of           \ndisclosures enables our shareholders to       \nadequately assess our progress toward our     \nclimate and other sustainability-related      \ntargets. As such, we do not believe that the  \npreparation of additional, bespoke disclosures\nthat lack reference to established            \nmethodologies would be a prudent use of firm  \nresources. Such disclosures would not provide \nmaterial new information, and, as such, we    \nbelieve that the adoption of this proposal is \nunnecessary and not in the best interests of  \nour firm or our shareholders.                 \n                                              \n       We have long acknowledged that the     \n       transition to a lower-carbon economy   \n       will be complex, take time, and        \n       require tradeoffs along the way. In    \n       addition, we must comply with          \n  \u220e    evolving, nuanced, and detailed        \n       regulatory-mandated reporting          \n       requirements across the world, as      \n       well as be cognizant of the            \n       continually shifting and diverging     \n       set of stakeholder expectations for    \n       voluntary reporting.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       We have devoted and will continue to   \n       devote significant resources to our    \n       climate- and sustainability-related    \n       disclosures, both at the firmwide and  \n       subsidiary level. This includes our    \n       voluntary reporting, such as our       \n  \u00bb    firmwide Sustainability Report, as     \n       well as mandatory reporting            \n       requirements, such as the E.U.\u2019s       \n       Non-Financial Reporting Directive,     \n       the Sustainable Finance Disclosure     \n       Regulation and the U.K.\u2019s FCA Rules    \n       on Climate-Related Disclosures, among  \n       others.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Given the developing regulatory        \n       reporting landscape, we must balance   \n       desires for new and/or bespoke         \n       disclosures against a variety of       \n       factors, including the availability    \n       of data, the existence of established  \n       or standardized methodologies to       \n  \u00bb    prepare such disclosures, whether      \n       similar disclosures are, or will be,   \n       available pursuant to existing or      \n       expected regulatory reporting, the     \n       administrative burdens in preparing    \n       new voluntary disclosures, and,        \n       importantly, whether such requests     \n       will provide material new information  \n       to our shareholders.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       We believe that development of the     \n       ratio requested by the proposal would  \n       not be a prudent use of resources for  \n       the firm, as it would be of limited    \n       long-term incremental value and is     \n  \u00bb    more likely to create confusion among  \n       our shareholders and other             \n       stakeholders given the lack of         \n       established methodologies and          \n       divergence from anticipated            \n       regulatory-required metrics.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Moreover, we have already set interim  \n       sectoral emissions intensity targets   \n       that cover relevant sectors,           \n       including Energy and Power, where the  \n       achievement of said targets is in      \n       large part predicated on increasing    \n       low-carbon technology financing on a   \n       relative basis in support of clients   \n  \u00bb    that are developing these projects     \n       and technologies. These portfolios     \n       cover the lending, underwriting and    \n       on-balance sheet investing we conduct  \n       in the sectors for which the           \n       proponent is seeking information,      \n       while also incorporating counterparty  \n       specific physical emissions rather     \n       than generically labeling certain      \n       technologies as low and high carbon.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Additional Context on Proposal         \n       Submission. The proponent also         \n       submitted a proposal requesting this   \n       new disclosure at our 2024 Annual      \n       Meeting, as it did at a number of our  \n       U.S. Peers. We engaged with the        \n       proponent on multiple occasions both   \n       before and after the 2024 Annual       \n       Meeting to discuss our concerns with   \n  \u220e    the specific request made in their     \n       proposal given the significant         \n       changes in the regulatory landscape    \n       regarding sustainability reporting as  \n       described above. Despite these         \n       conversations, the proponent           \n       submitted a nearly identical proposal  \n       to us for this 2025 Annual Meeting,    \n       without acknowledgement of these       \n       considerations.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n        Goldman Sachs\u2002|\u2002Proxy\u00a0Statement\u00a0for\u00a0  \n  92    the\u00a02025\u00a0Annual\u00a0Meeting\u00a0of\u00a0           \n        Shareholders                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS\nCertain Relationships and Related Transactions\nOn the recommendation of our independent      \ndirectors, our Board has in place various     \npolicies that provide guidelines for the      \nreview of certain relationships and           \ntransactions involving our directors and      \nexecutive officers. Related Person            \nTransactions Policy Our Board has a written   \nRelated Person Transactions Policy regarding  \nthe review and approval of transactions       \nbetween us and \u201crelated persons\u201d (directors,  \nexecutive officers, immediate family members  \nof a director or executive officer, or known  \n5% shareholders). Under this policy,          \ntransactions that exceed $120,000 in which a  \nrelated person has, may have or may be deemed \nto have a direct or indirect material interest\nare submitted to the Designated Reviewers (the\nChairs of the Governance, Audit and Risk      \nCommittees) or our full Governance Committee  \nfor review and approval, as applicable.       \nCertain transactions, including employment    \nrelationships, ordinary course banking,       \nbrokerage, investment, lending and other      \nservices, payment of certain regulatory filing\nfees and certain other ordinary course non-   \npreferentialtransactions, have been determined\nby the Governance Committee to be preapproved \ntransactions, and thus do not require specific\nreview and approval under the policy (although\nthese transactions must be reported to our    \nGovernance Committee and may still be         \nsubmitted for review and approval if deemed   \nappropriate). In reviewing and determining    \nwhether to approve a related person           \ntransaction, the following factors, among     \nothers, are considered:                       \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction is in the      \n  \u220e    interests of our firm and our          \n       shareholders;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction would impair   \n  \u220e    the independence of an independent     \n       director;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction presents a     \n       conflict of interest, taking into      \n       account the size of the transaction,   \n       the financial position of the          \n  \u220e    director or executive officer, the     \n       nature of the director\u2019s or executive  \n       officer\u2019s interest in the              \n       transaction, the ongoing nature of     \n       the transaction and any other          \n       relevant factors;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction is fair and    \n  \u220e    reasonable to us and on substantially  \n       the same terms as would apply to       \n       comparable third parties;              \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    The business reasons for the           \n       transaction;                           \n                                              \n                                     \n  \u220e    Any reputational issues; and  \n                                     \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction is material,   \n  \u220e    taking into account the significance   \n       of the transaction to our investors.   \n                                              \nAll of the transactions and relationships     \nreported under \u2014 Certain Relationships and    \nTransactionswere determined, under the        \nmechanisms of the Related Person Transactions \nPolicy, to be in the best interests of our    \nfirm and our shareholders. In addition to our \npolicies on director independence and related \nperson transactions, we also maintain a policy\nwith respect to outside director involvement  \nwith financial firms, such as private equity  \nfirms or hedge funds. Under this policy, in   \ndetermining whether to approve any current or \nproposed affiliation of a non-employeedirector\nwith a financial firm, our Board will         \nconsider, among other things, the legal,      \nreputational, operational and business issues \npresented, and the nature, feasibility and    \nscope of any restrictions, procedures or other\nsteps that would be necessary or appropriate  \nto ameliorate any perceived or potential      \nfuture conflicts or other issues.             \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              93  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS\nCertain Relationships and Transactions        \n                                  \n  Brokerage and Banking Services  \n                                  \nSome of our directors and executive officers  \n(and persons or entities affiliated with them)\nhave brokerage and/or discretionary accounts  \nat our broker-dealer affiliates and may       \nutilize other ordinary course banking or      \nlending products (including credit cards)     \noffered by Goldman Sachs Bank USA.

In  \n       the case of The 401(k) Savings Plan,   \n       a third-party investment manager who   \n       is not affiliated with GS is           \n       responsible for fund selection and     \n       selected the Vanguard mutual funds.    \n       We believe that the fees paid to The   \n       Vanguard Group through the Vanguard    \n       mutual funds are the same as the fees  \n       that are paid by the other holders of  \n       the same share classes of those        \n  (c)  funds.                                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n        Goldman Sachs\u2002|\u2002Proxy\u00a0Statement\u00a0for\u00a0  \n  98    the\u00a02025\u00a0Annual\u00a0Meeting\u00a0of\u00a0           \n        Shareholders                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION Additional Information \nHow to Contact Us Across our shareholder base \nthere is a wide variety of viewpoints about   \nmatters affecting our firm.

ROTE is calculated by   \ndividing net earnings applicable to common    \nshareholders by average monthly tangible      \ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity (tangible common  \nshareholders\u2019 equity is calculated as total   \nshareholders\u2019 equity less preferred stock,    \ngoodwill and identifiable intangible assets). \nManagement believes that ROTE is meaningful   \nbecause it measures the performance of        \nbusinesses consistently, whether they were    \nacquired or developed internally, and that    \ntangible common shareholders\u2019 equity is       \nmeaningful because it is a measure that the   \nfirm and investors use to assess capital      \nadequacy. ROTE and tangible common            \nshareholders\u2019 equity are non-GAAPmeasures and \nmay not be comparable to similar non-         \nGAAPmeasures used by other companies.

After any adjustment made pursuant to  \nthis Section 1.6.2, the number of Shares      \nsubject to each Outstanding Award shall be    \nrounded up or down to the nearest whole number\nas determined by the Committee. 1.6.3 Except  \nas provided in this Section 1.6 or under the  \nterms of any applicable Award Agreement, there\nshall be no limit on the number or the value  \nof Shares that may be subject to Awards to any\nindividual under the Plan. 1.6.4 There shall  \nbe no limit on the amount of cash, securities \n(other than Shares as provided in Section     \n1.6.1, as adjusted by Section 1.6.2) or other \nproperty that may be delivered pursuant to any\nAward. 1.7 Non-EmployeeDirector Compensation  \n1.7.1 For each calendar year of service on the\nBoard, each Non-EmployeeDirector may receive  \ntotal annual compensation in a fixed amount   \nequal to (a) in the case of a Non-            \nEmployeeDirector who does not serve as a chair\nof a committee appointed by the Board,        \n$450,000 and (b) in the case of a Non-        \nEmployeeDirector who serves as a chair of a   \ncommittee appointed by the Board, $475,000 (in\neach case, the \u201cFixed Amount\u201d). 1.7.2 The     \nFixed Amount may be payable in the form of    \ncash and/or an Award that shall have such     \nterms and conditions as the Board may from    \ntime to time specify. For the avoidance of    \ndoubt, to the extent the Fixed Amount or any  \nportion of it is payable in the form of an    \nAward, then nothing in this Section 1.7 shall \nprevent any Award from being rounded up to the\nnearest whole Share or its equivalent value.  \n1.7.3 The Board may at any time provide any   \nNon-EmployeeDirector with a retainer or other \nfee in addition to the Fixed Amount, including\nfor service on or chairing a special or newly \nformed committee or subcommittee, or for any  \nother service, in each case as determined in  \nthe discretion of the Board.
