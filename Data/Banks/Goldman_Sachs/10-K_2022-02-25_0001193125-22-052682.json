Business Continuity and Information \nSecurity Business continuity and information  \nsecurity, including cyber security, are high  \npriorities for us. Their importance has been  \nhighlighted by (i) the coronavirus            \n(COVID-19)pandemic and the work-from-home     \narrangements implemented by companies         \nworldwide in response, including us, (ii)     \nnumerous highly publicized events in recent   \nyears, including cyber attacks against        \nfinancial institutions, governmental agencies,\nlarge consumer-based companies, software and  \ninformation technology service providers and  \nother organizations, some of which have       \nresulted in the unauthorized access to or     \ndisclosure of personal information and other  \nsensitive or confidential information, the    \ntheft and destruction of corporate information\nand requests for ransom payments, and (iii)   \nextreme weather events.

The key elements\nof the program are crisis management, business\ncontinuity, technology resilience, business   \nrecovery, assurance and verification, and     \nprocess improvement. In the area of           \ninformation security, we have developed and   \nimplemented a framework of principles,        \npolicies and technology designed to protect   \nthe information provided to us by our clients \nand our own information from cyber attacks and\nother misappropriation, corruption or loss.   \nSafeguards are designed to maintain the       \nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of\ninformation.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTalent Development and Retention We seek to   \nhelp our people achieve their full potential  \nby investing in them and supporting a culture \nof continuous development. Our goals are to   \nmaximize individual capabilities, increase    \ncommercial effectiveness and innovation,      \nreinforce our culture, expand professional    \nopportunities, and help our people contribute \npositively to their communities. Instilling   \nour culture in all employees is a continuous  \nprocess, in which training plays an important \npart. We offer our employees the opportunity  \nto participate in ongoing educational         \nofferings and periodic seminars through       \nGoldman Sachs University. To accelerate their \nintegration into the firm and our culture, new\nhires have the opportunity to receive training\nbefore they start working and orientation     \nprograms with an emphasis on culture and      \nnetworking, and nearly all employees          \nparticipate in at least one training event    \neach year. For our more senior employees, we  \nprovide guidance and training on how to manage\npeople and projects effectively, exhibit      \nstrong leadership and exemplify our culture.  \nWe are also focused on developing a high      \nperforming, diverse leadership pipeline and   \ncareer planning for our next generation of    \nleaders. We maintain a variety of programs    \naimed at employees\u2019 professional growth and   \nsupport throughout their careers and as they  \nevolve into leaders, including initiatives,   \nsuch as our Vice President and Managing       \nDirector Leadership Acceleration Initiatives. \nEnhancing our people\u2019s experience of internal \nmobility is a key focus, as we believe that   \nthis will inspire employees, help retain top  \ntalent and create diverse experiences to build\nfuture leaders. Another important part of     \ninstilling our culture is our employee        \nperformance review process. Employees are     \nreviewed by supervisors, co-workersand        \nemployees whom they supervise in a            \n360-degreereview process that is integral to  \nour team approach and includes an evaluation  \nof an employee\u2019s performance with respect to  \nrisk management, protecting our reputation,   \nadherence to our code of conduct, compliance, \nand diversity and inclusion principles. Our   \napproach to evaluating employee performance   \ncenters on providing robust, timely and       \nactionable feedback that facilitates          \nprofessional development. We have directed our\nmanagers, as leaders at the firm, to take an  \nactive coaching role with their teams. We have\nalso implemented \u201cThe Three Conversations at  \nGS\u201d through which managers establish goals    \nwith their team members at the start of the   \nyear, check in mid-yearon progress and then   \nclose out the year with a conversation on     \nperformance against goals. We believe that our\npeople value opportunities to contribute to   \ntheir communities and that these opportunities\nenhance their job satisfaction. We also       \nbelieve that being able to volunteer together \nwith colleagues and participate in community  \norganizations working on local service        \nprojects strengthens our people\u2019s bond with   \nus. Community TeamWorks, our signature        \nvolunteering initiative, enables our people to\nparticipate in high-impact, team-based        \nvolunteer opportunities, including projects   \ncoordinated with hundreds of nonprofit partner\norganizations worldwide. During 2021, our     \npeople volunteered approximately 80,000 hours \nof service globally through Community         \nTeamWorks, with approximately 15,000 employees\npartnering with approximately 370 nonprofit   \norganizations on approximately 800 community  \nprojects. To respond to the interest of our   \npeople in helping with the response to the    \nCOVID-19pandemic, we have developed a series  \nof opportunities to support vulnerable        \npopulations remotely, including small business\nowners, students and the elderly. Wellness We \nrecognize that for our people to be successful\nin the workplace they need support in their   \npersonal, as well as their professional lives.\nWe have created a strong support framework for\nwellness, which is intended to enable         \nemployees to better balance their roles at    \nwork and their responsibilities at home. In   \naddition to providing 20 weeks of parental    \nleave for all employees, we provide other     \nbenefits to support the wellness of our       \nemployees, including family care leave,       \nbereavement leave and, for longer-tenured     \nemployees, an unpaid sabbatical leave. We also\ncontinue to advance our resilience programs,  \noffering our people a range of counseling,    \ncoaching, medical advisory and personal       \nwellness services. We have increased the      \navailability of these resources during the    \nCOVID-19pandemic, and we have continued to    \nevolve and strengthen virtual offerings with  \nthe aim of maintaining the physical and mental\nwell-being of our employees, enhancing their  \neffectiveness and cohesiveness and providing  \nthem with greater opportunities to access     \nsupport. We also introduced a COVID-19        \n10-dayfamily leave policy, available to our   \npeople globally to care for family members due\nto COVID-19related illness or meet childcare  \nneeds, including homeschooling. We remain     \nfocused on facilitating the safe return of our\nemployees to our offices, as circumstances    \npermit, and employees in a number of our      \nlocations around the world have returned to   \nthe office to varying degrees. Given that the \nsituation regarding the COVID-19pandemic      \nvaries geographically, our approach to        \ntransitioning back to the office is tailored  \nto each location, and it evolves based on the \nspecific conditions and requirements of each  \nlocation. We have comprehensive protocols in  \nplace, including regular testing, and we will \ncontinue to be guided by a people-first       \napproach as circumstances evolve.             \n                                     \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    7  \n                                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Global Reach and Strategic     \nLocations As a firm with a global client base,\nwe take a strategic approach to attracting,   \ndeveloping and managing a global workforce.   \nOur clients are located worldwide and we are  \nan active participant in financial markets    \naround the world. As of December 2021, we had \nheadcount of 43,900, offices in over 35       \ncountries and 52% of our headcount was based  \nin the Americas, 18% in EMEA and 30% in Asia. \nOur employees come from over 180 countries and\nspeak more than 110 languages as of December  \n2021. In addition to maintaining offices in   \nmajor financial centers around the world, we  \nhave established key strategic locations,     \nincluding in Bengaluru, Salt Lake City,       \nDallas, Singapore and Warsaw. We continue to  \nevaluate the expanded use of strategic        \nlocations, including cities in which we do not\ncurrently have a presence. As of December     \n2021, 40% of our employees were working in one\nof these key strategic locations. We believe  \nour investment in these strategic locations   \nenables us to build centers of excellence     \naround specific capabilities that support our \nbusiness initiatives. Sustainability We have a\nlong-standing commitment to sustainability.   \nOur two priorities in this area are helping   \nclients across industries facilitate and      \nthrive in a low-carboneconomy (Climate        \nTransition) and leveraging our capabilities to\nadvance economic empowerment (Inclusive       \nGrowth). We have established a Sustainable    \nFinance Group, which serves as the centralized\ngroup that drives climate strategy and        \nsustainability efforts across our firm,       \nincluding commercial efforts alongside our    \nbusinesses to advance Climate Transition and  \nInclusive Growth. In 2020, we created a new   \nrole, Global Head of Sustainability and       \nInclusive Growth, which, like our One Goldman \nSachsinitiative, is intended to facilitate the\napplication of our full capabilities across   \nboth Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. \nEach of our segments has launched a           \nSustainability Council. These councils focus  \non identifying key Environmental, Social and  \nGovernance (ESG) priorities for the segment,  \ndeveloping sustainability-related capabilities\nand delivering sustainability-focused         \nsolutions to clients in a holistic way. Our   \nactivities relating to sustainability present \nboth financial and nonfinancial risks, and we \nhave processes for managing these risks,      \nsimilar to the other risks we face. We have   \nintegrated oversight of climate-related risks \ninto our risk management governance structure,\nfrom senior management to our Board and its   \ncommittees, including the Risk and Public     \nResponsibilities Committees. The Risk         \nCommittee of the Board oversees firmwide      \nfinancial and nonfinancial risks, which       \ninclude climate risk, and, as part of its     \noversight, receives updates on our risk       \nmanagement approach to climate risk. The      \nPublic Responsibilities Committee of the Board\nassists the Board in its oversight of our     \nfirmwide sustainability strategy and          \nsustainability risks affecting us, including  \nwith respect to climate change. As part of its\noversight, the Public Responsibilities        \nCommittee receives periodic updates on our    \nsustainability strategy, and also periodically\nreviews our governance and related policies   \nand processes for sustainability and climate  \nchange-related risks. We have also implemented\nan Environmental Policy Framework to guide our\noverall approach to sustainability issues. We \napply this Framework when evaluating          \ntransactions for environmental and social     \nrisks and impacts. Our employees also receive \ntraining with respect to environmental and    \nsocial risks, including for sectors and       \nindustries that we believe have higher        \npotential for these risks.

In addition, we \nare working with various external groups to   \ndevelop methods, metrics and frameworks for   \nthe financial sector, with an aim to support  \ngreater consistency, comparability and utility\nin approaches to measuring the financial      \nsector\u2019s contribution to Climate Transition   \ninitiatives. We believe we can advance        \nsustainability by partnering with our clients \nacross our businesses, including by developing\nnew sustainability-linked financing solutions,\noffering strategic advice, or coinvesting     \nalongside our clients in clean energy         \ncompanies. We have announced a target to      \ndeploy $750 billion in sustainable financing, \ninvesting and advisory activity by the        \nbeginning of 2030. As of December 2021, we    \nachieved approximately 40% of that goal, with \nthe majority dedicated to Climate Transition. \nIn addition, we have announced our commitment \nto align our financing activities with a net- \nzero-by-2050pathway. In that context, we have \nset an initial set of targets for 2030 focused\non three sectors \u2014 power, oil and gas, and    \nauto manufacturing \u2014 where we believe we can  \nhave the most significant impact and we see an\nopportunity to proactively engage our clients,\ninvestors, advocacy groups and multi-         \nstakeholder organizations, deploy capital     \nrequired for transition, and invest in new    \ncommercial solutions to drive decarbonization \nin the real economy. Carbon neutrality is also\na priority for the operation of our firm and  \nour supply chain. In 2015, we achieved carbon \nneutrality in our operations and business     \ntravel, ahead of our 2020 goal announced in   \n2009. We have expanded our operational carbon \ncommitment to include our supply chain,       \ntargeting net-zerocarbon emissions by 2030. In\naddition to Climate Transition, our approach  \nto sustainability also centers on Inclusive   \nGrowth and advancing economic empowerment and \nfinancial opportunity for all. We have        \nsponsored initiatives, such as One Million    \nBlack Women, Launch With GS, our Urban        \nInvestment Group, 10,000 Women and 10,000     \nSmall Businesses. An overarching theme of our \nsustainability strategy is promoting diversity\nand inclusion as an imperative for us, as well\nas our clients and their boards. These efforts\nare further strengthened by strategic         \npartnerships that we have established in areas\nwhere we have identified gaps, or believe we  \nare able to drive even greater impact through \ncollaboration. We also believe our ability to \nachieve our sustainability objectives is      \ncritically dependent on the strengths and     \ntalents of our people, and we recognize that  \nour people are able to maximize their impact  \nby collaborating in a diverse and inclusive   \nwork environment. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Human       \nCapital Management\u201d for information about our \nhuman capital management goals, programs and  \npolicies. Competition The financial services  \nindustry and all of our businesses are        \nintensely competitive, and we expect them to  \nremain so. Our competitors are other entities \nthat provide investment banking (including    \ntransaction banking), market-making,          \ninvestment management services, commercial    \nand/or consumer lending, deposit-taking and   \nother banking products and services, as well  \nas those entities that make investments in    \nsecurities, commodities, derivatives, real    \nestate, loans and other financial assets.     \nThese entities include brokers and dealers,   \ninvestment banking firms, commercial banks,   \ncredit card issuers, insurance companies,     \ninvestment advisers, mutual funds, hedge      \nfunds, private equity funds, merchant banks,  \nconsumer finance companies and financial      \ntechnology and other internet-based companies.\nWe compete with some entities globally and    \nwith others on a regional, product or niche   \nbasis. We compete based on a number of        \nfactors, including transaction execution,     \nclient experience, products and services,     \ninnovation, reputation and price. We have     \nfaced, and expect to continue to face,        \npressure to retain market share by committing \ncapital to businesses or transactions on terms\nthat offer returns that may not be            \ncommensurate with their risks. In particular, \ncorporate clients seek such commitments (such \nas agreements to participate in their loan    \nfacilities) from financial services firms in  \nconnection with investment banking and other  \nassignments. Consolidation and convergence    \nhave significantly increased the capital base \nand geographic reach of some of our           \ncompetitors, and have also hastened the       \nglobalization of the securities and other     \nfinancial services markets. As a result, we   \nhave had to commit capital to support our     \ninternational operations and to execute large \nglobal transactions. To capitalize on some of \nour most significant opportunities, we will   \nhave to compete successfully with financial   \ninstitutions that are larger and have more    \ncapital and that may have a stronger local    \npresence and longer operating history outside \nthe U.S. We also compete with smaller         \ninstitutions that offer more targeted         \nservices, such as independent advisory firms. \nSome clients may perceive these firms to be   \nless susceptible to potential conflicts of    \ninterest than we are, and, as described below,\nour ability to effectively compete with them  \ncould be affected by regulations and          \nlimitations on activities that apply to us but\nmay not apply to them.                        \n                                     \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    9  \n                                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nA number of our businesses are subject to     \nintense price competition. Efforts by our     \ncompetitors to gain market share have resulted\nin pricing pressure in our investment banking,\nmarket-making, consumer, wealth management and\nasset management businesses. For example, the \nincreasing volume of trades executed          \nelectronically, through the internet and      \nthrough alternative trading systems, has      \nincreased the pressure on trading commissions,\nin that commissions for electronic trading are\ngenerally lower than those for non-           \nelectronictrading. It appears that this trend \ntoward low-commissiontrading will continue.   \nPrice competition has also led to compression \nin the difference between the price at which a\nmarket participant is willing to sell an      \ninstrument and the price at which another     \nmarket participant is willing to buy it (i.e.,\nbid/offer spread), which has affected our     \nmarket-making businesses. The increasing      \nprevalence of passive investment strategies   \nthat typically have lower fees than other     \nstrategies we offer has affected the          \ncompetitive and pricing dynamics for our asset\nmanagement products and services. In addition,\nwe believe that we will continue to experience\ncompetitive pressures in these and other areas\nin the future as some of our competitors seek \nto obtain market share by further reducing    \nprices, and as we enter into or expand our    \npresence in markets that may rely more heavily\non electronic trading and execution. We and   \nother banks also compete for deposits on the  \nbasis of the rates we offer. Increases in     \nshort-term interest rates are expected to     \nresult in more intense competition in deposit \npricing. We also compete on the basis of the  \ntypes of financial products and client        \nexperiences that we and our competitors offer.\nIn some circumstances, our competitors may    \noffer financial products that we do not offer \nand that our clients may prefer, or our       \ncompetitors may develop technology platforms  \nthat provide a better client experience. The  \nprovisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank\nAct), the requirements promulgated by the     \nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel \nCommittee) and other financial regulations    \ncould affect our competitive position to the  \nextent that limitations on activities,        \nincreased fees and compliance costs or other  \nregulatory requirements do not apply, or do   \nnot apply equally, to all of our competitors  \nor are not implemented uniformly across       \ndifferent jurisdictions. For example, the     \nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit\nproprietary trading and restrict investments  \nin certain hedge and private equity funds     \ndifferentiate between U.S.-based and          \nnon-U.S.-basedbanking organizations and give  \nnon-U.S.-basedbanking organizations greater   \nflexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and  \nto form and invest in funds outside the U.S.  \nLikewise, the obligations with respect to     \nderivative transactions under Title VII of the\nDodd-Frank Act depend, in part, on the        \nlocation of the counterparties to the         \ntransaction. The impact of regulatory         \ndevelopments on our competitive position has  \ndepended and will continue to depend to a     \nlarge extent on the manner in which the       \nrequired rulemaking and regulatory guidance   \nevolve, the extent of international           \nconvergence, and the development of market    \npractice and structures under the evolving    \nregulatory regimes, as described further in   \n\u201cRegulation\u201d below. We also face intense      \ncompetition in attracting and retaining       \nqualified employees. Our ability to continue  \nto compete effectively has depended and will  \ncontinue to depend upon our ability to attract\nnew employees, retain and motivate our        \nexisting employees and to continue to         \ncompensate employees competitively amid       \nintense public and regulatory scrutiny on the \ncompensation practices of large financial     \ninstitutions. Our pay practices and those of  \ncertain of our competitors are subject to     \nreview by, and the standards of, the FRB and  \nother regulators inside and outside the U.S., \nincluding the Prudential Regulation Authority \n(PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority     \n(FCA) in the U.K. We also compete for         \nemployees with institutions whose pay         \npractices are not subject to regulatory       \noversight. See \u201cRegulation \u2014 Compensation     \nPractices\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Competition \u2014  \nOur businesses may be adversely affected if we\nare unable to hire and retain qualified       \nemployees\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form    \n10-Kfor further information about such        \nregulation. Regulation As a participant in the\nglobal financial services industry, we are    \nsubject to extensive regulation and           \nsupervision worldwide. The regulatory regimes \napplicable to our operations worldwide have   \nbeen, and continue to be, subject to          \nsignificant changes. The Basel Committee is   \nthe primary global standard setter for        \nprudential bank regulation; however, its      \nstandards do not become effective in a        \njurisdiction until the relevant regulators    \nhave adopted rules to implement its standards.\nThe implications of these regulations for our \nbusinesses depend to a large extent on their  \nimplementation by the relevant regulators     \nglobally, and the market practices and        \nstructures that develop. New regulations have \nbeen adopted or are being considered by       \nregulators and policy makers worldwide, as    \ndescribed below. The effects of any changes to\nthe regulations affecting our businesses,     \nincluding as a result of the proposals        \ndescribed below, are uncertain and will not be\nknown until such changes are finalized and    \nmarket practices and structures develop under \nthe revised regulations.                      \n                                      \n  10    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur principal subsidiaries operating in the   \nU.S. include GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co. \nLLC (GS&Co.), J. Aron & Company LLC (J. Aron) \nand Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. Our  \nprincipal subsidiaries operating in Europe    \ninclude Goldman Sachs International (GSI),    \nGSIB and Goldman Sachs Asset Management       \nInternational (GSAMI), which are incorporated \nand headquartered in the U.K., and Goldman    \nSachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE), which is         \nincorporated and headquartered in Germany. Our\nprincipal subsidiaries operating in Asia      \ninclude Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL).\nAs a result of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the \nE.U. (Brexit), we have strengthened the       \ncapabilities of our E.U. operating            \nsubsidiaries, particularly GSBE, and have     \nmoved certain activities there. For example,  \nwe have moved a number of relationships with  \nclients of our Investment Banking, Global     \nMarkets and Wealth Management businesses from \nGSI and GSIB to GSBE, and clients of our Asset\nManagement business from GSAMI to GSBE;       \nestablished access for GSBE to exchanges,     \nclearing houses and depositories and other    \nmarket infrastructure in the E.U.; established\nbranches of GSBE in several E.U. member states\nand in the U.K.; and strengthened the capital,\npersonnel and other resources at GSBE. Banking\nSupervision and Regulation Group Inc. is a BHC\nunder the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of    \n1956 (BHC Act) and an FHC under amendments to \nthe BHC Act effected by the U.S. Gramm-Leach- \nBliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act), and is subject  \nto supervision and examination by the FRB,    \nwhich is our primary regulator. The FRB\u2019s     \nrating system for large financial institutions\nis aligned with its supervisory program and is\ncomprised of component ratings for capital    \nplanning and positions, liquidity risk        \nmanagement and positions, and governance and  \ncontrols. Under the system of \u201cfunctional     \nregulation\u201d established under the BHC Act, the\nprimary regulators of our U.S. non-           \nbanksubsidiaries directly regulate the        \nactivities of those subsidiaries, with the FRB\nexercising a supervisory role. Such           \n\u201cfunctionally regulated\u201d subsidiaries include \nbroker-dealers and security-based swap dealers\nregistered with the SEC, such as our principal\nU.S. broker-dealer, GS&Co., entities          \nregistered with or regulated by the CFTC with \nrespect to futures-related and swaps-related  \nactivities and investment advisers registered \nwith the SEC with respect to their investment \nadvisory activities. Our principal U.S. bank  \nsubsidiary, GS Bank USA, is supervised and    \nregulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York  \nState Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)\nand the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  \n(CFPB). GS Bank USA also has a London branch, \nwhich is regulated by the FCA and PRA, and a  \nTokyo branch, which is regulated by the Japan \nFinancial Services Agency. We conduct a number\nof our activities partially or entirely       \nthrough GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries,     \nincluding: corporate loans (including         \nleveraged lending) and transaction banking;   \nconsumer loans (including installment and     \ncredit card loans); small business loans      \n(including installment, lines of credit and   \ncredit cards); wealth management loans        \n(including mortgages); interest rate, credit, \ncurrency and other derivatives; deposit-      \ntaking; and agency lending. Our E.U.          \nsubsidiaries are subject to various E.U.      \nregulations, as well as national laws,        \nincluding those implementing European         \ndirectives. GSBE is directly supervised by the\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) and additionally  \nby BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank in the       \ncontext of the E.U. Single Supervisory        \nMechanism (SSM). GSBE\u2019s London branch is      \nregulated by the FCA. GSBE engages in certain \nactivities primarily in the E.U., including   \nunderwriting and market making in debt and    \nequity securities and derivatives, investment,\nasset and wealth management services, deposit-\ntaking, lending (including securities         \nlending), and financial advisory services and \nis a primary dealer for government bonds      \nissued by E.U. sovereigns. On July 1, 2021,   \nGSBE became a subsidiary of GS Bank USA. As a \nforeign bank subsidiary of GS Bank USA, GSBE  \nis subject to limits on the nature and scope  \nof its activities under the FRB\u2019s Regulation  \nK, including limits on its underwriting and   \nmarket making in equity securities based on   \nGSBE\u2019s and/or GS Bank USA\u2019s capital.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur principal subsidiaries in the U.K. include\nGSI, a U.K. broker-dealer and a designated    \ninvestment firm, and GSIB, a U.K. bank. Both  \nGSI and GSIB are regulated by the PRA and the \nFCA. As an investment firm, GSI is subject to \nprudential requirements applicable to banks,  \nincluding capital and liquidity requirements. \nGSI provides broker-dealer services in and    \nfrom the U.K. and is registered with the CFTC \nas a swap dealer and with the SEC as a        \nsecurities-based swap dealer. GSIB engages in \nlending (including securities lending) and    \ndeposit-taking activities and is a primary    \ndealer for U.K. government bonds. GSI and GSIB\nmaintain branches outside of the U.K. and are \nsubject to the laws and regulations of the    \njurisdictions where they are located. Capital \nand Liquidity Requirements. We and GS Bank USA\nare subject to regulatory risk-based capital  \nand leverage requirements that are calculated \nin accordance with the regulations of the FRB \n(Capital Framework). The Capital Framework is \nlargely based on the Basel Committee\u2019s        \nframework for strengthening the regulation,   \nsupervision and risk management of banks      \n(Basel III) and also implements certain       \nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the   \nU.S. federal bank regulatory agencies\u2019        \ntailoring framework, we and GS Bank USA are   \nsubject to \u201cCategory I\u201d standards because we  \nhave been designated as a global systemically \nimportant bank (G-SIB).Accordingly, we and GS \nBank USA are \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking      \norganizations. Under the Capital Framework, we\nand GS Bank USA must meet specific regulatory \ncapital requirements that involve quantitative\nmeasures of assets, liabilities and certain   \noff-balancesheet items. The sufficiency of our\ncapital levels is also subject to qualitative \njudgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA   \nare also subject to liquidity requirements    \nestablished by the U.S. federal bank          \nregulatory agencies. GSBE is subject to       \ncapital and liquidity requirements prescribed \nin the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation,  \nas amended (CRR), and the E.U. Capital        \nRequirements Directive, as amended (CRD),     \nwhich are largely based on Basel III. The most\nrecent previous amendments to the CRR and CRD \n(respectively, CRR II and CRD V) include      \nchanges to the market risk, counterparty      \ncredit risk, large exposures and leverage     \nratio frameworks. These changes have been     \napplicable in the E.U. since June 2021. GSI   \nand GSIB are subject to the U.K. capital and  \nliquidity frameworks, which are also largely  \nbased on Basel III and remain predominantly   \naligned with the E.U. capital and liquidity   \nframeworks. Amendments similar to CRR II and  \nCRD V became applicable in the U.K. on January\n1, 2022. Requirements established by E.U. and \nU.K. authorities are therefore similar to     \nthose applicable to GS Bank USA and us. Risk- \nBased Capital Ratios. As Advanced approach    \nbanking organizations, we and GS Bank USA     \ncalculate risk-based capital ratios in        \naccordance with both the Standardized and     \nAdvanced Capital Rules. Both the Advanced     \nCapital Rules and the Standardized Capital    \nRules include minimum risk-based capital      \nrequirements and additional capital           \nconservation buffer requirements that must be \nsatisfied solely with Common Equity Tier 1    \n(CET1) capital. Failure to satisfy a buffer   \nrequirement in full would result in           \nconstraints on capital distributions and      \ndiscretionary executive compensation. The     \nseverity of the constraints would depend on   \nthe amount of the shortfall and the           \norganization\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d    \ndefined as the greater of (i) net income for  \nthe four preceding quarters, net of           \ndistributions and associated tax effects not  \nreflected in net income; and (ii) the average \nof net income over the preceding four         \nquarters. For Group Inc., the capital         \nconservation buffer requirements consist of a \n2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital       \nRules), a stress capital buffer (SCB) (under  \nthe Standardized Capital Rules), and both a   \ncountercyclical buffer and the G-SIBsurcharge \n(under both Capital Rules). For GS Bank USA,  \nthe capital conservation buffer requirements  \nconsist of a 2.5% buffer and the              \ncountercyclical capital buffer. The SCB is    \nbased on the results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s \nsupervisory stress tests and our planned      \ncommon stock dividends and is likely to change\nover time based on the results of the annual  \nsupervisory stress tests. See \u201cStress Tests   \nand Capital Planning\u201d below. The              \ncountercyclical capital buffer is designed to \ncounteract systemic vulnerabilities and       \ncurrently applies only to banking             \norganizations subject to Category I, II or III\nstandards, including us and GS Bank USA.      \nSeveral other national supervisors also       \nrequire countercyclical capital buffers. The  \nG-SIBsurcharge and countercyclical capital    \nbuffer applicable to us may change in the     \nfuture including due to additional guidance   \nfrom our regulators and/or positional changes.\nAs a result, the minimum capital ratios to    \nwhich we are subject are likely to change over\ntime. The U.S. federal bank regulatory        \nagencies have a rule that implements the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s standardized approach for         \nmeasuring counterparty credit risk exposures  \nin connection with derivative contracts (SA-  \nCCR).Under the rule, \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d      \nbanking organizations are required to use SA- \nCCRfor calculating their standardized risk-   \nweighted assets (RWAs) and, with some         \nadjustments, for purposes of determining their\nsupplementary leverage ratios (SLRs) discussed\nbelow.                                        \n                                      \n  12    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and \nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations \u2014 Capital Management and Regulatory\nCapital\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form      \n10-Kand Note 20 to the consolidated financial \nstatements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form    \n10-Kfor information about our capital ratios  \nand those of GS Bank USA, GSBE, GSI and GSIB. \nThe Basel Committee standards include         \nguidelines for calculating incremental capital\nratio requirements for banking institutions   \nthat are systemically significant from a      \ndomestic but not global perspective           \n(D-SIBs).Depending on how these guidelines are\nimplemented by national regulators, they may  \napply, among others, to certain subsidiaries  \nof G-SIBs.These guidelines are in addition to \nthe framework for G-SIBs,but are more         \nprinciples-based. The CRD and CRR provide that\ninstitutions that are systemically important  \nat the E.U. or member state level, known as   \nother systemically important institutions     \n(O-SIIs),may be subject to additional capital \nratio requirements, according to their degree \nof systemic importance (O-SIIbuffers). In     \n2021, BaFin identified GSBE as an O-SIIin     \nGermany and set an O-SIIbuffer, applicable    \nfrom January 1, 2022. In the U.K., the PRA has\nidentified Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited (GSG\nUK), the parent company of GSI and GSIB, as an\nO-SIIbut has not applied an O-SIIbuffer. The  \nBasel Committee has finalized revisions to the\nframework for calculating capital requirements\nfor market risk as part of its Fundamental    \nReview of the Trading Book (FRTB). These      \nrevisions are expected to increase market risk\ncapital requirements for most banking         \norganizations and large broker-dealers subject\nto bank capital requirements. The revised     \nframework, among other things, revises the    \nstandardized and internal model-based         \napproaches used to calculate market risk      \nrequirements and clarifies the scope of       \npositions subject to market risk capital      \nrequirements. The Basel Committee framework   \ncontemplates that national regulators         \nimplement the revised framework by January 1, \n2023. The U.S. federal bank regulatory        \nagencies have not yet proposed rules          \nimplementing the revised framework. Under the \nCRR, E.U. financial institutions commenced    \nreporting their market risk calculations under\nthe revised framework in the third quarter of \n2021. U.K. authorities have not yet proposed  \nrules to implement this framework. The Basel  \nCommittee published standards that it         \ndescribed as the finalization of the Basel III\npost-crisis regulatory reforms (Basel III     \nRevisions). These standards set a floor on    \ninternally modeled capital requirements at a  \npercentage of the capital requirements under  \nthe standardized approach. They also revise   \nthe Basel Committee\u2019s standardized and        \ninternal model-based approaches for credit    \nrisk, provide a new standardized approach for \noperational risk capital and revise the       \nframeworks for credit valuation adjustment    \n(CVA) risk. The Basel Committee framework     \ncontemplates that national regulators         \nimplement these standards by January 1, 2023, \nand that the new floor be phased in through   \nJanuary 1, 2028. In July 2020, the Basel      \nCommittee finalized further revisions to the  \nframework for CVA risk, which are intended to \nalign that framework with the market risk     \nframework. The U.S. federal bank regulatory   \nauthorities have not yet proposed rules       \nimplementing the Basel III Revisions for      \npurposes of their risk-based capital ratios.  \nThe European Commission proposed rules to     \nimplement the Basel III Revisions in October  \n2021. The proposed E.U. rules contemplate     \namendments to the CRR and the CRD, referred to\nas CRR III and CRD VI, to take effect in      \nJanuary 2025. The U.K. authorities have not   \nyet released a proposal on the Basel III      \nRevisions. The Basel Committee has also       \npublished an updated securitization framework \nand a revised G-SIBassessment methodology, but\nthe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have\nnot yet proposed rules implementing them. The \nupdated securitization framework has been     \nimplemented in the E.U. and U.K. Leverage     \nRatios. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS\nBank USA are subject to Tier 1 leverage ratios\nand SLRs established by the FRB. As a         \nG-SIB,the SLR requirements applicable to us   \ninclude both a minimum requirement and a      \nbuffer requirement, which operates in the same\nmanner as the risk-based buffer requirements  \ndescribed above. In April 2018, the FRB and   \nthe OCC issued a proposed rule which would (i)\nreplace the current 2% SLR buffer for         \nG-SIBs,including us, with a buffer equal to   \n50% of their G-SIBsurcharge and (ii) revise   \nthe 6% SLR requirement for Category I banks,  \nsuch as GS Bank USA, to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d \nwith a requirement equal to 3% plus 50% of    \ntheir parent\u2019s G-SIBsurcharge. This proposal, \ntogether with the adopted rule requiring use  \nof SA-CCRfor purposes of calculating the SLR, \nwould implement certain of the revisions to   \nthe leverage ratio framework published by the \nBasel Committee in December 2017.             \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    13  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGSBE and certain of our U.K. entities,        \nincluding GSI and GSIB, are also subject to   \nrequirements relating to leverage ratios,     \nwhich are generally based on the Basel        \nCommittee leverage ratio standards. See       \n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of      \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations \n\u2014 Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\u201d  \nin Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-Kand Note  \n20 to the consolidated financial statements in\nPart II, Item 8 of this Form 10-Kfor          \ninformation about our and GS Bank USA\u2019s Tier 1\nleverage ratios and SLRs, and GSI\u2019s leverage  \nratio. Liquidity Ratios. The Basel Committee\u2019s\nframework for liquidity risk measurement,     \nstandards and monitoring requires banking     \norganizations to measure their liquidity      \nagainst two specific liquidity tests: the     \nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net    \nStable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The LCR rule     \nissued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory    \nagencies and applicable to both us and GS Bank\nUSA is generally consistent with the Basel    \nCommittee\u2019s framework and is designed to      \nensure that a banking organization maintains  \nan adequate level of unencumbered, high-      \nquality liquid assets equal to or greater than\nthe expected net cash outflows under an acute \nshort-term liquidity stress scenario. We and  \nGS Bank USA are required to maintain a minimum\nLCR of 100%. See \u201cAvailable Information\u201d below\nand \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of  \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations \n\u2014 Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\u201d  \nin Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-Kfor       \ninformation about our average daily LCR. GSBE \nis subject to the LCR rule issued by the      \nEuropean Commission, and GSI and GSIB are     \nsubject to the U.K. prudential framework\u2019s LCR\nrules. These rules are generally consistent   \nwith the Basel Committee\u2019s framework. The NSFR\nis designed to promote medium- and long-term  \nstable funding of the assets and off-         \nbalancesheet activities of banking            \norganizations over a one-yeartime horizon. The\nBasel Committee\u2019s NSFR framework requires     \nbanking organizations to maintain a minimum   \nNSFR of 100%. The U.S. federal bank regulatory\nagencies issued a final rule, which became    \neffective in July 2021, implementing the NSFR \nfor large U.S. banking organizations,         \nincluding us and GS Bank USA. We will be      \nrequired to publicly disclose our quarterly   \naverage daily NSFR semiannually beginning in  \n2023. The CRR implemented the NSFR for certain\nE.U. financial institutions, including GSBE,  \nwhich became effective in June 2021. The NSFR \nrequirement implemented in the U.K. became    \neffective in January 2022 and is applicable to\nboth GSI and GSIB. The FRB\u2019s enhanced         \nprudential standards require BHCs with $100   \nbillion or more in total consolidated assets  \nto comply with enhanced liquidity and overall \nrisk management standards, which include      \nmaintaining a level of highly liquid assets   \nbased on projected funding needs for 30 days, \nand increased involvement by boards of        \ndirectors in liquidity and overall risk       \nmanagement. Although the liquidity requirement\nunder these rules has some similarities to the\nLCR, it is a separate requirement. GSBE also  \nhas its own liquidity planning process, which \nincorporates internally designed stress tests \nand those required under German regulatory    \nrequirements and the ECB Guide to Internal    \nLiquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP).\nGSI and GSIB have their own liquidity planning\nprocesses, which incorporate internally       \ndesigned stress tests developed in accordance \nwith the guidelines of the PRA\u2019s ILAAP.

Stress Tests and Capital Planning. \nThe FRB\u2019s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and  \nReview (CCAR) is designed to ensure that large\nBHCs, including us, have sufficient capital to\npermit continued operations during times of   \neconomic and financial stress. As required by \nthe FRB, we perform an annual capital stress  \ntest and incorporate the results into an      \nannual capital plan, which we submit to the   \nFRB for review. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion  \nand Analysis of Financial Condition and       \nResults of Operations \u2014 Risk Management \u2014     \nOverview and Structure of Risk Management \u2014   \nCapital Risk Management\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of\nthis Form 10-Kfor further information about   \nour annual capital plan. As described in      \n\u201cAvailable Information\u201d below, summary results\nof the annual stress test are published on our\nwebsite. As part of the CCAR process, the FRB \nevaluates our plan to make capital            \ndistributions across a range of macroeconomic \nand company-specific assumptions, based on our\nand the FRB\u2019s own stress tests.               \n                                      \n  14    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe FRB\u2019s rule applicable to BHCs with $100   \nbillion or more in total consolidated assets, \nincluding us, replaced the static 2.5%        \ncomponent of the capital conservation buffer  \nrequired under the Standardized Capital Rules \nwith the SCB. The SCB reflects stressed losses\nestimated under the supervisory severely      \nadverse scenario of the CCAR stress tests, as \ncalculated by the FRB, and includes four      \nquarters of planned common stock dividends.   \nThe SCB, which is subject to a 2.5% floor, is \ngenerally effective on October 1 of each year \nand remains in effect until October 1 of the  \nfollowing year, unless it is reset in         \nconnection with the resubmission of a capital \nplan. See \u201cAvailable Information\u201d below and   \n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of      \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations \n\u2014 Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\u201d  \nin Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-Kfor       \ninformation about our SCB requirement. The    \nfinal rule implementing the SCB requires a BHC\nto receive the FRB\u2019s approval for any         \ndividend, stock repurchase or other capital   \ndistribution, other than a capital            \ndistribution on a newly issued capital        \ninstrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit\nits capital plan. U.S. depository institutions\nwith total consolidated assets of $250 billion\nor more that are subsidiaries of U.S.         \nG-SIBsare required to submit annual company-  \nrunstress test results to the FRB. As a result\nof recent growth in its balance sheet, GS Bank\nUSA will be required to submit its annual     \nstress test results in 2022. GSBE also has its\nown capital and stress testing process, which \nincorporates internally designed stress tests \nand those required under German regulatory    \nrequirements and the ECB Guide to Internal    \nCapital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).  \nIn addition, GSI and GSIB have their own      \ncapital planning and stress testing processes,\nwhich incorporate internally designed stress  \ntests developed in accordance with the PRA\u2019s  \nICAAP guidelines. U.S. federal and state laws \nimpose limitations on the payment of dividends\nby U.S. depository institutions, such as GS   \nBank USA. In general, the amount of dividends \nthat may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to \nthe lesser of the amounts calculated under a  \nrecent earnings test and an undivided profits \ntest. Under the recent earnings test, a       \ndividend may not be paid if the total of all  \ndividends declared by the entity in any       \ncalendar year is in excess of the current     \nyear\u2019s net income combined with the retained  \nnet income of the two preceding years, unless \nthe entity obtains regulatory approval. Under \nthe undivided profits test, a dividend may not\nbe paid in excess of the entity\u2019s undivided   \nprofits (generally, accumulated net profits   \nthat have not been paid out as dividends or   \ntransferred to surplus), unless the entity    \nreceives regulatory and stockholder approval. \nAs a result of dividend payments from GS Bank \nUSA to Group Inc. in connection with the      \nacquisition of GSBE in July 2021, GS Bank USA \ncannot currently declare any dividends without\nregulatory approval. The applicable U.S.      \nbanking regulators have authority to prohibit \nor limit the payment of dividends if, in the  \nbanking regulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a     \ndividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound\npractice in light of the financial condition  \nof the banking organization. Source of        \nStrength. The Dodd-Frank Act requires BHCs to \nact as a source of strength to their U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries and to commit capital and        \nfinancial resources to support those          \nsubsidiaries. This support may be required by \nthe FRB at times when BHCs might otherwise    \ndetermine not to provide it. Capital loans by \na BHC to a U.S. subsidiary bank are           \nsubordinate in right of payment to deposits   \nand to certain other indebtedness of the      \nsubsidiary bank. In addition, if a BHC commits\nto a U.S. federal banking agency that it will \nmaintain the capital of its bank subsidiary,  \nwhether in response to the FRB\u2019s invoking its \nsource-of-strengthauthority or in response to \nother regulatory measures, that commitment    \nwill be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for \nthe BHC and the bank will be entitled to      \npriority payment in respect of that           \ncommitment, ahead of other creditors of the   \nBHC.                                          \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    15  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTransactions Between Affiliates. Transactions \nbetween GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries,      \nincluding GSBE, and Group Inc. or its other   \nsubsidiaries and affiliates are subject to    \nrestrictions under the Federal Reserve Act and\nregulations issued by the FRB. These laws and \nregulations generally limit the types and     \namounts of transactions (such as loans and    \nother credit extensions, including credit     \nexposure arising from resale agreements,      \nsecurities borrowing and derivative           \ntransactions, from GS Bank USA or its         \nsubsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other       \nsubsidiaries and affiliates and purchases of  \nassets by GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries from\nGroup Inc. or its other subsidiaries and      \naffiliates) that may take place and generally \nrequire those transactions, to the extent     \npermitted, to be on market terms or better to \nGS Bank USA or its subsidiaries. These laws   \nand regulations generally do not apply to     \ntransactions between GS Bank USA and its      \nsubsidiaries. Similarly, German regulatory    \nrequirements provide that certain transactions\nbetween GSBE and GS Bank USA or its other     \naffiliates, including Group Inc., must be on  \nmarket terms and are subject to special       \ninternal approval requirements. PRA rules     \nprovide similar requirements for transactions \nbetween GSI and GSIB and their respective     \naffiliates. The BHC Act prohibits the FRB from\nrequiring a payment by a BHC subsidiary to a  \ndepository institution if the functional      \nregulator of that subsidiary objects to the   \npayment. In that case, the FRB could instead  \nrequire the divestiture of the depository     \ninstitution and impose operating restrictions \npending the divestiture. Resolution and       \nRecovery Plans. We are required by the FRB and\nthe FDIC to submit a periodic plan for our    \nrapid and orderly resolution in the event of  \nmaterial financial distress or failure        \n(resolution plan). If these regulators jointly\ndetermine that an institution has failed to   \nremediate identified shortcomings in its      \nresolution plan or that its resolution plan,  \nafter any permitted resubmission, is not      \ncredible or would not facilitate an orderly   \nresolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,    \nthey may jointly impose more stringent        \ncapital, leverage or liquidity requirements or\nrestrictions on growth, activities or         \noperations, or may jointly order the          \ninstitution to divest assets or operations, in\norder to facilitate orderly resolution in the \nevent of failure. The FRB and FDIC have a rule\nrequiring U.S. G-SIBsto submit resolution     \nplans on a two-yearcycle (alternating between \nfull and targeted submissions). We submitted  \nour 2021 resolution plan, which was a targeted\nsubmission, in June 2021. Our next required   \nsubmission is a full submission by July 1,    \n2023. See \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 The application of  \nGroup Inc.\u2019s proposed resolution strategy     \ncould result in greater losses for Group      \nInc.\u2019s security holders\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of\nthis Form 10-Kand \u201cAvailable Information\u201d in  \nPart I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Kfor further   \ninformation about our resolution plan. We are \nalso required by the FRB to submit, on a      \nperiodic basis, a global recovery plan that   \noutlines the steps that we could take to      \nreduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity and\nconserve capital in times of prolonged stress.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are also subject  \nto similar recovery plan requirements. The    \nFDIC has issued a rule requiring each insured \ndepository institution (IDI) with $50 billion \nor more in assets, such as GS Bank USA, to    \nprovide a resolution plan. Our resolution plan\nfor GS Bank USA must, among other things,     \ndemonstrate that it is adequately protected   \nfrom risks arising from our other entities. GS\nBank USA\u2019s most recent resolution plan was    \nsubmitted in June 2018. In January 2021, the  \nFDIC announced its intention to require       \nresolution plan submissions for IDIs with $100\nbillion or more in assets, including GS Bank  \nUSA. In June 2021, the FDIC issued guidance   \nfor those resolution plans. This guidance     \nsplits covered IDIs into two groups for       \npurposes of the timing of resolution plan     \nsubmissions, and GS Bank USA is in the second \ngroup with a later submission date. The U.S.  \nfederal bank regulatory agencies have adopted \nrules imposing restrictions on qualified      \nfinancial contracts (QFCs) entered into by    \nG-SIBs.The rules are intended to facilitate   \nthe orderly resolution of a failed G-SIBby    \nlimiting the ability of the G-SIBto enter into\na QFC unless (i) the counterparty waives      \ncertain default rights in such contract       \narising upon the entry of the G-SIBor one of  \nits affiliates into resolution, (ii) the      \ncontract does not contain enumerated          \nprohibitions on the transfer of such contract \nand/or any related credit enhancement, and    \n(iii) the counterparty agrees that the        \ncontract will be subject to the special       \nresolution regimes set forth in the Dodd-Frank\nAct orderly liquidation authority (OLA) and   \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950     \n(FDIA), described below. GS Bank USA has      \nachieved compliance by adhering to the        \nInternational Swaps and Derivatives           \nAssociation Universal Resolution Stay Protocol\n(ISDA Universal Protocol) and International   \nSwaps and Derivatives Association 2018 U.S.   \nResolution Stay Protocol (U.S. ISDA Protocol) \ndescribed below. Certain of our subsidiaries  \nalso adhere to these protocols. The ISDA      \nUniversal Protocol imposes a stay on certain  \ncross-default and early termination rights    \nwithin standard ISDA derivative contracts and \nsecurities financing transactions between     \nadhering parties in the event that one of them\nis subject to resolution in its home          \njurisdiction, including a resolution under OLA\nor the FDIA in the U.S. The U.S. ISDA         \nProtocol, which was based on the ISDA         \nUniversal Protocol, was created to allow      \nmarket participants to comply with the final  \nQFC rules adopted by the federal bank         \nregulatory agencies.                          \n                                      \n  16    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution         \nDirective (BRRD), as amended by the BRRD II,  \nestablishes a framework for the recovery and  \nresolution of financial institutions in the   \nE.U., such as GSBE. The BRRD provides national\nsupervisory authorities with tools and powers \nto pre-emptivelyaddress potential financial   \ncrises in order to promote financial stability\nand minimize taxpayers\u2019 exposure to losses.   \nThe BRRD requires E.U. member states to grant \ncertain resolution powers to national and,    \nwhere relevant, E.U. resolution authorities,  \nincluding the power to impose a temporary stay\nand to recapitalize a failing entity by       \nwriting down its unsecured debt or converting \nits unsecured debt into equity. Financial     \ninstitutions in the E.U. must provide that    \ncontracts governed by non-E.U.law recognize   \nthose temporary stay and bail-inpowers unless \ndoing so would be impracticable. GSBE is under\nthe direct authority of the Single Resolution \nBoard for resolution planning. Regulatory     \nauthorities in the E.U. may require financial \ninstitutions in the E.U., including           \nsubsidiaries of non-E.U.groups, to submit     \nrecovery plans and to assist the relevant     \nresolution authority in constructing          \nresolution plans for the E.U. entities. GSBE\u2019s\nprimary regulator with respect to recovery    \nplanning is the ECB, and it is also regulated \nby BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank. The U.K.    \nSpecial Resolution Regime confers             \nsubstantially the same powers on the Bank of  \nEngland, as the U.K. resolution authority, and\nsubstantially the same requirements on U.K.   \nfinancial institutions. Further, certain U.K. \nfinancial institutions, including GSI and     \nGSIB, are required to meet the Bank of        \nEngland\u2019s expectations contained in the U.K.  \nResolution Assessment Framework, including    \nwith respect to loss absorbency, contractual  \nstays, operational continuity and funding in  \nresolution. They are also required by the PRA \nto submit solvent wind-down plans on how they \ncould be wound down in a stressed environment.\nThe PRA is also the regulatory authority in   \nthe U.K. that supervises recovery planning,   \nand GSI and GSIB are each required to submit  \nrecovery plans to the PRA. Total Loss-        \nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC). The FRB has issued \na rule addressing U.S. implementation of the  \nFinancial Stability Board\u2019s (FSB\u2019s) TLAC      \nprinciples and term sheet on minimum TLAC     \nrequirements for G-SIBs.The rule (i)          \nestablishes minimum TLAC requirements; (ii)   \nestablishes minimum requirements for \u201celigible\nlong-term debt\u201d (i.e., debt that is unsecured,\nhas a maturity of at least one year from      \nissuance and satisfies certain additional     \ncriteria); (iii) prohibits certain parent     \ncompany transactions; and (iv) caps the amount\nof parent company liabilities that are not    \neligible long-term debt. The rule also        \nprohibits a BHC that has been designated as a \nU.S. G-SIBfrom (i) guaranteeing subsidiaries\u2019 \nliabilities that are subject to early         \ntermination provisions if the BHC enters into \nan insolvency or receivership proceeding,     \nsubject to an exception for guarantees        \npermitted by rules of the U.S. federal banking\nagencies imposing restrictions on QFCs; (ii)  \nincurring liabilities guaranteed by           \nsubsidiaries; (iii) issuing short-term debt to\nthird parties; or (iv) entering into          \nderivatives and certain other financial       \ncontracts with external counterparties.       \nAdditionally, the rule caps, at 5% of the     \nvalue of the parent company\u2019s eligible TLAC,  \nthe amount of unsecured non-contingentthird-  \nparty liabilities that are not eligible long- \nterm debt that could rank equally with or     \njunior to eligible long-term debt. The FRB,   \nthe OCC and the FDIC issued a final rule,     \neffective April 1, 2021, requiring \u201cAdvanced  \napproach\u201d banking organizations, such as us,  \nto deduct from their own regulatory capital   \ncertain investments above thresholds in       \nunsecured debt instruments issued by          \nG-SIBs,including those issued for purposes of \nsatisfying TLAC requirements. The CRR and the \nBRRD are designed to, among other things,     \nimplement the FSB\u2019s minimum TLAC requirement  \nfor G-SIBs.For example, the CRR requires E.U. \nsubsidiaries of a non-E.U. G-SIBto meet       \ninternal TLAC requirements if they exceed the \nthreshold of 5% of the G-SIB\u2019sRWAs, operating \nincome or leverage exposure. GSBE does not    \ncurrently exceed these thresholds. Under the  \nU.K. financial services regime, GSG UK exceeds\nthe applicable thresholds and therefore, it is\nsubject to internal TLAC requirements. The CRD\nrequires a non-E.U.group with more than \u20ac40   \nbillion of assets in the E.U., such as us, to \nestablish an E.U. intermediate holding company\n(E.U. IHC) by December 30, 2023 if it has, as \nin our case, two or more of certain types of  \nE.U. financial institution subsidiaries,      \nincluding broker-dealers and banks. A         \nnon-E.U.group may have two E.U. IHCs if a     \nrequest for a second is approved. The CRR     \nrequires E.U. IHCs to satisfy capital and     \nliquidity requirements, a minimum requirement \nfor own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL),\nand certain other prudential requirements at a\nconsolidated level. The U.K. has not          \nimplemented the requirement for an IHC;       \nhowever, the PRA has introduced a requirement \nto approve or exempt certain U.K. financial   \nholding companies, including GSG UK, which    \nbecame effective in January 2022.             \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    17  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDeposit Insurance. Deposits at GS Bank USA    \nhave the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the  \napplicable limits. The FDIC\u2019s Deposit         \nInsurance Fund is funded by assessments on    \nIDIs. GS Bank USA\u2019s assessment (subject to    \nadjustment by the FDIC) is currently based on \nits average total consolidated assets less its\naverage tangible equity during the assessment \nperiod, its supervisory ratings and specified \nforward-looking financial measures used to    \ncalculate the assessment rate. The deposits of\nGSBE are covered by the German statutory      \ndeposit protection program to the extent      \nprovided by law. In addition, GSBE has elected\nto participate in the German voluntary deposit\nprotection program which provides insurance   \nfor certain eligible deposits not covered by  \nthe German statutory deposit program. Deposits\nat GSIB are covered by the U.K. Financial     \nServices Compensation Scheme up to the        \napplicable limits. Prompt Corrective Action.  \nThe U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nImprovement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires the \nU.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take \n\u201cprompt corrective action\u201d in respect of      \ndepository institutions that do not meet      \nspecified capital requirements. FDICIA        \nestablishes five capital categories for FDIC- \ninsured banks, such as GS Bank USA: well-     \ncapitalized, adequately capitalized,          \nundercapitalized, significantly               \nundercapitalized and critically               \nundercapitalized. An institution may be       \ndowngraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital  \ncategory that is lower than is indicated by   \nits capital ratios if it is determined to be  \nin an unsafe or unsound condition or if it    \nreceives an unsatisfactory examination rating \nwith respect to certain matters. FDICIA       \nimposes progressively more restrictive        \nconstraints on operations, management and     \ncapital distributions, as the capital category\nof an institution declines. Failure to meet   \nthe capital requirements could also require a \ndepository institution to raise capital.      \nUltimately, critically undercapitalized       \ninstitutions are subject to the appointment of\na receiver or conservator, as described in    \n\u201cInsolvency of an IDI or a BHC\u201d above. The    \nprompt corrective action regulations do not   \napply to BHCs. However, the FRB is authorized \nto take appropriate action at the BHC level,  \nbased upon the undercapitalized status of the \nBHC\u2019s depository institution subsidiaries. In \ncertain instances, relating to an             \nundercapitalized depository institution       \nsubsidiary, the BHC would be required to      \nguarantee the performance of the              \nundercapitalized subsidiary\u2019s capital         \nrestoration plan and might be liable for civil\nmoney damages for failure to fulfill its      \ncommitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in\nthe event of the bankruptcy of the BHC, the   \nguarantee would take priority over the BHC\u2019s  \ngeneral unsecured creditors, as described in  \n\u201cSource of Strength\u201d above. Volcker Rule and  \nOther Restrictions on Activities. As a BHC, we\nare subject to limitations on the types of    \nbusiness activities in which we may engage.   \nVolcker Rule. The Volcker Rule prohibits      \n\u201cproprietary trading,\u201d but permits activities \nsuch as underwriting, market making and risk- \nmitigation hedging, requires an extensive     \ncompliance program and includes additional    \nreporting and record-keeping requirements. In \naddition, the Volcker Rule limits the         \nsponsorship of, and investment in, \u201ccovered   \nfunds\u201d (as defined in the rule) by banking    \nentities, including us. It also limits certain\ntypes of transactions between us and our      \nsponsored and advised funds, similar to the   \nlimitations on transactions between depository\ninstitutions and their affiliates. Covered    \nfunds include our private equity funds,       \ncertain of our credit and real estate funds,  \nour hedge funds and certain other investment  \nstructures. The limitation on investments in  \ncovered funds requires us to limit our        \ninvestment in each such fund to 3% or less of \nthe fund\u2019s net asset value, and to limit our  \naggregate investment in all such funds to 3%  \nor less of our Tier 1 capital. The FRB has    \nextended the conformance period to July 2022  \nfor our investments in, and relationships     \nwith, certain legacy \u201cilliquid funds\u201d (as     \ndefined in the Volcker Rule) that were in     \nplace prior to December 2013. See Note 8 to   \nthe consolidated financial statements in Part \nII, Item 8 of this Form 10-Kfor further       \ninformation about our investments in such     \nfunds. Other Restrictions. FHCs generally can \nengage in a broader range of financial and    \nrelated activities than are otherwise         \npermissible for BHCs as long as they continue \nto meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs.\nThe broader range of permissible activities   \nfor FHCs includes underwriting, dealing and   \nmaking markets in securities and making       \ninvestments in non-FHCs(merchant banking      \nactivities). In addition, certain FHCs,       \nincluding us, are permitted to engage in      \ncertain commodities activities in the U.S.    \nthat may otherwise be impermissible for BHCs, \nso long as the assets held pursuant to these  \nactivities do not equal 5% or more of their   \nconsolidated assets. The FRB, however, has the\nauthority to limit an FHC\u2019s ability to conduct\nactivities that would otherwise be            \npermissible, and will likely do so if the FHC \ndoes not satisfactorily meet certain          \nrequirements of the FRB. For example, if an   \nFHC or any of its U.S. depository institution \nsubsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as \nwell-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB may \nimpose corrective capital and/or managerial   \nrequirements, as well as additional           \nlimitations or conditions. If the deficiencies\npersist, the FHC may be required to divest its\nU.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to\ncease engaging in activities other than the   \nbusiness of banking and certain closely       \nrelated activities.                           \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    19  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIf any IDI subsidiary of an FHC fails to      \nmaintain at least a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating     \nunder the Community Reinvestment Act, the FHC \nwould be subject to restrictions on certain   \nnew activities and acquisitions. In addition, \nwe are required to obtain prior FRB approval  \nbefore certain acquisitions and before        \nengaging in certain banking and other         \nfinancial activities both within and outside  \nthe U.S. The FRB issued a proposed rule in    \nSeptember 2016 which, if adopted, would impose\nnew requirements on the physical commodity    \nactivities and certain merchant banking       \nactivities of FHCs, including, among other    \nthings, additional capital requirements,      \nstringent quantitative limits on permissible  \nphysical trading activity, and new public     \nreporting requirements. At that time, the FRB \nrecommended that Congress repeal authorities  \nfor FHCs to engage in merchant banking        \nactivities and for certain FHCs to engage in  \ncertain otherwise impermissible commodities   \nactivities. U.S. G-SIBs,like us, are also     \nrequired to comply with a rule regarding      \nsingle counterparty credit limits, which      \nimposes more stringent requirements for credit\nexposures among major financial institutions. \nThe Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FRB to   \nimplement early remediation requirements,     \nwhich were proposed in 2011 but not finalized.\nThe New York State banking law imposes lending\nlimits (which take into account credit        \nexposure from derivative transactions) and    \nother requirements that could impact the      \nmanner and scope of GS Bank USA\u2019s activities. \nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have\nissued guidance that focuses on transaction   \nstructures and risk management frameworks and \nthat outlines high-level principles for safe- \nand-soundleveraged lending, including         \nunderwriting standards, valuation and stress  \ntesting. This guidance has, among other       \nthings, limited the percentage amount of debt \nthat can be included in certain transactions. \nAs a German credit institution, GSBE will     \nbecome subject to Volcker Rule-type           \nprohibitions under German banking law and     \nregulations once its financial assets exceed  \ncertain thresholds. Prohibited activities will\nthen include proprietary trading, certain     \ntypes of high-frequency trading and certain   \ntypes of lending and guarantee businesses with\ndefined prohibited counterparties, such as    \nhedge funds and other highly leveraged funds, \nunless an exclusion or an exemption applies.  \nSee \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d above for further          \ninformation. U.K. banks that have over \u00a325    \nbillion of core retail deposits are required  \nto separate their retail banking services from\ntheir investment and international banking    \nactivities, commonly known as \u201cring-fencing.\u201d \nGSIB is not currently subject to the ring-    \nfencing requirement, and if it were to become \nsubject to it, GSIB would need to make        \nsignificant operational and structural        \nchanges. Broker-Dealer and Securities         \nRegulation Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are \nsubject to regulations that cover all aspects \nof the securities business, including sales   \nmethods, trade practices, the use and         \nsafekeeping of clients\u2019 funds and securities, \ncapital structure, record-keeping, the        \nfinancing of clients\u2019 purchases, and the      \nconduct of directors, officers and employees. \nIn the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency    \nresponsible for the administration of the     \nfederal securities laws. GS&Co. is registered \nas a broker-dealer, a securities-based swap   \ndealer, a municipal advisor and an investment \nadviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in\nall 50 states and the District of Columbia.   \nU.S. self-regulatory organizations, such as   \nFINRA and the NYSE, adopt rules that apply to,\nand examine, broker-dealers such as GS&Co.    \nU.S. state securities and other U.S.          \nregulators also have regulatory or oversight  \nauthority over GS&Co.

In Europe, we provide broker-  \ndealer services, including through GSBE (which\nis a credit institution), GSPIC and GSI, that \nare subject to oversight by European and      \nnational regulators. These services are       \nregulated in accordance with E.U., U.K. and   \nnational laws and regulations. These laws     \nrequire, among other things, compliance with  \ncertain capital adequacy and liquidity        \nstandards, customer protection requirements   \nand market conduct and trade reporting rules. \nCertain of our European subsidiaries are also \nregulated by the securities, derivatives and  \ncommodities exchanges of which they are       \nmembers.

Our exchange-based market-making  \nactivities are subject to extensive regulation\nby a number of securities exchanges. As a     \nmarket maker on exchanges, we are required to \nmaintain orderly markets in the securities to \nwhich we are assigned. In the E.U. and the    \nU.K., the European Markets in Financial       \nInstruments Directive (MiFID II) includes     \nextensive market structure reforms, such as   \nthe establishment of new trading venue        \ncategories for the purposes of discharging the\nobligation to trade OTC derivatives on a      \ntrading platform and enhanced pre-and post-   \ntrade transparency covering a wider range of  \nfinancial instruments. In equities, MiFID II  \nintroduced volume caps on non-                \ntransparentliquidity trading for trading      \nvenues, limited the use of broker-dealer      \ncrossing networks and created a new regime for\nsystematic internalizers, which are investment\nfirms that execute client transactions outside\na trading venue. Additional control           \nrequirements were introduced for algorithmic  \ntrading, high frequency trading and direct    \nelectronic access. Commodities trading firms  \nare required to calculate their positions and \nadhere to specific position limits. Other     \nreforms include enhanced transaction          \nreporting, the publication of best execution  \ndata by investment firms and trading venues,  \ntransparency on costs and charges of service  \nto investors, changes to the way investment   \nmanagers can pay for the receipt of investment\nresearch, rules limiting the payment and      \nreceipt of soft commissions and other forms of\ninducements, and mandatory unbundling for     \nbroker-dealers between execution and other    \nmajor services. The SEC requires broker-      \ndealers to act in the best interest of their  \ncustomers. Additionally, SEC rules require    \nbroker-dealers to provide a standardized,     \nshort-form disclosure highlighting services   \noffered, applicable standards of conduct, fees\nand costs, the differences between brokerage  \nand advisory services, and any conflicts of   \ninterest. Several states have adopted or      \nproposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty      \nstandards applicable to broker-dealers. The   \nSEC, FINRA and regulators in various          \nnon-U.S.jurisdictions have imposed both       \nconduct-based and disclosure-based            \nrequirements with respect to research reports \nand research analysts and may impose          \nadditional regulations. GS&Co., GS Bank USA   \nand other U.S. subsidiaries are also subject  \nto rules adopted by U.S. federal agencies     \npursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that require   \nany person who organizes or initiates certain \nasset-backed securities transactions to retain\na portion (generally, at least five percent)  \nof any credit risk that the person conveys to \na third party. For certain securitization     \ntransactions, retention by third-party        \npurchasers may satisfy this requirement.      \nCertain of our non-U.S.subsidiaries, including\nGSI, are subject to risk retention            \nrequirements in connection with securitization\nactivities. Swaps, Derivatives and Commodities\nRegulation The commodity futures, commodity   \noptions and swaps industry in the U.S. is     \nsubject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity\nExchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the U.S.      \nfederal agency charged with the administration\nof the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S.  \nfederal agency charged with the regulation of \nsecurity-based swaps. The rules and           \nregulations of various self-regulatory        \norganizations, such as the Chicago Mercantile \nExchange, other futures exchanges and the     \nNational Futures Association, also govern     \ncommodity futures, commodity options and swaps\nactivities. The terms \u201cswaps\u201d and \u201csecurity-  \nbased swaps\u201d include a wide variety of        \nderivative instruments in addition to those   \nconventionally referred to as swaps (including\ncertain forward contracts and options), and   \nrelate to a wide variety of underlying assets \nor obligations, including currencies,         \ncommodities, interest or other monetary rates,\nyields, indices, securities, credit events,   \nloans and other financial obligations.        \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    21  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCFTC rules require registration of swap       \ndealers, mandatory clearing and execution of  \ninterest rate and credit default swaps and    \nreal-time public reporting and adherence to   \nbusiness conduct standards for all in-        \nscopeswaps. A number of these requirements,   \nparticularly those regarding recordkeeping and\nreporting, also apply to transactions that do \nnot involve a registered swap dealer. GS&Co.  \nand other subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA,\nGSBE, GSI and J. Aron, are registered with the\nCFTC as swap dealers. CFTC rules establishing \ncapital requirements for swap dealers that are\nnot subject to the capital rules of a         \nprudential regulator, such as the FRB, became \neffective in October 2021. The CFTC has also  \nadopted financial reporting requirements for  \ncovered swap entities and amended existing    \ncapital rules for CFTC-registered futures     \ncommission merchants to provide explicit      \ncapital requirements for proprietary positions\nin swaps and security-based swaps that are not\ncleared by a clearing organization. Certain of\nour registered swap dealers, including J.     \nAron, are subject to the CFTC\u2019s capital       \nrequirements. Our affiliates registered as    \nswap dealers are subject to the margin rules  \nissued by the CFTC (in the case of our non-   \nbankswap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of \nGS Bank USA and GSBE). The rules for variation\nmargin have become effective, and those for   \ninitial margin are in the process of being    \nphased in through September 2022, depending on\ncertain activity levels of the swap dealer and\nthe relevant counterparty. Inter-affiliate    \ntransactions under the CFTC and FRB margin    \nrules are generally exempt from initial margin\nrequirements. SEC rules govern the            \nregistration and regulation of security-based \nswap dealers. Security-based swaps are defined\nas swaps on single securities, single loans or\nnarrow-based baskets or indices of securities.\nThe SEC has adopted a number of rules for     \nsecurity-based swap dealers, including (i)    \ncapital, margin and segregation requirements; \n(ii) record-keeping, financial reporting and  \nnotification requirements; (iii) business     \nconduct standards; (iv) regulatory and public \ntrade reporting; and (v) the application of   \nrisk mitigation techniques to uncleared       \nportfolios of security-based swaps. The       \ncompliance date for these SEC rules, as well  \nas SEC rules addressing registration          \nrequirements and business conduct standards,  \nwas generally October 2021. In the fourth     \nquarter of 2021, certain of our subsidiaries, \nincluding GS&Co., registered with the SEC as  \nsecurity-based swap dealers and became subject\nto the SEC\u2019s regulations regarding security-  \nbased swaps. The SEC has recently proposed    \nadditional regulations regarding security-    \nbased swaps that would, among other things,   \nrequire public reporting of large positions in\nsecurity-based swaps. The CFTC and the SEC    \nhave adopted rules relating to cross-border   \nregulation of swaps, securities-based swaps,  \nbusiness conduct and registration             \nrequirements. The CFTC and the SEC have       \nentered into agreements with certain          \nnon-U.S.regulators regarding the cross-border \nregulation of derivatives and the mutual      \nrecognition of cross-border execution         \nfacilities and clearing houses, and have      \napproved substituted compliance with certain  \nnon-U.S.regulations related to certain        \nbusiness conduct requirements and margin      \nrules. The U.S. prudential regulators have not\nyet made a determination with respect to      \nsubstituted compliance for transactions       \nsubject to non-U.S.margin rules. Similar types\nof regulation have been proposed or adopted in\njurisdictions outside the U.S., including in  \nthe E.U. and Japan. Under the European Market \nInfrastructure Regulation (EMIR), for example,\nthe E.U. and the U.K. have established        \nregulatory requirements relating to portfolio \nreconciliation and reporting, clearing certain\nOTC derivatives and margining for uncleared   \nderivatives activities. In addition, under the\nEuropean Markets in Financial Instruments     \nDirective and Regulation, transactions in     \ncertain types of derivatives are required to  \nbe executed on regulated platforms or         \nexchanges. The CFTC has adopted rules that    \nlimit the size of positions in physical       \ncommodity derivatives that can be held by any \nentity, or any group of affiliates or other   \nparties trading under common ownership or     \ncontrol. Swap dealers may currently claim an  \nexemption from the position limits for the    \nbona fide hedging of swap-related risks, but  \nthis exemption will be eliminated in 2023. The\nCFTC position limits apply to futures on      \nphysical commodities and options on such      \nfutures, and these limits apply to both       \nphysically and cash settled positions. In     \naddition, in 2023, the position limit rules   \nwill become applicable to swaps that are      \neconomically equivalent to such futures and   \noptions. The position limit rules initially   \nimpose limits in the spot month only (i.e.,   \nduring the delivery period for the physical   \ncommodities, which is typically a period of   \nseveral days). CFTC spot and non- spot month  \nlimits will continue to apply to futures on   \ncertain legacy agricultural commodities, and  \nit is possible that non-spotmonth limits will \nat some point be adopted for other categories \nof commodities.                               \n                                      \n  22    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

As a FERC-authorized power marketer, J.\nAron is subject to regulation under the U.S.  \nFederal Power Act and FERC regulations and to \nthe oversight of FERC. As a result of our     \ninvesting activities, Group Inc. is also an   \n\u201cexempt holding company\u201d under the U.S. Public\nUtility Holding Company Act of 2005 and       \napplicable FERC rules. In addition, as a      \nresult of our power-related and commodities   \nactivities, we are subject to energy,         \nenvironmental and other governmental laws and \nregulations, as described in \u201cRisk Factors \u2014  \nOur commodities activities, particularly our  \nphysical commodities activities, subject us to\nextensive regulation and involve certain      \npotential risks, including environmental,     \nreputational and other risks, that may expose \nus to significant liabilities and costs\u201d in   \nPart I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. GS&Co. is  \nregistered with the CFTC as a futures         \ncommission merchant, and several of our       \nsubsidiaries, including GS&Co., are registered\nwith the CFTC and act as commodity pool       \noperators and commodity trading advisors.     \nGoldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. is      \nregistered with the SEC as an OTC derivatives \ndealer. Asset Management and Wealth Management\nRegulation Our asset management and wealth    \nmanagement businesses are subject to extensive\noversight by regulators around the world      \nrelating to, among other things, the fair     \ntreatment of clients, safeguarding of client  \nassets, offerings of funds, marketing         \nactivities, transactions among affiliates and \nour management of client funds.               \nInterpretations issued by the SEC clarify the \nSEC\u2019s views of the existing fiduciary duty    \nowed by investment advisers to their clients. \nAdditionally, SEC rules require investment    \nadvisers to provide a standardized, short-form\ndisclosure highlighting services offered,     \napplicable standards of conduct, fees and     \ncosts, the differences between brokerage and  \nadvisory services, and any conflicts of       \ninterest. Several states have adopted or      \nproposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty      \nstandards applicable to advisers. Certain of  \nour European subsidiaries, including GSBE in  \nthe E.U. and GSAMI in the U.K., are subject to\nMiFID II and/or related regulations (including\nthe U.K. legislation making such regulations  \npart of U.K. law), which govern the approval, \norganizational, marketing and reporting       \nrequirements of U.K. or E.U.-based investment \nmanagers and the ability of investment fund   \nmanagers located outside the E.U. or the U.K. \nto access those markets. Our asset management \nbusiness in the U.K. and the E.U.             \nsignificantly depends on our ability to       \ndelegate parts of our activities to other     \naffiliates. On January 1, 2022, GSAMI became  \nsubject to a new prudential regime for U.K.   \ninvestment firms, the Investment Firms        \nPrudential Regime (IFPR), which governs the   \nprudential requirements for U.K. investment   \nfirms prudentially regulated by the FCA.      \nConsumer Regulation Our U.S. consumer-oriented\nactivities are subject to supervision and     \nregulation by the CFPB with respect to federal\nconsumer protection laws, including laws      \nrelating to fair lending and the prohibition  \nof unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or       \npractices in connection with the offer, sale  \nor provision of consumer financial products   \nand services. Our consumer-oriented activities\nare also subject to various state and local   \nconsumer protection laws, rules and           \nregulations, which, among other things, impose\nobligations relating to marketing,            \norigination, servicing and collections        \nactivities in our consumer businesses. Many of\nthese laws, rules and regulations also apply  \nto our small business lending activities,     \nwhich are also subject to supervision and     \nregulation by federal and state regulators. In\naddition, our U.K. consumer deposit-taking    \nactivities are subject to consumer protection \nregulations. Compensation Practices Our       \ncompensation practices are subject to         \noversight by the FRB and, with respect to some\nof our subsidiaries and employees, by other   \nregulatory bodies worldwide. The FSB has      \nreleased standards for implementation by local\nregulators that are designed to encourage     \nsound compensation practices at banks and     \nother financial companies. The U.S. federal   \nbank regulatory agencies have also provided   \nguidance designed to ensure that incentive    \ncompensation arrangements at banking          \norganizations take into account risk and are  \nconsistent with safe and sound practices. The \nguidance sets forth the following three key   \nprinciples with respect to incentive          \ncompensation arrangements: (i) the            \narrangements should provide employees with    \nincentives that appropriately balance risk and\nfinancial results in a manner that does not   \nencourage employees to expose their           \norganizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the     \narrangements should be compatible with        \neffective controls and risk management; and   \n(iii) the arrangements should be supported by \nstrong corporate governance. The guidance     \nprovides that supervisory findings with       \nrespect to incentive compensation will be     \nincorporated, as appropriate, into the        \norganization\u2019s supervisory ratings, which can \naffect its ability to make acquisitions or    \nperform other actions. The guidance also notes\nthat enforcement actions may be taken against \na banking organization if its incentive       \ncompensation arrangements or related risk     \nmanagement, control or governance processes   \npose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and  \nsoundness.                                    \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    23  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial    \nregulators, including the FRB and SEC, to     \nadopt rules on incentive-based payment        \narrangements at specified regulated entities  \nhaving at least $1 billion in total assets.   \nThe U.S. financial regulators proposed revised\nrules in 2016, which have not been finalized. \nThe NYDFS\u2019 guidance emphasizes that any       \nincentive compensation arrangements tied to   \nemployee performance indicators at banking    \ninstitutions regulated by the NYDFS, including\nGS Bank USA, must be subject to effective risk\nmanagement, oversight and control. In the     \nE.U., certain provisions in the CRR and CRD   \nare designed to meet the FSB\u2019s compensation   \nstandards. These provisions limit the ratio of\nvariable to fixed compensation of all         \nemployees at GSBE and of certain employees at \nour other operating subsidiaries in the E.U., \nincluding those employees identified as having\na material impact on the risk profile of      \nregulated entities. CRR II and CRD V amended  \ncertain aspects of these rules, including, by \nincreasing minimum variable compensation      \ndeferral periods. Substantially similar       \nrequirements apply in the U.K. in relation to \nGSI and GSIB. The E.U. has also introduced    \nrules regulating compensation for certain     \npersons providing services to certain         \ninvestment funds. Anti-Money Laundering and   \nAnti-Bribery Rules and Regulations The U.S.   \nBank Secrecy Act, as amended (BSA), including \nby the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, contains anti-\nmoney laundering and financial transparency   \nlaws and authorizes or mandates the           \npromulgation of various regulations applicable\nto financial institutions, including standards\nfor verifying client identification at account\nopening, and obligations to monitor client    \ntransactions and report suspicious activities.\nThrough these and other provisions, the BSA   \nseeks, among other things, to promote the     \nidentification of parties that may be involved\nin terrorism, money laundering or other       \nsuspicious activities. The Anti-Money         \nLaundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which amends   \nthe BSA, was enacted in January 2021. The AMLA\nis intended to comprehensively reform and     \nmodernize U.S. anti-money laundering laws.    \nAmong other things, the AMLA codifies a risk- \nbased approach to anti-money laundering       \ncompliance for financial institutions;        \nrequires the U.S. Department of the Treasury  \nto promulgate priorities for anti-money       \nlaundering and countering the financing of    \nterrorism policy; requires the development of \nstandards by the U.S. Department of the       \nTreasury for testing technology and internal  \nprocesses for BSA compliance; expands         \nenforcement- and investigation-related        \nauthority, including a significant expansion  \nin the available sanctions for certain BSA    \nviolations; and expands BSA whistleblower     \nincentives and protections. Many of the       \nstatutory provisions in the AMLA will require \nadditional rulemakings, reports and other     \nmeasures, and the impact of the AMLA will     \ndepend on, among other things, rulemaking and \nimplementation guidance. In June 2021, the    \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),\na bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury,  \nissued the priorities for anti-money          \nlaundering and countering the financing of    \nterrorism policy, as required under the AMLA. \nThe priorities include: corruption,           \ncybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud,       \ntransnational crime, drug trafficking, human  \ntrafficking and proliferation financing. We   \nare subject to other laws and regulations     \nworldwide relating to anti-money laundering   \nand financial transparency, including the E.U.\nAnti-Money Laundering Directives. In addition,\nwe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt    \nPractices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and\nother laws and regulations worldwide regarding\ncorrupt and illegal payments, or providing    \nanything of value, for the benefit of         \ngovernment officials and others. The scope of \nthe types of payments or other benefits       \ncovered by these laws is very broad. These    \nlaws and regulations include requirements     \nrelating to the identification of clients,    \nmonitoring for and reporting suspicious       \ntransactions, monitoring direct and indirect  \npayments to politically exposed persons,      \nproviding information to regulatory           \nauthorities and law enforcement agencies, and \nsharing information with other financial      \ninstitutions.                                 \n                                      \n  24    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nPrivacy and Cyber Security Regulation Our     \nbusinesses are subject to numerous laws and   \nregulations relating to the privacy of        \ninformation regarding clients, employees and  \nothers. These include the GLB Act, the E.U.\u2019s \nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the\nU.K.\u2019s Data Protection Act 2018, the Japanese \nPersonal Information Protection Act, the      \nPersonal Information Protection Law of the    \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PIPL), the Hong   \nKong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, and   \nthe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018   \n(CCPA). The GDPR has heightened our privacy   \ncompliance obligations, impacted certain of   \nour businesses\u2019 collection, processing and    \nretention of personal data and imposed strict \nstandards for reporting data breaches. The    \nGDPR also provides for significant penalties  \nfor non-compliance.In addition, the CCPA      \nimposes compliance obligations with regard to \nthe collection, use and disclosure of personal\ninformation. The CCPA was amended in 2020 by  \nthe California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA),     \nwhich, among other things, will expand the    \nscope of data subject to the CCPA when the    \nCPRA becomes effective on January 1, 2023. In \naddition, several other states and            \nnon-U.S.jurisdictions have enacted, or are    \nproposing, privacy and data protection laws   \nsimilar to the GDPR and the CCPA. The PIPL,   \nwhich went into effect on November 1, 2021,   \nlimits the legal bases for processing personal\ninformation, contains heightened notice and   \nconsent requirements for the handling of      \ncertain types of personal information and     \nimposes special cross-border data transfer    \nrules under certain circumstances. The NYDFS  \nalso requires financial institutions regulated\nby the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, to, among\nother things, (i) establish and maintain a    \ncyber security program designed to ensure the \nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of\ntheir information systems; (ii) implement and \nmaintain a written cyber security policy      \nsetting forth policies and procedures for the \nprotection of their information systems and   \nnonpublic information; and (iii) designate a  \nChief Information Security Officer. In        \nNovember 2021, the U.S. federal bank          \nregulatory agencies adopted a rule regarding  \nnotification requirements for banking         \norganizations related to significant computer-\nsecurity incidents. Under the final rule, a   \nBHC or state member bank, such as Group Inc.  \nor GS Bank USA, is required to notify its     \nprimary regulator within 36 hours of incidents\nthat have materially disrupted or degraded, or\nare reasonably likely to materially disrupt or\ndegrade, the banking organization\u2019s ability to\ndeliver services to a material portion of its \ncustomer base, jeopardize the viability of key\noperations of the banking organization, or    \npose a threat to the financial stability of   \nthe United States. The rule is effective April\n1, 2022, with compliance required by May 1,   \n2022.

Many of our businesses, by their  \nnature, do not produce predictable earnings,  \nand all of our businesses are materially      \naffected by conditions in the global financial\nmarkets and economic conditions generally,    \nboth directly and through their impact on     \nclient activity levels and creditworthiness.  \nThese conditions can change suddenly and      \nnegatively. Our financial performance is      \nhighly dependent on the environment in which  \nour businesses operate. A favorable business  \nenvironment is generally characterized by,    \namong other factors, high global gross        \ndomestic product growth, regulatory and market\nconditions that result in transparent, liquid \nand efficient capital markets, low inflation, \nbusiness, consumer and investor confidence,   \nstable geopolitical conditions and strong     \nbusiness earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain   \neconomic and market conditions can be caused  \nby: low levels of or declines in economic     \ngrowth, business activity or investor,        \nbusiness or consumer confidence; changes in   \nconsumer spending or borrowing patterns;      \npandemics; limitations on the availability or \nincreases in the cost of credit and capital;  \nilliquid markets; increases in inflation,     \ninterest rates, exchange rate or basic        \ncommodity price volatility or default rates;  \nconcerns about sovereign defaults; uncertainty\nconcerning fiscal or monetary policy,         \ngovernment shutdowns, debt ceilings or        \nfunding; the extent of and uncertainty about  \npotential increases in tax rates and other    \nregulatory changes; limitations on            \ninternational trade and travel; laws and      \nregulations that limit trading in, or the     \nissuance of, securities of issuers outside    \ntheir domestic markets; outbreaks of domestic \nor international tensions or hostilities,     \nterrorism, nuclear proliferation, cyber       \nsecurity threats or attacks and other forms of\ndisruption to or curtailment of global        \ncommunication, energy transmission or         \ntransportation networks or other geopolitical \ninstability or uncertainty; corporate,        \npolitical or other scandals that reduce       \ninvestor confidence in capital markets;       \nextreme weather events or other natural       \ndisasters; or a combination of these or other \nfactors.                                      \n                                      \n  30    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe financial services industry and the       \nsecurities and other financial markets have   \nbeen materially and adversely affected in the \npast by significant declines in the values of \nnearly all asset classes, by a serious lack of\nliquidity and by high levels of borrower      \ndefaults. In addition, concerns about the     \nCOVID-19pandemic, European sovereign debt risk\nand its impact on the European banking system,\nlimitations on international trade, and       \npotential or actual changes in interest rates,\ninflation and other market conditions, have,  \nat times, negatively impacted the levels of   \nclient activity. General uncertainty about    \neconomic, political and market activities, and\nthe scope, timing and impact of regulatory    \nreform, as well as weak consumer, investor and\nCEO confidence resulting in large part from   \nsuch uncertainty, has in the past negatively  \nimpacted client activity, which can adversely \naffect many of our businesses. Periods of low \nvolatility and periods of high volatility     \ncombined with a lack of liquidity, have at    \ntimes had an unfavorable impact on our market-\nmaking businesses. Financial institution      \nreturns may be negatively impacted by         \nincreased funding costs due in part to the    \nlack of perceived government support of such  \ninstitutions in the event of future financial \ncrises relative to financial institutions in  \ncountries in which governmental support is    \nmaintained. In addition, liquidity in the     \nfinancial markets has also been negatively    \nimpacted as market participants and market    \npractices and structures continue to adjust to\nevolving regulatory frameworks. Our businesses\nhave been and may in the future be adversely  \naffected by declining asset values,           \nparticularly where we have net \u201clong\u201d         \npositions, receive fees based on the value of \nassets managed, or receive or post collateral.\nMany of our businesses have net \u201clong\u201d        \npositions in debt securities, loans,          \nderivatives, mortgages, equities (including   \nprivate equity and real estate) and most other\nasset classes. These include positions we take\nwhen we act as a principal to facilitate our  \nclients\u2019 activities, including our exchange-  \nbased market-making activities, or commit     \nlarge amounts of capital to maintain positions\nin interest rate and credit products, as well \nas through our currencies, commodities,       \nequities and mortgage-related activities. In  \naddition, we invest in similar asset classes. \nSubstantially all of our investing and market-\nmaking positions and a portion of our loans   \nare marked-to-marketon a daily or other       \nperiodic basis and declines in asset values   \ndirectly and promptly impact our earnings,    \nunless we have effectively \u201chedged\u201d our       \nexposures to those declines. In certain       \ncircumstances (particularly in the case of    \ncredit products, including leveraged loans,   \nand private equities or other securities that \nare not freely tradable or lack established   \nand liquid trading markets), it may not be    \npossible or economic to hedge our exposures   \nand to the extent that we do so the hedge may \nbe ineffective or may greatly reduce our      \nability to profit from increases in the values\nof the assets. Sudden declines and significant\nvolatility in the prices of assets have in the\npast and may in the future substantially      \ncurtail or eliminate the trading markets for  \ncertain assets, which may make it difficult to\nsell, hedge or value such assets. The         \ninability to sell or effectively hedge assets \nreduces our ability to limit losses in such   \npositions and the difficulty in valuing assets\nmay negatively affect our capital, liquidity  \nor leverage ratios, increase our funding costs\nand generally require us to maintain          \nadditional capital. In our exchange-based     \nmarket-making activities, we are obligated by \nstock exchange rules to maintain an orderly   \nmarket, including by purchasing securities in \na declining market. In markets where asset    \nvalues are declining and in volatile markets, \nthis results in losses and an increased need  \nfor liquidity. We receive asset-based         \nmanagement fees based on the value of our     \nclients\u2019 portfolios or investment in funds    \nmanaged by us and, in some cases, we also     \nreceive incentive fees based on increases in  \nthe value of such investments. Declines in    \nasset values would ordinarily reduce the value\nof our clients\u2019 portfolios or fund assets,    \nwhich in turn would typically reduce the fees \nwe earn for managing such assets.             \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    31  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe post collateral to support our obligations \nand receive collateral that supports the      \nobligations of our clients and counterparties.\nWhen the value of the assets posted as        \ncollateral or the credit ratings of the party \nposting collateral decline, the party posting \nthe collateral may need to provide additional \ncollateral or, if possible, reduce its trading\nposition. An example of such a situation is a \n\u201cmargin call\u201d in connection with a brokerage  \naccount. Therefore, declines in the value of  \nasset classes used as collateral mean that    \neither the cost of funding positions is       \nincreased or the size of positions is         \ndecreased. If we are the party providing      \ncollateral, this can increase our costs and   \nreduce our profitability and if we are the    \nparty receiving collateral, this can also     \nreduce our profitability by reducing the level\nof business done with our clients and         \ncounterparties. In addition, volatile or less \nliquid markets increase the difficulty of     \nvaluing assets, which can lead to costly and  \ntime-consuming disputes over asset values and \nthe level of required collateral, as well as  \nincreased credit risk to the recipient of the \ncollateral due to delays in receiving adequate\ncollateral. In cases where we foreclose on    \ncollateral, sudden declines in the value or   \nliquidity of the collateral has in the past   \nand may in the future, despite credit         \nmonitoring, over-collateralization, the       \nability to call for additional collateral or  \nthe ability to force repayment of the         \nunderlying obligation, result in significant  \nlosses to us, especially where there is a     \nsingle type of collateral supporting the      \nobligation. In addition, we have been and may \nin the future be subject to claims that the   \nforeclosure was not permitted under the legal \ndocuments, was conducted in an improper manner\nor caused a client or counterparty to go out  \nof business. Our market-making activities have\nbeen and may in the future be affected by     \nchanges in the levels of market volatility.   \nCertain of our market-making activities depend\non market volatility to provide trading and   \narbitrage opportunities to our clients, and   \ndecreases in volatility have reduced and may  \nin the future reduce these opportunities and  \nthe level of client activity associated with  \nthem and adversely affect the results of these\nactivities. Increased volatility, while it can\nincrease trading volumes and spreads, also    \nincreases risk as measured by Value-at-       \nRisk(VaR) and may expose us to increased risks\nin connection with our market-making          \nactivities or cause us to reduce our inventory\nin order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting\nthe size of our market-making positions can   \nadversely affect our profitability. In periods\nwhen volatility is increasing, but asset      \nvalues are declining significantly, it may not\nbe possible to sell assets at all or it may   \nonly be possible to do so at steep discounts. \nIn those circumstances we may be forced to    \neither take on additional risk or to realize  \nlosses in order to decrease our VaR. In       \naddition, increases in volatility increase the\nlevel of our RWAs, which increases our capital\nrequirements. Our investment banking, client  \nintermediation, asset management and wealth   \nmanagement businesses have been adversely     \naffected and may in the future be adversely   \naffected by market uncertainty or lack of     \nconfidence among investors and CEOs due to    \ndeclines in economic activity and other       \nunfavorable economic, geopolitical or market  \nconditions. Our investment banking business   \nhas been and may in the future be adversely   \naffected by market conditions. Poor economic  \nconditions and other uncertain geopolitical   \nconditions may adversely affect and have in   \nthe past adversely affected investor and CEO  \nconfidence, resulting in significant industry-\nwide declines in the size and number of       \nunderwritings and of financial advisory       \ntransactions, which would likely have an      \nadverse effect on our revenues and our profit \nmargins. In particular, because a significant \nportion of our investment banking revenues is \nderived from our participation in large       \ntransactions, a decline in the number of large\ntransactions has in the past and would in the \nfuture adversely affect our investment banking\nbusiness. Similarly, in recent years, cross-  \nborder initial public offerings and other     \nsecurities offerings have accounted for a     \nsignificant proportion of new issuance        \nactivity. Legislative, regulatory or other    \nchanges that limit trading in, or the issuance\nof, securities outside the issuers\u2019 domestic  \nmarkets have in the past and would in the     \nfuture adversely affect our underwriting      \nbusiness. In certain circumstances, market    \nuncertainty or general declines in market or  \neconomic activity may adversely affect our    \nclient intermediation businesses by decreasing\nlevels of overall activity or by decreasing   \nvolatility, but at other times market         \nuncertainty and even declining economic       \nactivity may result in higher trading volumes \nor higher spreads or both. Market uncertainty,\nvolatility and adverse economic conditions, as\nwell as declines in asset values, may cause   \nour clients to transfer their assets out of   \nour fundsor other products or their brokerage \naccounts and result in reduced net revenues,  \nprincipally in our asset management and wealth\nmanagement businesses. Even if clients do not \nwithdraw their funds, they may invest them in \nproducts that generate less fee income.       \n                                      \n  32    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur asset management and wealth management    \nbusinesses have been and may in the future be \nadversely affected by the poor investment     \nperformance of our investment products or a   \nclient preference for products other than     \nthose which we offer or for products that     \ngenerate lower fees. Poor investment returns  \nin our asset management and wealth management \nbusinesses, due to either general market      \nconditions or underperformance (relative to   \nour competitors or to benchmarks) by funds or \naccounts that we manage or investment products\nthat we design or sell, affects our ability to\nretain existing assets and to attract new     \nclients or additional assets from existing    \nclients. This could affect the management and \nincentive fees that we earn on AUS or the     \ncommissions and net spreads that we earn for  \nselling other investment products, such as    \nstructured notes or derivatives. To the extent\nthat our clients choose to invest in products \nthat we do not currently offer, we will suffer\noutflows and a loss of management fees.       \nFurther, if, due to changes in investor       \nsentiment or the relative performance of      \ncertain asset classes or otherwise, clients   \ncontinue to invest in products that generate  \nlower fees (e.g., passively managed or fixed  \nincome products), our average effective       \nmanagement fee would continue to decline and  \nour asset management and wealth management    \nbusinesses could be adversely affected.       \nLiquidity Our liquidity, profitability and    \nbusinesses may be adversely affected by an    \ninability to access the debt capital markets  \nor to sell assets. Liquidity is essential to  \nour businesses. It is of critical importance  \nto us, as most of the failures of financial   \ninstitutions have occurred in large part due  \nto insufficient liquidity. Our liquidity may  \nbe impaired by an inability to access secured \nand/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to\nraise or retain deposits, an inability to     \naccess funds from our subsidiaries or         \notherwise allocate liquidity optimally, an    \ninability to sell assets or redeem our        \ninvestments, lack of timely settlement of     \ntransactions, unusual deposit outflows, or    \nother unforeseen outflows of cash or          \ncollateral, such as in March 2020, when       \ncorporate clients drew on revolving credit    \nfacilities in response to the                 \nCOVID-19pandemic. This situation may arise due\nto circumstances that we may be unable to     \ncontrol, such as a general market or economic \ndisruption or an operational problem that     \naffects third parties or us, or even by the   \nperception among market participants that we, \nor other market participants, are experiencing\ngreater liquidity risk. We employ structured  \nproducts to benefit our clients and hedge our \nown risks. The financial instruments that we  \nhold and the contracts to which we are a party\nare often complex, and these complex          \nstructured products often do not have readily \navailable markets to access in times of       \nliquidity stress. Our investing and financing \nactivities may lead to situations where the   \nholdings from these activities represent a    \nsignificant portion of specific markets, which\ncould restrict liquidity for our positions.   \nFurther, our ability to sell assets may be    \nimpaired if there is not generally a liquid   \nmarket for such assets, as well as in         \ncircumstances where other market participants \nare seeking to sell similar otherwise         \ngenerally liquid assets at the same time, as  \nis likely to occur in a liquidity or other    \nmarket crisis or in response to changes to    \nrules or regulations. For example, recently an\ninvestment management firm with large         \npositions with several financial institutions \ndefaulted, resulting in rapidly declining     \nprices in the securities underlying those     \npositions. In addition, clearinghouses,       \nexchanges and other financial institutions    \nwith which we interact may exercise set-      \noffrights or the right to require additional  \ncollateral, including in difficult market     \nconditions, which could further impair our    \nliquidity. Regulatory changes relating to     \nliquidity may also negatively impact our      \nresults of operations and competitive         \nposition. Numerous regulations have been      \nadopted to introduce more stringent liquidity \nrequirements for large financial institutions.\nThese regulations address, among other        \nmatters, liquidity stress testing, minimum    \nliquidity requirements, wholesale funding,    \nlimitations on the issuance of short-term debt\nand structured notes, deductions for holdings \nof TLAC and prohibitions on parent guarantees \nthat are subject to certain cross-defaults.   \nNew and prospective liquidity-related         \nregulations may overlap with, and be impacted \nby, other regulatory changes, including rules \nrelating to minimum long-term debt            \nrequirements and TLAC, guidance on the        \ntreatment of brokered deposits and the        \ncapital, leverage and resolution and recovery \nframeworks applicable to large financial      \ninstitutions. Given the overlap and complex   \ninteractions among these new and prospective  \nregulations, they may have unintended         \ncumulative effects, and their full impact will\nremain uncertain, while regulatory reforms are\nbeing adopted and market practices develop. In\naddition, our need to manage our operations in\nlight of certain regulatory requirements when \napplicable thresholds are met has in the past \nlimited and may in the future limit our       \nability to raise deposits in GSIB or other    \nfunding, which could adversely affect our     \nliquidity or ability to respond efficiently to\nliquidity stress.                             \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    33  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur businesses have been and may in the future\nbe adversely affected by disruptions or lack  \nof liquidity in the credit markets, including \nreduced access to credit and higher costs of  \nobtaining credit. Widening credit spreads, as \nwell as significant declines in the           \navailability of credit, have in the past      \nadversely affected our ability to borrow on a \nsecured and unsecured basis and may do so in  \nthe future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured \nbasis by issuing long-term debt and commercial\npaper, by raising deposits at our bank        \nsubsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial     \ninstruments and by obtaining loans or lines of\ncredit from commercial or other banking       \nentities. We seek to finance many of our      \nassets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in \nthe credit markets may make it harder and more\nexpensive to obtain funding for our           \nbusinesses. If our available funding is       \nlimited or we are forced to fund our          \noperations at a higher cost, these conditions \nmay require us to curtail our business        \nactivities and increase our cost of funding,  \nboth of which could reduce our profitability, \nparticularly in our businesses that involve   \ninvesting, lending and market making. Our     \nclients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and \nother types of strategic transactions often   \nrely on access to the secured and unsecured   \ncredit markets to finance their transactions. \nA lack of available credit or an increased    \ncost of credit can adversely affect the size, \nvolume and timing of our clients\u2019 merger and  \nacquisition transactions, particularly large  \ntransactions, and adversely affect our        \nfinancial advisory and underwriting           \nbusinesses. Our credit businesses have been   \nand may in the future be negatively affected  \nby a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A   \nlack of liquidity reduces price transparency, \nincreases price volatility and decreases      \ntransaction volumes and size, all of which can\nincrease transaction risk or decrease the     \nprofitability of these businesses. Reductions \nin our credit ratings or an increase in our   \ncredit spreads may adversely affect our       \nliquidity and cost of funding. Our credit     \nratings are important to our liquidity. A     \nreduction in our credit ratings could         \nadversely affect our liquidity and competitive\nposition, increase our borrowing costs, limit \nour access to the capital markets or trigger  \nour obligations under certain provisions in   \nsome of our trading and collateralized        \nfinancing contracts. Under these provisions,  \ncounterparties could be permitted to terminate\ncontracts with us or require us to post       \nadditional collateral. Termination of our     \ntrading and collateralized financing contracts\ncould cause us to sustain losses and impair   \nour liquidity by requiring us to find other   \nsources of financing or to make significant   \ncash payments or securities movements. As of  \nDecember 2021, our counterparties could have  \ncalled for additional collateral or           \ntermination payments related to our net       \nderivative liabilities under bilateral        \nagreements in an aggregate amount of $345     \nmillion in the event of a one-notchdowngrade  \nof our credit ratings and $1.54 billion in the\nevent of a two-notchdowngrade of our credit   \nratings. A downgrade by any one rating agency,\ndepending on the agency\u2019s relative ratings of \nus at the time of the downgrade, may have an  \nimpact which is comparable to the impact of a \ndowngrade by all rating agencies.

Our cost of obtaining long-term    \nunsecured funding is directly related to our  \ncredit spreads (the amount in excess of the   \ninterest rate of benchmark securities that we \nneed to pay). Increases in our credit spreads \ncan significantly increase our cost of this   \nfunding. Changes in credit spreads are        \ncontinuous, market-driven, and subject at     \ntimes to unpredictable and highly volatile    \nmovements. Our credit spreads are also        \ninfluenced by market perceptions of our       \ncreditworthiness and movements in the costs to\npurchasers of credit default swaps referenced \nto our long-term debt. The market for credit  \ndefault swaps has proven to be extremely      \nvolatile and at times has lacked a high degree\nof transparency or liquidity.                 \n                                      \n  34    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGroup Inc. is a holding company and its       \nliquidity depends on payments and loans from  \nits subsidiaries, many of which are subject to\nlegal, regulatory and other restrictions on   \nproviding funds or assets to Group Inc. Group \nInc. is a holding company and, therefore,     \ndepends on dividends, distributions, loans and\nother payments from its subsidiaries to fund  \nshare repurchases and dividend payments and to\nfund payments on its obligations, including   \ndebt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries,   \nincluding our broker-dealer and bank          \nsubsidiaries, are subject to laws that        \nrestrict dividend payments or authorize       \nregulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow \nof funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc.\nIn addition, our broker-dealer and bank       \nsubsidiaries are subject to restrictions on   \ntheir ability to lend or transact with        \naffiliates and to minimum regulatory capital  \nand other requirements, as well as            \nrestrictions on their ability to use funds    \ndeposited with them in brokerage or bank      \naccounts to fund their businesses. Additional \nrestrictions on related-party transactions,   \nincreased capital and liquidity requirements  \nand additional limitations on the use of funds\non deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as  \nwell as lower earnings, can reduce the amount \nof funds available to meet the obligations of \nGroup Inc., including under the FRB\u2019s source  \nof strength requirement, and even require     \nGroup Inc. to provide additional funding to   \nsuch subsidiaries. Restrictions or regulatory \naction of that kind could impede access to    \nfunds that Group Inc. needs to make payments  \non its obligations, including debt            \nobligations, or dividend payments. In         \naddition, Group Inc.\u2019s right to participate in\na distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s  \nliquidation or reorganization is subject to   \nthe prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s          \ncreditors. There has been a trend towards     \nincreased regulation and supervision of our   \nsubsidiaries by the governments and regulators\nin the countries in which those subsidiaries  \nare located or do business. Concerns about    \nprotecting clients and creditors of financial \ninstitutions that are controlled by persons or\nentities located outside of the country in    \nwhich such entities are located or do business\nhave caused or may cause a number of          \ngovernments and regulators to take additional \nsteps to \u201cring fence\u201d or require internal     \ntotal loss-absorbing capacity (which may also \nbe subject to \u201cbail-in\u201dpowers, as described   \nbelow) at those entities in order to protect  \nclients and creditors of those entities in the\nevent of financial difficulties involving     \nthose entities. The result has been and may   \ncontinue to be additional limitations on our  \nability to efficiently move capital and       \nliquidity among our affiliated entities, or to\nGroup Inc., including in times of liquidity   \nstress, thereby increasing the overall level  \nof capital and liquidity required by us on a  \nconsolidated basis. Furthermore, Group Inc.   \nhas guaranteed the payment obligations of     \ncertain of its subsidiaries, including GS&Co. \nand GS Bank USA, subject to certain           \nexceptions. In addition, Group Inc. guarantees\nmany of the obligations of its other          \nconsolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-\ntransactionbasis, as negotiated with          \ncounterparties. These guarantees may require  \nGroup Inc. to provide substantial funds or    \nassets to its subsidiaries or their creditors \nor counterparties at a time when Group Inc. is\nin need of liquidity to fund its own          \nobligations. The requirements for us and      \ncertain of our subsidiaries to develop and    \nsubmit recovery and resolution plans to       \nregulators, and the incorporation of feedback \nreceived from regulators, may require us to   \nincrease capital or liquidity levels or issue \nadditional long-term debt at Group Inc. or    \nparticular subsidiaries or otherwise incur    \nadditional or duplicative operational or other\ncosts at multiple entities, and may reduce our\nability to provide Group Inc. guarantees of   \nthe obligations of our subsidiaries or raise  \ndebt at Group Inc. Resolution planning may    \nalso impair our ability to structure our      \nintercompany and external activities in a     \nmanner that we may otherwise deem most        \noperationally efficient. Furthermore,         \narrangements to facilitate our resolution     \nplanning may cause us to be subject to        \nadditional taxes. Any such limitations or     \nrequirements would be in addition to the legal\nand regulatory restrictions described above on\nour ability to engage in capital actions or   \nmake intercompany dividends or payments.

We are exposed to  \nthe risk that third parties that owe us money,\nsecurities or other assets will not perform   \ntheir obligations. These parties may default  \non their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, \nlack of liquidity, operational failure or     \nother reasons. A failure of a significant     \nmarket participant, or even concerns about a  \ndefault by such an institution, could lead to \nsignificant liquidity problems, losses or     \ndefaults by other institutions, which in turn \ncould adversely affect us. We are also subject\nto the risk that our rights against third     \nparties may not be enforceable in all         \ncircumstances. In addition, deterioration in  \nthe credit quality of third parties whose     \nsecurities or obligations we hold, including a\ndeterioration in the value of collateral      \nposted by third parties to secure their       \nobligations to us under derivative contracts  \nand loan agreements, could result in losses   \nand/or adversely affect our ability to        \nrehypothecate or otherwise use those          \nsecurities or obligations for liquidity       \npurposes. A significant downgrade in the      \ncredit ratings of our counterparties could    \nalso have a negative impact on our results.   \nWhile in many cases we are permitted to       \nrequire additional collateral from            \ncounterparties that experience financial      \ndifficulty, disputes may arise as to the      \namount of collateral we are entitled to       \nreceive and the value of pledged assets. The  \ntermination of contracts and the foreclosure  \non collateral may subject us to claims for the\nimproper exercise of our rights. Default      \nrates, downgrades and disputes with           \ncounterparties as to the valuation of         \ncollateral typically increase significantly in\ntimes of market stress, increased volatility  \nand illiquidity. As part of our clearing and  \nprime brokerage activities, we finance our    \nclients\u2019 positions, and we could be held      \nresponsible for the defaults or misconduct of \nour clients. Although we have limits and      \nregularly review credit exposures to specific \nclients and counterparties and to specific    \nindustries, countries and regions that we     \nbelieve may present credit concerns, default  \nrisk may arise from events or circumstances   \nthat are difficult to detect or foresee.      \nConcentration of risk increases the potential \nfor significant losses in our market-making,  \nunderwriting, investing and financing         \nactivities. Concentration of risk increases   \nthe potential for significant losses in our   \nmarket-making, underwriting, investing and    \nfinancing activities. The number and size of  \nthese transactions has affected and may in the\nfuture affect our results of operations in a  \ngiven period. Moreover, because of            \nconcentrated risk, we may suffer losses even  \nwhen economic and market conditions are       \ngenerally favorable for our competitors.      \nDisruptions in the credit markets can make it \ndifficult to hedge these credit exposures     \neffectively or economically. In addition, we  \nextend large commitments as part of our credit\norigination activities. Rules adopted under   \nthe Dodd-Frank Act, and similar rules adopted \nin other jurisdictions, require issuers of    \ncertain asset-backed securities and any person\nwho organizes and initiates certain asset-    \nbacked securities transactions to retain      \neconomic exposure to the asset, which has     \naffected the cost of and structures used in   \nconnection with these securitization          \nactivities. Our inability to reduce our credit\nrisk by selling, syndicating or securitizing  \nthese positions, including during periods of  \nmarket stress, could negatively affect our    \nresults of operations due to a decrease in the\nfair value of the positions, including due to \nthe insolvency or bankruptcy of borrowers, as \nwell as the loss of revenues associated with  \nselling such securities or loans. In the      \nordinary course of business, we may be subject\nto a concentration of credit risk to a        \nparticular counterparty, borrower, issuer     \n(including sovereign issuers) or geographic   \narea or group of related countries, such as   \nthe E.U., and a failure or downgrade of, or   \ndefault by, such entity could negatively      \nimpact our businesses, perhaps materially, and\nthe systems by which we set limits and monitor\nthe level of our credit exposure to individual\nentities, industries, countries and regions   \nmay not function as we have anticipated.      \nRegulatory reform, including the Dodd-Frank   \nAct, has led to increased centralization of   \ntrading activity through particular clearing  \nhouses, central agents or exchanges, which has\nsignificantly increased our concentration of  \nrisk with respect to these entities. While our\nactivities expose us to many different        \nindustries, counterparties and countries, we  \nroutinely execute a high volume of            \ntransactions with counterparties engaged in   \nfinancial services activities, including      \nbrokers and dealers, commercial banks,        \nclearing houses, exchanges and investment     \nfunds. This has resulted in significant credit\nconcentration with respect to these           \ncounterparties.                               \n                                      \n  36    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDerivative transactions and delayed           \ndocumentation or settlements may expose us to \ncredit risk, unexpected risks and potential   \nlosses. We are party to a large number of     \nderivative transactions, including credit     \nderivatives. Many of these derivative         \ninstruments are individually negotiated and   \nnon-standardized,which can make exiting,      \ntransferring or settling positions difficult. \nMany credit derivatives require that we       \ndeliver to the counterparty the underlying    \nsecurity, loan or other obligation in order to\nreceive payment. In a number of cases, we do  \nnot hold the underlying security, loan or     \nother obligation and may not be able to obtain\nthe underlying security, loan or other        \nobligation. This could cause us to forfeit the\npayments due to us under these contracts or   \nresult in settlement delays with the attendant\ncredit and operational risk, as well as       \nincreased costs to us. Derivative transactions\nmay also involve the risk that documentation  \nhas not been properly executed, that executed \nagreements may not be enforceable against the \ncounterparty, or that obligations under such  \nagreements may not be able to be \u201cnetted\u201d     \nagainst other obligations with such           \ncounterparty. In addition, counterparties may \nclaim that such transactions were not         \nappropriate or authorized. As a signatory to  \nthe ISDA Universal Protocol or U.S. ISDA      \nProtocol (ISDA Protocols) and being subject to\nthe FRB\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s rules on QFCs and similar\nrules in other jurisdictions, we may not be   \nable to exercise remedies against             \ncounterparties and, as this new regime has not\nyet been tested, we may suffer risks or losses\nthat we would not have expected to suffer if  \nwe could immediately close out transactions   \nupon a termination event. The ISDA Protocols  \nand these rules and regulations extend to     \nrepurchase agreements and other instruments   \nthat are not derivative contracts. Derivative \ncontracts and other transactions, including   \nsecondary bank loan purchases and sales,      \nentered into with third parties are not always\nconfirmed by the counterparties or settled on \na timely basis. While the transaction remains \nunconfirmed or during any delay in settlement,\nwe are subject to heightened credit and       \noperational risk and in the event of a default\nmay find it more difficult to enforce our     \nrights. In addition, as new complex derivative\nproducts are created, covering a wider array  \nof underlying credit and other instruments,   \ndisputes about the terms of the underlying    \ncontracts could arise, which could impair our \nability to effectively manage our risk        \nexposures from these products and subject us  \nto increased costs. The provisions of the     \nDodd-Frank Act requiring central clearing of  \ncredit derivatives and other OTC derivatives, \nor a market shift toward standardized         \nderivatives, could reduce the risk associated \nwith these transactions, but under certain    \ncircumstances could also limit our ability to \ndevelop derivatives that best suit the needs  \nof our clients and to hedge our own risks, and\ncould adversely affect our profitability and  \nhas increased our credit exposure to central  \nclearing platforms. Operational A failure in  \nour operational systems or infrastructure, or \nthose of third parties, as well as human      \nerror, malfeasance or other misconduct, could \nimpair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, \nresult in the disclosure of confidential      \ninformation, damage our reputation and cause  \nlosses. Our businesses are highly dependent on\nour ability to process and monitor, on a daily\nbasis, a very large number of transactions,   \nmany of which are highly complex and occur at \nhigh volumes and frequencies, across numerous \nand diverse markets in many currencies. These \ntransactions, as well as the information      \ntechnology services we provide to clients,    \noften must adhere to client-specific          \nguidelines, as well as legal and regulatory   \nstandards. Many rules and regulations         \nworldwide govern our obligations to execute   \ntransactions and report such transactions and \nother information to regulators, exchanges and\ninvestors. Compliance with these legal and    \nreporting requirements can be challenging, and\nwe have been and may in the future be subject \nto regulatory fines and penalties for failing \nto follow these rules or to report timely,    \naccurate and complete information in          \naccordance with these rules. As such          \nrequirements expand, compliance with these    \nrules and regulations has become more         \nchallenging.                                  \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    37  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAs our client base, including through our     \nconsumer businesses, and our geographical     \nreach expand and the volume, speed, frequency \nand complexity of transactions, especially    \nelectronic transactions (as well as the       \nrequirements to report such transactions on a \nreal-time basis to clients, regulators and    \nexchanges) increase, developing and           \nmaintaining our operational systems and       \ninfrastructure becomes more challenging, and  \nthe risk of systems or human error in         \nconnection with such transactions increases,  \nas well as the potential consequences of such \nerrors due to the speed and volume of         \ntransactions involved and the potential       \ndifficulty associated with discovering errors \nquickly enough to limit the resulting         \nconsequences. Such risks are exacerbated in   \ntimes of increased volatility. As with other  \nsimilarly situated institutions, we utilize   \ncredit underwriting models in connection with \nour businesses, including our consumer-       \noriented activities. Allegations, whether or  \nnot accurate, that the ultimate underwriting  \ndecisions do not treat consumers or clients   \nfairly, or comply with the applicable law or  \nregulation, can result in negative publicity, \nreputational damage and governmental and      \nregulatory scrutiny, investigations and       \nenforcement actions. Our financial,           \naccounting, data processing or other          \noperational systems and facilities may fail to\noperate properly or become disabled as a      \nresult of events that are wholly or partially \nbeyond our control, such as a spike in        \ntransaction volume, adversely affecting our   \nability to process these transactions or      \nprovide these services. We must continuously  \nupdate these systems to support our operations\nand growth and to respond to changes in       \nregulations and markets, and invest heavily in\nsystemic controls and training to pursue our  \nobjective of ensuring that such transactions  \ndo not violate applicable rules and           \nregulations or, due to errors in processing   \nsuch transactions, adversely affect markets,  \nour clients and counterparties or us.         \nEnhancements and updates to systems, as well  \nas the requisite training, including in       \nconnection with the integration of new        \nbusinesses, entail significant costs and      \ncreate risks associated with implementing new \nsystems and integrating them with existing    \nones. The use of computing devices and phones \nis critical to the work done by our employees \nand the operation of our systems and          \nbusinesses and those of our clients and our   \nthird-party service providers and vendors.    \nTheir importance has continued to increase, in\nparticular in light of work-from-home         \narrangements implemented in response to the   \nCOVID-19pandemic. Computers and computer      \nnetworks are subject to various risks,        \nincluding, among others, cyber attacks,       \ninherent technological defects, system        \nfailures and human error. For example,        \nfundamental security flaws in computer chips  \nfound in many types of these computing devices\nand phones have been reported in the past and \nmay be discovered in the future. Cloud        \ntechnologies are also critical to the         \noperation of our systems and platforms and our\nreliance on cloud technologies is growing.    \nService disruptions have resulted, and may    \nresult in the future, in delays in accessing, \nor the loss of, data that is important to our \nbusinesses and may hinder our clients\u2019 access \nto our platforms. During 2021, there were a   \nnumber of widely publicized cases of outages  \nin connection with access to cloud computing  \nproviders. Addressing these and similar issues\ncould be costly and affect the performance of \nthese businesses and systems. Operational     \nrisks may be incurred in applying fixes and   \nthere may still be residual security risks.   \nAdditionally, although the prevalence and     \nscope of applications of distributed ledger   \ntechnology and similar technologies is        \ngrowing, the technology is also nascent and   \nmay be vulnerable to cyber attacks or have    \nother inherent weaknesses. We are exposed to  \nrisks, and may become exposed to additional   \nrisks, related to distributed ledger          \ntechnology, including through our facilitation\nof clients\u2019 activities involving financial    \nproducts that use distributed ledger          \ntechnology, such as blockchain or             \ncryptocurrencies, our investments in companies\nthat seek to develop platforms based on       \ndistributed ledger technology, the use of     \ndistributed ledger technology by third-party  \nvendors, clients, counterparties, clearing    \nhouses and other financial intermediaries, and\nthe receipt of cryptocurrencies or other      \ndigital assets as collateral.                 \n                                      \n  38    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of          \ntechnology and technology-based risk and      \ncontrol systems, our businesses ultimately    \nrely on people as our greatest resource, and, \nfrom time to time, they have in the past and  \nmay in the future make mistakes or engage in  \nviolations of applicable policies, laws, rules\nor procedures that are not always caught      \nimmediately by our technological processes or \nby our controls and other procedures, which   \nare intended to prevent and detect such errors\nor violations. These have in the past and may \nin the future include calculation errors,     \nmistakes in addressing emails, errors in      \nsoftware or model development or              \nimplementation, or simple errors in judgment, \nas well as intentional efforts to ignore or   \ncircumvent applicable policies, laws, rules or\nprocedures. Human errors, malfeasance and     \nother misconduct, including the intentional   \nmisuse of client information in connection    \nwith insider trading or for other purposes,   \neven if promptly discovered and remediated,   \nhas in the past and may in the future result  \nin reputational damage and losses and         \nliabilities for us. In addition, we face the  \nrisk of operational failure or significant    \noperational delay, termination or capacity    \nconstraints of any of the clearing agents,    \nexchanges, clearing houses or other financial \nintermediaries we use to facilitate our       \nsecurities and derivatives transactions, and  \nas our interconnectivity with our clients     \ngrows, we increasingly face the risk of       \noperational failure or significant operational\ndelay with respect to our clients\u2019 systems.   \nThere has been significant consolidation among\nclearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses\nand an increasing number of derivative        \ntransactions are cleared on exchanges, which  \nhas increased our exposure to operational     \nfailure or significant operational delay,     \ntermination or capacity constraints of the    \nparticular financial intermediaries that we   \nuse and could affect our ability to find      \nadequate and cost-effective alternatives in   \nthe event of any such failure, delay,         \ntermination or constraint. Industry           \nconsolidation, whether among market           \nparticipants or financial intermediaries,     \nincreases the risk of operational failure or  \nsignificant operational delay as disparate    \ncomplex systems need to be integrated, often  \non an accelerated basis. The interconnectivity\nof multiple financial institutions with       \ncentral agents, exchanges and clearing houses,\nand the increased centrality of these         \nentities, increases the risk that an          \noperational failure at one institution or     \nentity may cause an industry-wide operational \nfailure that could materially impact our      \nability to conduct business. Interconnectivity\nof financial institutions with other companies\nthrough, among other things, application      \nprogramming interfaces or APIs presents       \nsimilar risks. Any such failure, termination  \nor constraint could adversely affect our      \nability to effect transactions, service our   \nclients, manage our exposure to risk or expand\nour businesses or result in financial loss or \nliability to our clients, impairment of our   \nliquidity, disruption of our businesses,      \nregulatory intervention or reputational       \ndamage. Despite our resiliency plans and      \nfacilities, our ability to conduct business   \nmay be adversely impacted by a disruption in  \nthe infrastructure that supports our          \nbusinesses and the communities where we are   \nlocated. This may include a disruption        \ninvolving electrical, satellite, undersea     \ncable or other communications, internet,      \ntransportation or other facilities used by us,\nour employees or third parties with which we  \nconduct business, including cloud service     \nproviders. These disruptions may occur as a   \nresult of events that affect only our         \nbuildings or systems or those of such third   \nparties, or as a result of events with a      \nbroader impact globally, regionally or in the \ncities where those buildings or systems are   \nlocated, including, but not limited to,       \nnatural disasters, war, civil unrest,         \nterrorism, economic or political developments,\npandemics and weather events. In addition,    \nalthough we seek to diversify our third-party \nvendors to increase our resiliency, we are    \nalso exposed to the risk that a disruption or \nother information technology event at a common\nservice provider to our vendors could impede  \ntheir ability to provide products or services \nto us, including in connection with our new   \nbusiness initiatives.

A failure to     \nprotect our computer systems, networks and    \ninformation, and our clients\u2019 information,    \nagainst cyber attacks and similar threats     \ncould impair our ability to conduct our       \nbusinesses, result in the disclosure, theft or\ndestruction of confidential information,      \ndamage our reputation and cause losses. Our   \noperations rely on the secure processing,     \nstorage and transmission of confidential and  \nother information in our computer systems and \nnetworks and those of our vendors. There have \nbeen a number of highly publicized cases      \ninvolving financial services companies,       \nconsumer-based companies, software and        \ninformation technology service providers,     \ngovernmental agencies and other organizations \nreporting the unauthorized access or          \ndisclosure of client, customer or other       \nconfidential information in recent years, as  \nwell as cyber attacks involving the           \ndissemination, theft and destruction of       \ncorporate information or other assets, as a   \nresult of failure to follow procedures by     \nemployees or contractors or as a result of    \nactions by third parties, including actions by\nforeign governments. There have also been     \nseveral highly publicized cases where hackers \nhave requested \u201cransom\u201d payments in exchange  \nfor not disclosing customer information or for\nrestoring access to information or systems. We\nare regularly the target of attempted cyber   \nattacks, including denial-of-serviceattacks,  \nand must continuously monitor and develop our \nsystems to protect the integrity and          \nfunctionality of our technology infrastructure\nand access to and the security of our data. We\nhave faced an increasing number of attempted  \ncyber attacks as we expand our mobile- and    \nother internet-based products and services, as\nwell as our usage of mobile and cloud         \ntechnologies, and as we provide more of these \nservices to a greater number of individual    \nconsumers. The increasing migration of our    \ncommunication from devices we provide to      \nemployee-owned devices presents additional    \nrisks of cyber attacks, as do work-from-home  \narrangements such as those implemented in     \nresponse to the COVID-19pandemic. In addition,\ndue to our interconnectivity with third-party \nvendors (and their respective service         \nproviders), central agents, exchanges,        \nclearing houses and other financial           \ninstitutions, we could be adversely impacted  \nif any of them is subject to a successful     \ncyber attack or other information security    \nevent. These impacts could include the loss of\naccess to information or services from the    \nthird party subject to the cyber attack or    \nother information security event, which could,\nin turn, interrupt certain of our businesses. \nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of\nour systems and information, we may not be    \nable to anticipate, detect or implement       \neffective preventive measures against all     \ncyber threats, especially because the         \ntechniques used are increasingly              \nsophisticated, change frequently and are often\nnot recognized until launched. Cyber attacks  \ncan originate from a variety of sources,      \nincluding third parties who are affiliated    \nwith or sponsored by foreign governments or   \nare involved with organized crime or terrorist\norganizations. Third parties may also attempt \nto place individuals in our offices or induce \nemployees, clients or other users of our      \nsystems to disclose sensitive information or  \nprovide access to our data or that of our     \nclients, and these types of risks may be      \ndifficult to detect or prevent. Although we   \ntake protective measures proactively and      \nendeavor to modify them as circumstances      \nwarrant, our computer systems, software and   \nnetworks may be vulnerable to unauthorized    \naccess, misuse, computer viruses or other     \nmalicious code, cyber attacks on our vendors  \nand other events that could have a security   \nimpact. Risks relating to cyber attacks on our\nvendors have been increasing given the greater\nfrequency and severity in recent years of     \nsupply chain attacks affecting software and   \ninformation technology service providers. Due \nto the complexity and interconnectedness of   \nour systems, the process of enhancing our     \nprotective measures can itself create a risk  \nof systems disruptions and security issues. In\naddition, protective measures that we employ  \nto compartmentalize our data may reduce our   \nvisibility into, and adversely affect our     \nability to respond to, cyber threats and      \nissues with our systems.                      \n                                      \n  40    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIf one or more of such events occur, this     \npotentially could jeopardize our or our       \nclients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential and  \nother information processed, stored in, or    \ntransmitted through our computer systems and  \nnetworks, or otherwise cause interruptions or \nmalfunctions in our operations or those of our\nclients, counterparties or third parties,     \nwhich could impact their ability to transact  \nwith us or otherwise result in legal or       \nregulatory action, significant losses or      \nreputational damage. In addition, such an     \nevent could persist for an extended period of \ntime before being detected, and, following    \ndetection, it could take considerable time for\nus to obtain full and reliable information    \nabout the extent, amount and type of          \ninformation compromised. During the course of \nan investigation, we may not know the full    \nimpact of the event and how to remediate it,  \nand actions, decisions and mistakes that are  \ntaken or made may further increase the        \nnegative effects of the event on our business,\nresults of operations and reputation. We have \nexpended, and expect to continue to expend,   \nsignificant resources on an ongoing basis to  \nmodify our protective measures and to         \ninvestigate and remediate vulnerabilities or  \nother exposures, but these measures may be    \nineffective and we may be subject to legal or \nregulatory action, as well as financial losses\nthat are either not insured against or not    \nfully covered through any insurance maintained\nby us. Our clients\u2019 confidential information  \nmay also be at risk from the compromise of    \nclients\u2019 personal electronic devices or as a  \nresult of a data security breach at an        \nunrelated company. Losses due to unauthorized \naccount activity could harm our reputation and\nmay have adverse effects on our business,     \nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nThe increased use of mobile and cloud         \ntechnologies can heighten these and other     \noperational risks, as can work-from-home      \narrangements. Certain aspects of the security \nof such technologies are unpredictable or     \nbeyond our control, and the failure by mobile \ntechnology and cloud service providers to     \nadequately safeguard their systems and prevent\ncyber attacks could disrupt our operations and\nresult in misappropriation, corruption or loss\nof confidential and other information. In     \naddition, there is a risk that encryption and \nother protective measures, despite their      \nsophistication, may be defeated, particularly \nto the extent that new computing technologies \nvastly increase the speed and computing power \navailable. We routinely transmit and receive  \npersonal, confidential and proprietary        \ninformation by email and other electronic     \nmeans. We have discussed and worked with      \nclients, vendors, service providers,          \ncounterparties and other third parties to     \ndevelop secure transmission capabilities and  \nprotect against cyber attacks, but we do not  \nhave, and may be unable to put in place,      \nsecure capabilities with all of our clients,  \nvendors, service providers, counterparties and\nother third parties and we may not be able to \nensure that these third parties have          \nappropriate controls in place to protect the  \nconfidentiality of the information. An        \ninterception, misuse or mishandling of        \npersonal, confidential or proprietary         \ninformation being sent to or received from a  \nclient, vendor, service provider, counterparty\nor other third party could result in legal    \nliability, regulatory action and reputational \nharm. We may incur losses as a result of      \nineffective risk management processes and     \nstrategies. We seek to monitor and control our\nrisk exposure through a risk and control      \nframework encompassing a variety of separate  \nbut complementary financial, credit,          \noperational, compliance and legal reporting   \nsystems, internal controls, management review \nprocesses and other mechanisms. Our risk      \nmanagement process seeks to balance our       \nability to profit from market-making,         \ninvesting or lending positions, and           \nunderwriting activities, with our exposure to \npotential losses. While we employ a broad and \ndiversified set of risk monitoring and risk   \nmitigation techniques, those techniques and   \nthe judgments that accompany their application\ncannot anticipate every economic and financial\noutcome or the specifics and timing of such   \noutcomes. Thus, in the course of our          \nactivities, we have incurred and may in the   \nfuture incur losses. Market conditions in     \nrecent years have involved unprecedented      \ndislocations and highlight the limitations    \ninherent in using historical data to manage   \nrisk. The models that we use to assess and    \ncontrol our risk exposures reflect assumptions\nabout the degrees of correlation or lack      \nthereof among prices of various asset classes \nor other market indicators. In times of market\nstress or other unforeseen circumstances,     \npreviously uncorrelated indicators may become \ncorrelated, or conversely previously          \ncorrelated indicators may move in different   \ndirections. These types of market movements   \nhave at times limited the effectiveness of our\nhedging strategies and have caused us to incur\nsignificant losses, and they may do so in the \nfuture. These changes in correlation have been\nand may in the future be exacerbated where    \nother market participants are using risk or   \ntrading models with assumptions or algorithms \nthat are similar to ours. In these and other  \ncases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk \npositions due to the activity of other market \nparticipants or widespread market             \ndislocations, including circumstances where   \nasset values are declining significantly or no\nmarket exists for certain assets.             \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    41  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, the use of models in connection  \nwith risk management and numerous other       \ncritical activities presents risks that such  \nmodels may be ineffective, either because of  \npoor design, ineffective testing, or improper \nor flawed inputs, as well as unpermitted      \naccess to such models resulting in unapproved \nor malicious changes to the model or its      \ninputs. To the extent that we have positions  \nthrough our market-making or origination      \nactivities or we make investments directly    \nthrough our investing activities, including   \nprivate equity, that do not have an           \nestablished liquid trading market or are      \notherwise subject to restrictions on sale or  \nhedging, we may not be able to reduce our     \npositions and therefore reduce our risk       \nassociated with those positions. In addition, \nto the extent permitted by applicable law and \nregulation, we invest our own capital in      \nprivate equity, credit, real estate and hedge \nfunds that we manage and limitations on our   \nability to withdraw some or all of our        \ninvestments in these funds, whether for legal,\nreputational or other reasons, may make it    \nmore difficult for us to control the risk     \nexposures relating to these investments.      \nPrudent risk management, as well as regulatory\nrestrictions, may cause us to limit our       \nexposure to counterparties, geographic areas  \nor markets, which may limit our business      \nopportunities and increase the cost of our    \nfunding or hedging activities. As we have     \nexpanded and intend to continue to expand the \nproduct and geographic scope of our offerings \nof credit products to consumers, we are       \npresented with different credit risks and must\nexpand and adapt our credit risk monitoring   \nand mitigation activities to account for these\nbusiness activities. A failure to adequately  \nassess and control such risk exposures could  \nresult in losses to us. For further           \ninformation about our risk management policies\nand procedures, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion  \nand Analysis of Financial Condition and       \nResults of Operations \u2014 Risk Management\u201d in   \nPart II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. We may     \nincur losses as a result of unforeseen or     \ncatastrophic events, including pandemics,     \nterrorist attacks, extreme weather events or  \nother natural disasters. The occurrence of    \nunforeseen or catastrophic events, including  \npandemics, such as COVID-19,or other          \nwidespread health emergencies (or concerns    \nover the possibility of such an emergency),   \nterrorist attacks, extreme weather events,    \nsolar events or other natural disasters, could\ncreate economic and financial disruptions, and\ncould lead to operational difficulties        \n(including travel limitations and limitations \non occupancy in our offices) that could impair\nour ability to manage our businesses. Climate \nchange could disrupt our businesses and       \nadversely affect client activity levels and   \nthe creditworthiness of our clients and       \ncounterparties, and our efforts to address    \nconcerns relating to climate change could     \nresult in damage to our reputation. Climate   \nchange may cause extreme weather events that  \ndisrupt operations at one or more of our      \nprimary locations, which may negatively affect\nour ability to service and interact with our  \nclients, adversely affect the value of our    \ninvestments, including our real estate        \ninvestments, and reduce the availability or   \nincrease the cost of insurance. Climate change\nand the transition to a less carbon-dependent \neconomy may also have a negative impact on the\noperations or financial condition of our      \nclients and counterparties, which may decrease\nrevenues from those clients and counterparties\nand increase the credit risk associated with  \nloans and other credit exposures to those     \nclients and counterparties. In addition,      \nclimate change may impact the broader economy.\nWe are also exposed to risks resulting from   \nchanges in public policy, laws and            \nregulations, or market and public perceptions \nand preferences in connection with the        \ntransition to a less carbon-dependent economy.\nThese changes could adversely affect our      \nbusiness, results of operations and           \nreputation. For example, our reputation and   \nclient relationships may be damaged as a      \nresult of our involvement, or our clients\u2019    \ninvolvement, in certain industries or projects\nassociated with causing or exacerbating       \nclimate change, as well as any decisions we   \nmake to continue to conduct or change our     \nactivities in response to considerations      \nrelating to climate change. If we are unable  \nto achieve our objectives relating to climate \nchange or our response to climate change is   \nperceived to be ineffective or insufficient,  \nour business, reputation and efforts to       \nrecruit and retain employees may suffer.      \n                                      \n  42    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNew regulations or guidance relating to       \nclimate change, as well as the perspectives of\nregulators, shareholders, employees and other \nstakeholders regarding climate change, may    \naffect whether and on what terms and          \nconditions we engage in certain activities or \noffer certain products. Federal and state, and\nnon-U.S.banking regulators and supervisory    \nauthorities, shareholders and other           \nstakeholders have increasingly viewed         \nfinancial institutions as playing an important\nrole in helping to address risks related to   \nclimate change, both directly and with respect\nto their clients, which may result in         \nfinancial institutions coming under increased \nrequirements and expectations regarding the   \ndisclosure and management of their climate    \nrisks and related lending, investment and     \nadvisory activities. We also may become       \nsubject to new or heightened regulatory       \nrequirements relating to climate change, such \nas requirements relating to operational       \nresiliency or stress testing for various      \nclimate stress scenarios. Any such new or     \nheightened requirements could result in       \nincreased regulatory, compliance or other     \ncosts or higher capital requirements. The     \nrisks associated with, and the perspective of \nregulators, shareholders, employees and other \nstakeholders regarding, climate change are    \ncontinuing to evolve rapidly, which can make  \nit difficult to assess the ultimate impact on \nus of climate change-related risks and        \nuncertainties, and we expect that climate     \nchange-related risks will increase over time. \nLegal and Regulatory Our businesses and those \nof our clients are subject to extensive and   \npervasive regulation around the world. As a   \nparticipant in the financial services industry\nand a systemically important financial        \ninstitution, we are subject to extensive      \nregulation in jurisdictions around the world. \nWe face the risk of significant intervention  \nby law enforcement, regulatory and taxing     \nauthorities, as well as private litigation, in\nall jurisdictions in which we conduct our     \nbusinesses. In many cases, our activities have\nbeen and may continue to be subject to        \noverlapping and divergent regulation in       \ndifferent jurisdictions. Among other things,  \nas a result of law enforcement authorities,   \nregulators or private parties challenging our \ncompliance with existing laws and regulations,\nwe or our employees have been, and could be,  \nfined, criminally charged or sanctioned;      \nprohibited from engaging in some of our       \nbusiness activities; subjected to limitations \nor conditions on our business activities,     \nincluding higher capital requirements; or     \nsubjected to new or substantially higher taxes\nor other governmental charges in connection   \nwith the conduct of our businesses or with    \nrespect to our employees. These limitations or\nconditions may limit our business activities  \nand negatively impact our profitability. In   \naddition to the impact on the scope and       \nprofitability of our business activities, day-\nto-daycompliance with existing laws and       \nregulations has involved and will continue to \ninvolve significant amounts of time, including\nthat of our senior leaders and that of a large\nnumber of dedicated compliance and other      \nreporting and operational personnel, all of   \nwhich may negatively impact our profitability.\nOur revenues and profitability and those of   \nour competitors have been and will continue to\nbe impacted by requirements relating to       \ncapital, additional loss-absorbing capacity,  \nleverage, minimum liquidity and long-term     \nfunding levels, requirements related to       \nresolution and recovery planning, derivatives \nclearing and margin rules and levels of       \nregulatory oversight, as well as limitations  \non which and, if permitted, how certain       \nbusiness activities may be carried out by     \nfinancial institutions. The laws and          \nregulations that apply to our businesses are  \noften complex and, in many cases, we must make\ninterpretive decisions regarding the          \napplication of those laws and regulations to  \nour business activities. Changes in           \ninterpretations, whether in response to       \nregulatory guidance, industry conventions, our\nown reassessments or otherwise, could         \nadversely affect our businesses, results of   \noperations or ability to satisfy applicable   \nregulatory requirements, such as capital or   \nliquidity requirements. If there are new laws \nor regulations or changes in the              \ninterpretation or enforcement of existing laws\nor regulations applicable to our businesses or\nthose of our clients, including capital,      \nliquidity, leverage, long-term debt, total    \nloss-absorbing capacity and margin            \nrequirements, restrictions on leveraged       \nlending or other business practices, reporting\nrequirements, requirements relating to        \nrecovery and resolution planning, tax burdens \nand compensation restrictions, that are       \nimposed on a limited subset of financial      \ninstitutions (whether based on size, method of\nfunding, activities, geography or other       \ncriteria), compliance with these new laws or  \nregulations, or changes in the enforcement of \nexisting laws or regulations, could adversely \naffect our ability to compete effectively with\nother institutions that are not affected in   \nthe same way. In addition, regulation imposed \non financial institutions or market           \nparticipants generally, such as taxes on stock\ntransfers and other financial transactions,   \ncould adversely impact levels of market       \nactivity more broadly, and thus impact our    \nbusinesses. Changes to laws or regulations,   \nsuch as tax laws, could also have a           \ndisproportionate impact on us, based on the   \nway those laws or regulations are applied to  \nfinancial services and financial firms or due \nto our corporate structure.                   \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    43  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThese developments could impact our           \nprofitability in the affected jurisdictions,  \nor even make it uneconomic for us to continue \nto conduct all or certain of our businesses in\nthose jurisdictions, or could cause us to     \nincur significant costs associated with       \nchanging our business practices, restructuring\nour businesses, moving all or certain of our  \nbusinesses and our employees to other         \nlocations or complying with applicable capital\nrequirements, including reducing dividends or \nshare repurchases, liquidating assets or      \nraising capital in a manner that adversely    \nincreases our funding costs or otherwise      \nadversely affects our shareholders and        \ncreditors. U.S. and non-U.S.regulatory        \ndevelopments, in particular the Dodd-Frank Act\nand Basel III, have significantly altered the \nregulatory framework within which we operate  \nand have adversely affected and may in the    \nfuture adversely affect our profitability.    \nAmong the aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that  \nhave affected or may in the future affect our \nbusinesses are: increased capital, liquidity  \nand reporting requirements; limitations on    \nactivities in which we may engage; increased  \nregulation of and restrictions on OTC         \nderivatives markets and transactions;         \nlimitations on incentive compensation;        \nlimitations on affiliate transactions;        \nrequirements to reorganize or limit activities\nin connection with recovery and resolution    \nplanning; increased deposit insurance         \nassessments; and increased standards of care  \nfor broker-dealers and investment advisers in \ndealing with clients. The implementation of   \nhigher capital requirements, more stringent   \nrequirements relating to liquidity, long-term \ndebt and total loss-absorbing capacity and the\nprohibition on proprietary trading and the    \nsponsorship of, or investment in, covered     \nfunds by the Volcker Rule may continue to     \nadversely affect our profitability and        \ncompetitive position, particularly if these   \nrequirements do not apply equally to our      \ncompetitors or are not implemented uniformly  \nacross jurisdictions. We may also become      \nsubject to higher and more stringent capital  \nand other regulatory requirements as a result \nof the implementation of Basel Committee      \nstandards, including the new credit and       \noperational risk capital standards published  \nin December 2017 and the new market risk      \ncapital standard published in January 2019. As\ndescribed in \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation \u2014 Banking \nSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 \nof this Form 10-K,the SCB has replaced the    \ncapital conservation buffer under the         \nStandardized Capital Rules and resulted in    \nhigher Standardized capital ratio             \nrequirements. Failure to comply with these    \nrequirements could limit our ability to, among\nother things, repurchase shares, pay dividends\nand make certain discretionary compensation   \npayments. In addition, if, as in 2020, we are \nrequired to resubmit our capital plan, we     \ngenerally may not make capital distributions, \nsuch as share repurchases or dividends,       \nwithout the prior approval of the FRB.        \nDividends and repurchases are also subject to \noversight by the FRB, which can result in     \nlimitations. Limitations on our ability to    \nmake capital distributions could, among other \nthings, prevent us from returning capital to  \nour shareholders and impact our return on     \nequity. Additionally, as a G-SIB,we are       \nsubject to the G-SIBsurcharge. Our            \nG-SIBsurcharge is updated annually based on   \nfinancial data from the prior year. Expansion \nof our businesses, growth in our balance sheet\nand increased reliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding have resulted in increases and in the \nfuture may result in further increases in our \nG-SIBsurcharge and a corresponding increase in\nour capital requirements. We are also subject \nto laws and regulations, such as the GDPR and \nthe California Consumer Privacy Act, relating \nto the privacy of the information of clients, \nemployees or others, and any failure to comply\nwith these laws and regulations could expose  \nus to liability and/or reputational damage. As\nnew privacy-related laws and regulations are  \nimplemented, the time and resources needed for\nus to comply with such laws and regulations,  \nas well as our potential liability for non-   \ncomplianceand reporting obligations in the    \ncase of data breaches, may significantly      \nincrease. In addition, our businesses are     \nincreasingly subject to laws and regulations  \nrelating to surveillance, encryption and data \non-shoringin the jurisdictions in which we    \noperate. Compliance with these laws and       \nregulations may require us to change our      \npolicies, procedures and technology for       \ninformation security, which could, among other\nthings, make us more vulnerable to cyber      \nattacks and misappropriation, corruption or   \nloss of information or technology.            \n                                      \n  44    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Not only are these regulations       \nextensive, but they involve types of          \nregulations and supervision, as well as       \nregulatory compliance risks, that have not    \nhistorically applied to us. The level of      \nregulatory scrutiny and the scope of          \nregulations affecting financial interactions  \nwith consumers is often much greater than that\nassociated with doing business with           \ninstitutions and high-net-worthindividuals.   \nComplying with these regulations is time-     \nconsuming, costly and presents new and        \nincreased risks. Increasingly, regulators and \ncourts have sought to hold financial          \ninstitutions liable for the misconduct of     \ntheir clients where they have determined that \nthe financial institution should have detected\nthat the client was engaged in wrongdoing,    \neven though the financial institution had no  \ndirect knowledge of the activities engaged in \nby its client. Regulators and courts have also\nincreasingly found liability as a \u201ccontrol    \nperson\u201d for activities of entities in which   \nfinancial institutions or funds controlled by \nfinancial institutions have an investment, but\nwhich they do not actively manage. In         \naddition, regulators and courts continue to   \nseek to establish \u201cfiduciary\u201d obligations to  \ncounterparties to which no such duty had been \nassumed to exist. To the extent that such     \nefforts are successful, the cost of, and      \nliabilities associated with, engaging in      \nbrokerage, clearing, market-making, prime     \nbrokerage, investing and other similar        \nactivities could increase significantly. To   \nthe extent that we have fiduciary obligations \nin connection with acting as a financial      \nadviser or investment adviser or in other     \nroles for individual, institutional, sovereign\nor investment fund clients, any breach, or    \neven an alleged breach, of such obligations   \ncould have materially negative legal,         \nregulatory and reputational consequences. For \ninformation about the extensive regulation to \nwhich our businesses are subject, see         \n\u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of  \nthis Form 10-K. A failure to appropriately    \nidentify and address potential conflicts of   \ninterest could adversely affect our           \nbusinesses. Due to the broad scope of our     \nbusinesses and our client base, we regularly  \naddress potential conflicts of interest,      \nincluding situations where our services to a  \nparticular client or our own investments or   \nother interests conflict, or are perceived to \nconflict, with the interests of that client or\nanother client, as well as situations where   \none or more of our businesses have access to  \nmaterial non-publicinformation that may not be\nshared with our other businesses and          \nsituations where we may be a creditor of an   \nentity with which we also have an advisory or \nother relationship. In addition, our status as\na BHC subjects us to heightened regulation and\nincreased regulatory scrutiny by the FRB with \nrespect to transactions between GS Bank USA   \nand its subsidiaries and entities that are or \ncould be viewed as affiliates of ours and,    \nunder the Volcker Rule, transactions between  \nus and covered funds. We have extensive       \nprocedures and controls that are designed to  \nidentify and address conflicts of interest,   \nincluding those designed to prevent the       \nimproper sharing of information among our     \nbusinesses. However, appropriately identifying\nand dealing with conflicts of interest is     \ncomplex and difficult, and our reputation,    \nwhich is one of our most important assets,    \ncould be damaged and the willingness of       \nclients to enter into transactions with us may\nbe adversely affected if we fail, or appear to\nfail, to identify, disclose and deal          \nappropriately with conflicts of interest. In  \naddition, potential or perceived conflicts    \ncould give rise to litigation or regulatory   \nenforcement actions. Additionally, our One    \nGoldman Sachsinitiative aims to increase      \ncollaboration among our businesses, which may \nincrease the potential for actual or perceived\nconflicts of interest and improper information\nsharing. We may be adversely affected by      \nincreased governmental and regulatory scrutiny\nor negative publicity. Governmental scrutiny  \nfrom regulators, legislative bodies and law   \nenforcement agencies with respect to matters  \nrelating to compensation, our business        \npractices, our past actions and other matters \nremains at high levels. Political and public  \nsentiment regarding financial institutions has\nin the past and may in the future result in a \nsignificant amount of adverse press coverage, \nas well as adverse statements or charges by   \nregulators or other government officials.     \nPress coverage and other public statements    \nthat assert some form of wrongdoing           \n(including, in some cases, press coverage and \npublic statements that do not directly involve\nus) often result in some type of investigation\nby regulators, legislators and law enforcement\nofficials or in lawsuits.                     \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    45  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nResponding to these investigations and        \nlawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome  \nof the proceeding, is time-consuming and      \nexpensive and can divert the time and effort  \nof our senior management from our business.   \nPenalties and fines sought by regulatory      \nauthorities have increased substantially and  \ncertain regulators have been more likely in   \nrecent years to commence enforcement actions  \nor to support legislation targeted at the     \nfinancial services industry. Governmental     \nauthorities may also be more likely to pursue \ncriminal or other actions, including seeking  \nadmissions of wrongdoing or guilty pleas, in  \nconnection with the resolution of an inquiry  \nor investigation to the extent a company is   \nviewed as having previously engaged in        \ncriminal, regulatory or other misconduct.     \nAdverse publicity, governmental scrutiny and  \nlegal and enforcement proceedings can also    \nhave a negative impact on our reputation and  \non the morale and performance of our          \nemployees, which could adversely affect our   \nbusinesses and results of operations. The     \nfinancial services industry generally and our \nbusinesses in particular have been subject to \nnegative publicity. Our reputation and        \nbusinesses may be adversely affected by       \nnegative publicity or information regarding   \nour businesses and personnel, whether or not  \naccurate or true, that may be posted on social\nmedia or other internet forums or published by\nnews organizations. Postings on these types of\nforums may also adversely impact risk         \npositions of our clients and other parties    \nthat owe us money, securities or other assets \nand increase the chance that they will not    \nperform their obligations to us or reduce the \nrevenues we receive from their use of our     \nservices. The speed and pervasiveness with    \nwhich information can be disseminated through \nthese channels, in particular social media,   \nmay magnify risks relating to negative        \npublicity. Substantial civil or criminal      \nliability or significant regulatory action    \nagainst us could have material adverse        \nfinancial effects or cause us significant     \nreputational harm, which in turn could        \nseriously harm our business prospects. We face\nsignificant legal risks in our businesses, and\nthe volume of claims and amount of damages and\npenalties claimed in litigation and regulatory\nproceedings against financial institutions    \nremain high. See Notes 18 and 27 to the       \nconsolidated financial statements in Part II, \nItem 8 of this Form 10-Kfor information about \ncertain of our legal and regulatory           \nproceedings and investigations. We have seen  \nlegal claims by consumers and clients increase\nin a market downturn and employment-related   \nclaims increase following periods in which we \nhave reduced our headcount. Additionally,     \ngovernmental entities have been plaintiffs and\nare parties in certain of our legal           \nproceedings, and we may face future civil or  \ncriminal actions or claims by the same or     \nother governmental entities, as well as       \nfollow-oncivil litigation that is often       \ncommenced after regulatory settlements.       \nSignificant settlements by several large      \nfinancial institutions, including, in some    \ncases, us, with governmental entities have    \nbeen publicly announced. The trend of large   \nsettlements with governmental entities may    \nadversely affect the outcomes for other       \nfinancial institutions in similar actions,    \nespecially where governmental officials have  \nannounced that the large settlements will be  \nused as the basis or a template for other     \nsettlements. The uncertain regulatory         \nenforcement environment makes it difficult to \nestimate probable losses, which can lead to   \nsubstantial disparities between legal reserves\nand subsequent actual settlements or          \npenalties. Claims of collusion or anti-       \ncompetitive conduct have become more common.  \nCivil cases have been brought against         \nfinancial institutions (including us) alleging\nbid-rigging,group boycotts or other anti-     \ncompetitive practices. Antitrust laws         \ngenerally provide for joint and several       \nliability and treble damages. These claims    \nhave resulted in significant settlements in   \nthe past and may do so in the future. We are  \nsubject to laws and regulations worldwide,    \nincluding the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act,  \nrelating to corrupt and illegal payments to,  \nand hiring practices with regard to,          \ngovernment officials and others. Violation of \nthese or similar laws and regulations have in \nthe past resulted in and could in the future  \nresult in significant monetary penalties. Such\nviolations could also result in severe        \nrestrictions on our activities and damage to  \nour reputation. Certain law enforcement       \nauthorities have recently required admissions \nof wrongdoing, and, in some cases, criminal   \npleas, as part of the resolutions of matters  \nbrought against financial institutions or     \ntheir employees. See for example, \u201c1MDB-      \nRelated Matters\u201d in Note 27 to the            \nconsolidated financial statements in Part II, \nItem 8 of this Form 10-K.Any such resolution  \nof a criminal matter involving us or our      \nemployees could lead to increased exposure to \ncivil litigation, could adversely affect our  \nreputation, could result in penalties or      \nlimitations on our ability to conduct our     \nactivities generally or in certain            \ncircumstances and could have other negative   \neffects. Further, as a result of the 1MDB     \nsettlement, we are no longer a \u201cwell-known    \nseasoned issuer,\u201d which places limitations on \nthe manner in which we can market our         \nsecurities.                                   \n                                      \n  46    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn conducting our businesses around the world,\nwe are subject to political, legal, regulatory\nand other risks that are inherent in operating\nin many countries. In conducting our          \nbusinesses and supporting our global          \noperations, we are subject to risks of        \npossible nationalization, expropriation, price\ncontrols, capital controls, exchange controls,\ncommunications and other content restrictions,\nand other restrictive governmental actions.   \nFor example, sanctions have been imposed by   \nthe U.S. and the E.U. on certain individuals  \nand companies in Russia and Venezuela. In many\ncountries, the laws and regulations applicable\nto the securities and financial services      \nindustries and many of the transactions in    \nwhich we are involved are uncertain and       \nevolving, and it may be difficult for us to   \ndetermine the exact requirements of local laws\nin every market. We have been in some cases   \nsubject to divergent and conflicting laws and \nregulations across markets, and we are        \nincreasingly subject to the risk that the     \njurisdictions in which we operate may         \nimplement laws and regulations that directly  \nconflict with those of another jurisdiction.  \nAny determination by local regulators that we \nhave not acted in compliance with the         \napplication of local laws in a particular     \nmarket or our failure to develop effective    \nworking relationships with local regulators   \ncould have a significant and negative effect  \nnot only on our businesses in that market, but\nalso on our reputation generally. Further, in \nsome jurisdictions a failure, or alleged      \nfailure, to comply with laws and regulations  \nhas subjected and may in the future subject us\nand our personnel not only to civil actions,  \nbut also criminal actions and other sanctions.\nWe are also subject to the enhanced risk that \ntransactions we structure might not be legally\nenforceable in all cases. While business and  \nother practices throughout the world differ,  \nour principal entities are subject in their   \noperations worldwide to rules and regulations \nrelating to corrupt and illegal payments,     \nhiring practices and money laundering, as well\nas laws relating to doing business with       \ncertain individuals, groups and countries,    \nsuch as the FCPA, the BSA and the U.K. Bribery\nAct. While we have invested and continue to   \ninvest significant resources in training and  \nin compliance monitoring, the geographical    \ndiversity of our operations, employees,       \nclients and consumers, as well as the vendors \nand other third parties that we deal with,    \ngreatly increases the risk that we may be     \nfound in violation of such rules or           \nregulations and any such violation could      \nsubject us to significant penalties or        \nadversely affect our reputation. See for      \nexample, \u201c1MDB-Related Matters\u201d in Note 27 to \nthe consolidated financial statements in Part \nII, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In addition,    \nthere have been a number of highly publicized \ncases around the world, involving actual or   \nalleged fraud or other misconduct by employees\nin the financial services industry, and we    \nhave had and may in the future have employee  \nmisconduct. This misconduct has included and  \nmay also in the future include intentional    \nefforts to ignore or circumvent applicable    \npolicies, rules or procedures or              \nmisappropriation of funds and the theft of    \nproprietary information, including proprietary\nsoftware. It is not always possible to deter  \nor prevent employee misconduct and the        \nprecautions we take to prevent and detect this\nactivity have not been and may not be         \neffective in all cases, as reflected by the   \nsettlements relating to 1MDB. The application \nof regulatory strategies and requirements in  \nthe U.S. and non-U.S.jurisdictions to         \nfacilitate the orderly resolution of large    \nfinancial institutions could create greater   \nrisk of loss for Group Inc.\u2019s security        \nholders. As described in \u201cBusiness \u2014          \nRegulation \u2014 Banking Supervision and          \nRegulation \u2014 Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC,\u201d  \nif the FDIC is appointed as receiver under    \nOLA, the rights of Group Inc.\u2019s creditors     \nwould be determined under OLA, and substantial\ndifferences exist in the rights of creditors  \nbetween OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,     \nincluding the right of the FDIC under OLA to  \ndisregard the strict priority of creditor     \nclaims in some circumstances, which could have\na material adverse effect on our debtholders. \nThe FDIC has announced that a single point of \nentry strategy may be a desirable strategy    \nunder OLA to resolve a large financial        \ninstitution in a manner that would, among     \nother things, impose losses on shareholders,  \ndebtholders and other creditors of the top-   \ntierBHC (in our case, Group Inc.), while the  \nBHC\u2019s subsidiaries may continue to operate. It\nis possible that the application of the single\npoint of entry strategy under OLA, in which   \nGroup Inc. would be the only entity to enter  \nresolution proceedings (and its material      \nbroker-dealer, bank and other operating       \nentities would not enter resolution           \nproceedings), would result in greater losses  \nto Group Inc.\u2019s security holders (including   \nholders of our fixed rate, floating rate and  \nindexed debt securities), than the losses that\nwould result from the application of a        \nbankruptcy proceeding or a different          \nresolution strategy, such as a multiple point \nof entry resolution strategy for Group Inc.   \nand certain of its material subsidiaries.     \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    47  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAssuming Group Inc. entered resolution        \nproceedings and that support from Group Inc.  \nor other available resources to its           \nsubsidiaries was sufficient to enable the     \nsubsidiaries to remain solvent, losses at the \nsubsidiary level would be transferred to Group\nInc. and ultimately borne by Group Inc.\u2019s     \nsecurity holders, third-party creditors of    \nGroup Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries would receive full  \nrecoveries on their claims, and Group Inc.\u2019s  \nsecurity holders (including our shareholders, \ndebtholders and other unsecured creditors)    \ncould face significant and possibly complete  \nlosses. In that case, Group Inc.\u2019s security   \nholders would face losses while the third-    \nparty creditors of Group Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries  \nwould incur no losses because the subsidiaries\nwould continue to operate and would not enter \nresolution or bankruptcy proceedings. In      \naddition, holders of Group Inc.\u2019s eligible    \nlong-term debt and holders of Group Inc.\u2019s    \nother debt securities could face losses ahead \nof its other similarly situated creditors in a\nresolution under OLA if the FDIC exercised its\nright, described above, to disregard the      \npriority of creditor claims. OLA also provides\nthe FDIC with authority to cause creditors and\nshareholders of the financial company in      \nreceivership to bear losses before taxpayers  \nare exposed to such losses, and amounts owed  \nto the U.S. government would generally receive\na statutory payment priority over the claims  \nof private creditors, including senior        \ncreditors. In addition, under OLA, claims of  \ncreditors (including debtholders) could be    \nsatisfied through the issuance of equity or   \nother securities in a bridge entity to which  \nGroup Inc.\u2019s assets are transferred. If such a\nsecurities-for-claimsexchange were            \nimplemented, there can be no assurance that   \nthe value of the securities of the bridge     \nentity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy\nall or any part of the creditor claims for    \nwhich the securities were exchanged. While the\nFDIC has issued regulations to implement OLA, \nnot all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise\nthis authority are known and additional       \nrulemaking is possible. In addition, certain  \njurisdictions, including the U.K. and the     \nE.U., have implemented resolution regimes to  \nprovide resolution authorities with the       \nability to recapitalize a failing entity by   \nwriting down its unsecured debt or converting \nits unsecured debt into equity. Such \u201cbail-   \nin\u201dpowers are intended to enable the          \nrecapitalization of a failing institution by  \nallocating losses to its shareholders and     \nunsecured debtholders. For example, the Bank  \nof England requires a certain amount of       \nintercompany funding that we provide to our   \nmaterial U.K. subsidiaries to contain a       \ncontractual trigger to expressly permit the   \nBank of England to exercise such \u201cbail-       \nin\u201dpowers in certain circumstances. If the    \nintercompany funding we provide to our        \nsubsidiaries is \u201cbailed in,\u201d Group Inc.\u2019s     \nclaims on its subsidiaries would be           \nsubordinated to the claims of the             \nsubsidiaries\u2019 third-party creditors or written\ndown. U.S. regulators are considering and     \nnon-U.S.authorities have adopted requirements \nthat certain subsidiaries of large financial  \ninstitutions maintain minimum amounts of total\nloss-absorbing capacity that would pass losses\nup from the subsidiaries to the top-tierBHC   \nand, ultimately, to security holders of the   \ntop-tierBHC in the event of failure. The      \napplication of Group Inc.\u2019s proposed          \nresolution strategy could result in greater   \nlosses for Group Inc.\u2019s security holders. In  \nour resolution plan, Group Inc. would be      \nresolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The  \nstrategy described in our resolution plan is a\nvariant of the single point of entry strategy:\nGroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Funding LLC      \n(Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct         \nsubsidiary of Group Inc., would recapitalize  \nand provide liquidity to certain major        \nsubsidiaries, including through the           \nforgiveness of intercompany indebtedness, the \nextension of the maturities of intercompany   \nindebtedness and the extension of additional  \nintercompany loans. If this strategy were     \nsuccessful, creditors of some or all of Group \nInc.\u2019s major subsidiaries would receive full  \nrecoveries on their claims, while Group Inc.\u2019s\nsecurity holders could face significant and   \npossibly complete losses. To facilitate the   \nexecution of our resolution plan, we formed   \nFunding IHC. In exchange for an unsecured     \nsubordinated funding note and equity interest,\nGroup Inc. transferred certain intercompany   \nreceivables and substantially all of its GCLA \nto Funding IHC, and agreed to transfer        \nadditional GCLA above prescribed thresholds.  \n                                      \n  48    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe also put in place a Capital and Liquidity  \nSupport Agreement (CLSA) among Group Inc.,    \nFunding IHC and our major subsidiaries. Under \nthe CLSA, Funding IHC has provided Group Inc. \nwith a committed line of credit that allows   \nGroup Inc. to draw sufficient funds to meet   \nits cash needs during the ordinary course of  \nbusiness. In addition, if our financial       \nresources deteriorate so severely that        \nresolution may be imminent, (i) the committed \nline of credit will automatically terminate   \nand the unsecured subordinated funding note   \nwill automatically be forgiven, (ii) all      \nintercompany receivables owed by the major    \nsubsidiaries to Group Inc. will be transferred\nto Funding IHC or their maturities will be    \nextended to five years, (iii) Group Inc. will \nbe obligated to transfer substantially all of \nits remaining intercompany receivables and    \nGCLA (other than an amount to fund anticipated\nbankruptcy expenses) to Funding IHC, and (iv) \nFunding IHC will be obligated to provide      \ncapital and liquidity support to the major    \nsubsidiaries. Group Inc.\u2019s and Funding IHC\u2019s  \nobligations under the CLSA are secured        \npursuant to a related security agreement. Such\nactions would materially and adversely affect \nGroup Inc.\u2019s liquidity. As a result, during a \nperiod of severe stress, Group Inc. might     \ncommence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier \ntime than it otherwise would if the CLSA and  \nrelated security agreement had not been       \nimplemented. If Group Inc.\u2019s proposed         \nresolution strategy were successful, Group    \nInc.\u2019s security holders could face losses     \nwhile the third-party creditors of Group      \nInc.\u2019s major subsidiaries would incur no      \nlosses because those subsidiaries would       \ncontinue to operate and not enter resolution  \nor bankruptcy proceedings. As part of the     \nstrategy, Group Inc. could also seek to       \nelevate the priority of its guarantee         \nobligations relating to its major             \nsubsidiaries\u2019 derivative contracts or transfer\nthem to another entity so that cross-default  \nand early termination rights would be stayed  \nunder the ISDA Protocols, as applicable, which\nwould result in holders of Group Inc.\u2019s       \neligible long-term debt and holders of Group  \nInc.\u2019s other debt securities incurring losses \nahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee \nobligations. It is also possible that holders \nof Group Inc.\u2019s eligible long-term debt and   \nother debt securities could incur losses ahead\nof other similarly situated creditors of Group\nInc.\u2019s major subsidiaries. If Group Inc.\u2019s    \nproposed resolution strategy were not         \nsuccessful, Group Inc.\u2019s financial condition  \nwould be adversely impacted and Group Inc.\u2019s  \nsecurity holders, including debtholders, may  \nas a consequence be in a worse position than  \nif the strategy had not been implemented. In  \nall cases, any payments to debtholders are    \ndependent on our ability to make such payments\nand are therefore subject to our credit risk. \nAs a result of our recovery and resolution    \nplanning processes, including incorporating   \nfeedback from our regulators, we may incur    \nincreased operational, funding or other costs \nand face limitations on our ability to        \nstructure our internal organization or engage \nin internal or external activities in a manner\nthat we may otherwise deem most operationally \nefficient. Our commodities activities,        \nparticularly our physical commodities         \nactivities, subject us to extensive regulation\nand involve certain potential risks, including\nenvironmental, reputational and other risks   \nthat may expose us to significant liabilities \nand costs. As part of our commodities         \nbusiness, we purchase and sell certain        \nphysical commodities, arrange for their       \nstorage and transport, and engage in market   \nmaking of commodities.

In addition,  \nwe rely on third-party suppliers or service   \nproviders to perform their contractual        \nobligations and any failure on their part,    \nincluding the failure to obtain raw materials \nat reasonable prices or to safely transport or\nstore commodities, could expose us to costs or\nlosses. Also, while we seek to insure against \npotential risks, we may not be able to obtain \ninsurance to cover some of these risks and the\ninsurance that we have may be inadequate to   \ncover our losses. The occurrence of any of    \nsuch events may prevent us from performing    \nunder our agreements with clients, may impair \nour operations or financial results and may   \nresult in litigation, regulatory action,      \nnegative publicity or other reputational harm.\nWe may also be required to divest or          \ndiscontinue certain of these activities for   \nregulatory or legal reasons or due to the     \ntransition to a less carbon-dependent economy \nin response to climate change. Competition Our\nresults have been and may in the future be    \nadversely affected by the composition of our  \nclient base. Our client base is not the same  \nas that of our major competitors. Our         \nbusinesses may have a higher or lower         \npercentage of clients in certain industries or\nmarkets than some or all of our competitors.  \nTherefore, unfavorable industry developments  \nor market conditions affecting certain        \nindustries or markets have resulted in the    \npast and may result in the future in our      \nbusinesses underperforming relative to similar\nbusinesses of a competitor if our businesses  \nhave a higher concentration of clients in such\nindustries or markets. For example, our       \nmarket-making businesses have a higher        \npercentage of clients with actively managed   \nassets than some of our competitors and such  \nclients have in the past and may in the future\nbe disproportionately affected by low         \nvolatility. Correspondingly, favorable or     \nsimply less adverse developments or market    \nconditions involving industries or markets in \na business where we have a lower concentration\nof clients in such industry or market have    \nalso resulted in the past and may result in   \nthe future in our underperforming relative to \na similar business of a competitor that has a \nhigher concentration of clients in such       \nindustry or market. For example, we have a    \nsmaller corporate client base in our market-  \nmaking businesses than some of our peers and  \ntherefore those competitors may benefit more  \nfrom increased activity by corporate clients. \nSimilarly, we have not historically engaged in\nretail equities intermediation to the same    \nextent as other financial institutions, which \nhas in the past and could in the future       \nadversely affect our market share in equities \nexecution. The financial services industry is \nhighly competitive. The financial services    \nindustry and all of our businesses are        \nintensely competitive, and we expect them to  \nremain so. We compete on the basis of a number\nof factors, including transaction execution,  \nour products and services, innovation,        \nreputation, creditworthiness and price. There \nhas been substantial consolidation and        \nconvergence among companies in the financial  \nservices industry. This has hastened the      \nglobalization of the securities and other     \nfinancial services markets. As a result, we   \nhave had to commit capital to support our     \ninternational operations and to execute large \nglobal transactions. To the extent we expand  \ninto new business areas and new geographic    \nregions, we will face competitors with more   \nexperience and more established relationships \nwith clients, regulators and industry         \nparticipants in the relevant market, which    \ncould adversely affect our ability to expand. \nGovernments and regulators have adopted       \nregulations, imposed taxes, adopted           \ncompensation restrictions or otherwise put    \nforward various proposals that have impacted  \nor may impact our ability to conduct certain  \nof our businesses in a cost-effective manner  \nor at all in certain or all jurisdictions,    \nincluding proposals relating to restrictions  \non the type of activities in which financial  \ninstitutions are permitted to engage. These or\nother similar rules, many of which do not     \napply to all our U.S. or non-U.S.competitors, \ncould impact our ability to compete           \neffectively. Pricing and other competitive    \npressures in our businesses have continued to \nincrease, particularly in situations where    \nsome of our competitors may seek to increase  \nmarket share by reducing prices. For example, \nin connection with investment banking and     \nother assignments, in response to competitive \npressure we have experienced, we have extended\nand priced credit at levels that may not      \nalways fully compensate us for the risks we   \ntake.                                         \n                                      \n  50    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe financial services industry is highly     \ninterrelated in that a significant volume of  \ntransactions occur among a limited number of  \nmembers of that industry. Many transactions   \nare syndicated to other financial institutions\nand financial institutions are often          \ncounterparties in transactions. This has led  \nto claims by other market participants and    \nregulators that such institutions have        \ncolluded in order to manipulate markets or    \nmarket prices, including allegations that     \nantitrust laws have been violated. While we   \nhave extensive procedures and controls that   \nare designed to identify and prevent such     \nactivities, allegations of such activities,   \nparticularly by regulators, can have a        \nnegative reputational impact and can subject  \nus to large fines and settlements, and        \npotentially significant penalties, including  \ntreble damages. The growth of electronic      \ntrading and the introduction of new products  \nand technologies, including trading           \ntechnologies and cryptocurrencies, has        \nincreased competition. Technology is          \nfundamental to our business and our industry. \nThe growth of electronic trading and the      \nintroduction of new technologies is changing  \nour businesses and presenting us with new     \nchallenges. Securities, futures and options   \ntransactions are increasingly occurring       \nelectronically, both on our own systems and   \nthrough other alternative trading systems, and\nit appears that the trend toward alternative  \ntrading systems will continue. Some of these  \nalternative trading systems compete with us,  \nparticularly our exchange-based market-making \nactivities, and we may experience continued   \ncompetitive pressures in these and other      \nareas. In addition, the increased use by our  \nclients of low-costelectronic trading systems \nand direct electronic access to trading       \nmarkets could cause a reduction in commissions\nand spreads. As our clients increasingly use  \nour systems to trade directly in the markets, \nwe may incur liabilities as a result of their \nuse of our order routing and execution        \ninfrastructure. We have invested significant  \nresources into the development of electronic  \ntrading systems and expect to continue to do  \nso, but there is no assurance that the        \nrevenues generated by these systems will yield\nan adequate return, particularly given the    \ngenerally lower commissions arising from      \nelectronic trades. In addition, the emergence,\nadoption and evolution of new technologies,   \nincluding distributed ledgers, such as        \ncryptocurrencies and blockchain, have required\nus to invest resources to adapt our existing  \nproducts and services, and we expect to       \ncontinue to make such investments, which could\nbe material. The adoption and evolution of    \nsuch new technologies may also increase our   \ncompliance and regulatory costs. Further,     \ntechnologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that  \ndo not require intermediation could also      \nsignificantly disrupt payments processing and \nother financial services. Regulatory          \nlimitations on our involvement in products and\nplatforms involving technologies such as      \ncryptocurrencies may not apply equally or in  \nsome cases at all to certain of our           \ncompetitors. We may not be as timely or       \nsuccessful in developing or integrating, or   \neven able to develop or integrate, new        \nproducts and technologies, such as            \ncryptocurrencies, into our existing products  \nand services, adapting to changes in consumer \npreferences or achieving market acceptance of \nour products and services, any of which could \naffect our ability to attract or retain       \nclients, cause us to lose market share or     \nresult in service disruptions and in turn     \nreduce our revenues or otherwise adversely    \naffect us. Our businesses would be adversely  \naffected if we are unable to hire and retain  \nqualified employees. Our performance is       \nlargely dependent on the talents and efforts  \nof highly skilled people; therefore, our      \ncontinued ability to compete effectively in   \nour businesses, to manage our businesses      \neffectively and to expand into new businesses \nand geographic areas depends on our ability to\nattract new talented and diverse employees and\nto retain and motivate our existing employees.\nFactors that affect our ability to attract and\nretain such employees include the level and   \ncomposition of our compensation and benefits, \nand our reputation as a successful business   \nwith a culture of fairly hiring, training and \npromoting qualified employees. As a           \nsignificant portion of the compensation that  \nwe pay to our employees is in the form of     \nyear-enddiscretionary compensation, a         \nsignificant portion of which is in the form of\ndeferred equity-related awards, declines in   \nour profitability, or in the outlook for our  \nfuture profitability, as well as regulatory   \nlimitations on compensation levels and terms, \ncan negatively impact our ability to hire and \nretain highly qualified employees.            \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    51  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCompetition from within the financial services\nindustry and from businesses outside the      \nfinancial services industry, including the    \ntechnology industry, for qualified employees  \nhas often been intense. We have experienced   \nincreased competition in hiring and retaining \nemployees to address the demands of, expanding\nconsumer-oriented businesses and our          \ntechnology initiatives. This is also the case \nin emerging and growth markets, where we are  \noften competing for qualified employees with  \nentities that have a significantly greater    \npresence or more extensive experience in the  \nregion. Changes in law or regulation in       \njurisdictions in which our operations are     \nlocated that affect taxes on our employees\u2019   \nincome, or the amount or composition of       \ncompensation, may also adversely affect our   \nability to hire and retain qualified employees\nin those jurisdictions. As described further  \nin \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation \u2014 Compensation      \nPractices\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Form     \n10-K,our compensation practices are subject to\nreview by, and the standards of, the FRB. As a\nlarge global financial and banking            \ninstitution, we are subject to limitations on \ncompensation practices (which may or may not  \naffect the companies with which we compete for\ntalent) by the FRB, the PRA, the FCA, the FDIC\nand other regulators worldwide. These         \nlimitations have shaped our compensation      \npractices, which has in some cases adversely  \naffected our ability to attract and retain    \ntalented employees, in particular in relation \nto companies not subject to these limitations,\nand future legislation or regulation may have \nsimilar adverse effects. Our operating        \nexpenses and efficiency ratio depend, in part,\non our overall headcount and the proportion of\nour employees located in strategic locations. \nOur future human capital resource requirements\nand the benefits provided by strategic        \nlocations are uncertain, and we may not       \nrealize the benefits we anticipate. Market    \nDevelopments and General Business Environment \nOur businesses, financial condition, liquidity\nand results of operations have been and may in\nthe future be adversely affected by the       \nCOVID-19pandemic. The COVID-19pandemic created\neconomic and financial disruptions that have  \nin the past adversely affected and may in the \nfuture adversely affect our business,         \nfinancial condition, liquidity and results of \noperations. The extent to which the           \nCOVID-19pandemic will negatively affect our   \nbusinesses, financial condition, liquidity and\nresults of operations will depend on future   \ndevelopments, including the emergence of new  \nvariants of COVID-19and the effectiveness of  \nvaccines and treatments over the long term and\nagainst new variants, which are highly        \nuncertain and cannot be predicted. While      \nfinancial markets have rebounded from the     \nsignificant declines that occurred early in   \nthe pandemic and global economic conditions   \ngenerally improved in 2021, certain of the    \ncircumstances that arose or became more       \npronounced after the onset of the             \nCOVID-19pandemic persisted in 2021, including \n(i) relatively weak consumer confidence; (ii) \nlow levels of the federal funds rate and      \nyields on U.S. Treasury securities which, at  \ntimes, were near zero; (iii) ongoing          \nheightened credit risk with regard to         \nindustries that have been most severely       \nimpacted by the pandemic, including, at times,\noil and gas, gaming and lodging, and airlines;\n(iv) significant interest at times by         \ninvestors in liquidity products, which        \ngenerate lower fees, relative to risk assets, \nresulting in these products comprising a      \nhigher share of AUS as compared to the pre-   \npandemiccomposition; (v) higher cyber         \nsecurity, information security and operational\nrisks; and (vi) interruptions in the supply   \nchain that have adversely affected many       \nbusinesses and have contributed to higher     \nrates of inflation.                           \n                                      \n  52    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDepending on the duration and severity of the \npandemic going forward, as well as the effects\nof the pandemic on consumer and corporate     \nconfidence, the conditions noted above could  \ncontinue for an extended period and other     \nadverse developments may occur or reoccur,    \nincluding (i) a repeat, or worse, of the      \ndecline in the valuation of equity, fixed-    \nincome and commodity markets that occurred at \nthe outset of the pandemic; (ii) market       \ndislocations that may make hedging strategies \nless effective or ineffective; (iii) a        \nreduction in fees on AUS due to declines in   \nthe valuation of assets or a protracted trend \ntoward asset classes that generate lower fees;\n(iv) disruption in the new issuance markets   \nfor debt and equity, leading to a decline in  \nunderwriting volumes; (v) declines in         \ncompleted mergers and acquisitions; (vi) a    \ndeterioration in the liquidity profile of     \ncorporate borrowers, resulting in additional  \ndraws on credit lines; (vii) defaults by      \nconsumers or corporate clients on loans;      \n(viii) changes in consumer spending or        \nborrowing patterns; and (ix) greater          \nchallenges in valuing derivative positions and\nassociated collateral, leading to significant \nincreases in collateral calls and valuation   \ndisputes. The effects of the COVID-19pandemic \non economic and market conditions have in the \npast and may in the future also increase      \ndemands on our liquidity as we meet client    \nneeds. Likewise, these adverse developments   \nhave in the past and may in the future affect \nour capital and leverage ratios. The effects  \nof the COVID-19pandemic and FRB requirements  \nhave in the past limited and may in the future\nlimit capital distributions. Governmental     \nauthorities worldwide have taken increased    \nmeasures to stabilize the markets and support \neconomic growth. The continued success of     \nthese measures is unknown and they may not be \nsufficient to address future market           \ndislocations or avert severe and prolonged    \nreductions in economic activity. Certain of   \nour businesses, our funding instruments and   \nfinancial products may be adversely affected  \nby changes in or the discontinuance of        \nInterbank Offered Rates (IBORs), in particular\nLIBOR. The FCA and the administrator of LIBOR \nhave announced that the publication of the    \nmost commonly used USD LIBOR settings will    \ncease to be provided or cease to be           \nrepresentative after June 30, 2023. The       \npublication of all other LIBOR settings ceased\nto be provided or ceased to be representative \nas of December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal     \nbanking agencies had also issued guidance     \nstrongly encouraging banking organizations to \ncease using the USD LIBOR as a reference rate \nin new contracts by December 31, 2021 at the  \nlatest. As the transition from LIBOR is       \nongoing, there continues to be substantial    \nuncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the  \ntransition on the financial markets for LIBOR-\nlinked financial instruments. Similar         \ndevelopments have occurred with respect to    \nother IBORs. Uncertainty regarding IBORs and  \nthe taking of discretionary actions or        \nnegotiation or implementation of fallback     \nprovisions could result in pricing volatility,\nloss of market share in certain products,     \nadverse tax or accounting impacts, compliance,\nlegal and operational costs and risks         \nassociated with client disclosures, as well as\nsystems disruption, model disruption and other\nbusiness continuity issues. In addition,      \nuncertainty relating to IBORs could result in \nincreased capital requirements for us given   \npotential low transaction volumes, a lack of  \nliquidity or limited observability for        \nexposures linked to IBORs or any emerging     \nsuccessor rates and operational incidents     \nassociated with changes in and the            \ndiscontinuance of IBORs. The language in our  \ncontracts and financial instruments that      \ndefine IBORs, in particular LIBOR, have       \ndeveloped over time and have various events   \nthat trigger when a successor rate to the     \ndesignated rate would be selected. Once a     \ntrigger is satisfied, contracts and financial \ninstruments often give the calculation agent  \n(which may be us) discretion over the         \nsuccessor rate or benchmark to be selected. As\na result, for the most commonly used USD LIBOR\nsettings, there continues to be considerable  \nuncertainty as to how the financial services  \nindustry will address the discontinuance of   \ndesignated rates in contracts and financial   \ninstruments or such designated rates ceasing  \nto be acceptable reference rates. This        \nuncertainty could ultimately result in client \ndisputes and litigation surrounding the proper\ninterpretation of our IBOR-based contracts and\nfinancial instruments. For LIBOR settings that\nceased to be provided or ceased to be         \nrepresentative as of December 2021,           \ndiscretionary actions taken in connection with\nthe implementation of fallback provisions     \ncould also result in client disputes and      \nlitigation particularly for derivatives and   \nother synthetic instruments. Although we have \nadhered to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol,  \nthe protocol is applicable to derivatives when\nboth parties adhere to the protocol or        \notherwise agree for it to apply to their      \nderivatives.                                  \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    53  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For example, we  \ncontinue to transact business and invest in   \nnew regions, including a wide range of        \nemerging and growth markets, and we expect    \nthis trend to continue. Various emerging and  \ngrowth market countries have experienced      \nsevere economic and financial disruptions,    \nincluding significant devaluations of their   \ncurrencies, defaults or threatened defaults on\nsovereign debt, capital and currency exchange \ncontrols, and low or negative growth rates in \ntheir economies. The possible effects of any  \nof these conditions include an adverse impact \non our businesses and increased volatility in \nfinancial markets generally. Furthermore, in a\nnumber of our businesses, including where we  \nmake markets, invest and lend, we own         \ninterests in, or otherwise become affiliated  \nwith the ownership and operation of, public   \nservices, such as airports, toll roads and    \nshipping ports, as well as physical           \ncommodities and commodities infrastructure    \ncomponents, both within and outside the U.S.  \nWe have increased and intend to further       \nincrease our consumer-oriented deposit-taking \nand lending activities. For example, we now   \nissue credit cards to consumers and through   \nour pending acquisition of GreenSky, we intend\nto expand our offering of point-of-           \nsalefinancing. To the extent we engage in     \nthose and other consumer-oriented activities, \nwe have faced, and would continue to face,    \nadditional compliance, legal and regulatory   \nrisk, increased reputational risk and         \nincreased operational risk due to, among other\nthings, higher transaction volumes and        \nsignificantly increased retention and         \ntransmission of consumer and client           \ninformation. Acquisitions and new products can\nalso expose us to new or different types of   \nrisks. For example, providing point-of-       \nsalefinancing through GreenSky will also      \nsubject us to risks relating to retaining and \nattracting merchants and servicing loans for  \nother banks, as well as potential liability   \nfor remediation costs if merchants fail to    \nfulfill their obligations to consumers. We are\nalso subject to additional legal requirements,\nincluding with respect to suitability and     \nconsumer protection (for example, Regulation  \nBest Interest, fair lending laws and          \nregulations and privacy laws and regulations).\nFurther, identity fraud may increase and      \ncredit reporting practices may change in a    \nmanner that makes it more difficult for       \nfinancial institutions, such as us, to        \nevaluate the creditworthiness of consumers.   \n                                      \n  54    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe have increased and intend to further       \nincrease our transaction banking activities.  \nAs a result, we expect to face additional     \ncompliance, legal and regulatory risk,        \nincluding with respect to know-your-customer, \nanti-money laundering and reporting           \nrequirements and prohibitions on transfers of \nproperty belonging to countries, entities and \nindividuals subject to sanctions by U.S. or   \nother governmental authorities. New business  \ninitiatives expose us to new and enhanced     \nrisks, including risks associated with dealing\nwith governmental entities, reputational      \nconcerns arising from dealing with different  \ntypes of clients, business partners,          \ncounterparties and investors, greater         \nregulatory scrutiny of these activities,      \nincreased credit-related, market, sovereign   \nand operational risks, risks arising from     \naccidents or acts of terrorism, and           \nreputational concerns with the manner in which\ncertain assets are being operated or held or  \nin which we interact with these clients,      \nbusiness partners, counterparties and         \ninvestors. Legal, regulatory and reputational \nrisks may also exist in connection with       \nactivities and transactions involving new     \nproducts or markets where there is regulatory \nuncertainty or where there are different or   \nconflicting regulations depending on the      \nregulator or the jurisdiction involved,       \nparticularly where transactions in such       \nproducts may involve multiple jurisdictions.  \nWe have developed and pursued new business and\nstrategic initiatives, including acquisitions,\nand expect to continue to do so. If and to the\nextent we are unable to successfully execute  \nthose initiatives, we may incur unanticipated \ncosts and losses, and face other adverse      \nconsequences, such as negative reputational   \neffects. In addition, the actual effects of   \npursuing those initiatives may differ,        \npossibly materially, from the benefits that we\nexpect to realize from them, such as          \ngenerating additional revenues, achieving     \nexpense savings, reducing operational risk    \nexposures or using capital and funding more   \nefficiently. Engaging in new activities       \nexposes us to a variety of risks, including   \nthat we may be unable to successfully develop \nnew, competitive, efficient and effective     \nsystems and processes, and hire and retain the\nnecessary personnel. Due to our lack of       \nhistorical experience with unsecured consumer \nlending, our loan loss assumptions may prove  \nto be incorrect and we may incur losses       \nsignificantly above those which we originally \nanticipated in entering the business or in    \nexpanding the product offerings for the       \nbusiness. In recent years, we have invested,  \nand may continue to invest, more in businesses\nthat we expect will generate a higher level of\nmore consistent revenues. In order to develop \nand be able to offer consumer financial       \nproducts that compete effectively, we have    \nmade and expect to continue to make           \nsignificant investments in technology and     \nhuman capital resources in connection with our\nconsumer-oriented activities. Such investments\nand acquisitions may not be successful or have\nreturns similar to our other businesses. We   \nmay not be able to fully realize the expected \nbenefits or synergies from acquisitions in the\ntime frames we expect, or at all. We have been\nengaging in selective acquisitions and expect \nto continue to do so in the future and these  \nacquisitions may, individually or in the      \naggregate, be material to us. Any future      \nacquisitions could involve the issuance of    \ncommon stock and/or the payment of cash as    \nconsideration. The success of our acquisitions\nwill depend, in part, on our ability to       \nintegrate the acquired businesses and realize \nanticipated synergies, cost savings and growth\nopportunities. We may face numerous risks and \nuncertainties in combining and integrating the\nrelevant businesses and systems, including the\nneed to combine or separate accounting and    \ndata processing systems and management        \ncontrols and to integrate relationships with  \nclients, counterparties, regulators and others\nin connection with acquisitions. Integration  \nof acquired businesses is time-consumingand   \ncould disrupt our ongoing businesses, produce \nunforeseen regulatory or operating            \ndifficulties, cause us to incur incremental   \nexpenses or require incremental financial,    \nmanagement and other resources. It is also    \npossible that an acquisition, once announced, \nmay not close due to the failure to satisfy   \napplicable closing conditions, such as the    \nreceipt of necessary shareholder or regulatory\napprovals. There is no assurance that any of  \nour acquisitions will be successfully         \nintegrated or yield all of the expected       \npositive benefits and synergies in the time   \nframes that we expect, or at all. If we are   \nnot able to integrate our acquisitions        \nsuccessfully, our results of operations,      \nfinancial condition and cash flows could be   \nadversely affected.                           \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    55  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Item 2. Properties In \nthe U.S. and elsewhere in the Americas, we    \nhave offices consisting of approximately 6.6  \nmillion square feet of leased and owned space.\nOur principal executive offices are located at\n200 West Street, New York, New York and       \nconsist of approximately 2.1 million square   \nfeet. The building is located on a parcel     \nleased from Battery Park City Authority       \npursuant to a ground lease. Under the lease,  \nBattery Park City Authority holds title to all\nimprovements, including the office building,  \nsubject to our right of exclusive possession  \nand use until June 2069, the expiration date  \nof the lease. Under the terms of the ground   \nlease, we made a lump sum ground rent payment \nin June 2007 of $161 million for rent through \nthe term of the lease. In Europe, the Middle  \nEast and Africa, we have offices consisting of\napproximately 1.6 million square feet of      \nleased and owned space. Our European          \nheadquarters is located in London at Plumtree \nCourt, consisting of approximately 826,000    \nsquare feet under a lease which can be        \nterminated in 2039. In Asia, Australia and New\nZealand, we have offices consisting of        \napproximately 2.6 million square feet,        \nincluding our offices in India, and regional  \nheadquarters in Tokyo and Hong Kong. In India,\nwe have offices with approximately 1.6 million\nsquare feet, the majority of which have leases\nthat will expire in 2028. In the preceding    \nparagraphs, square footage figures are        \nprovided only for properties that are used in \nthe operation of our businesses. We regularly \nevaluate our space capacity in relation to    \ncurrent and projected headcount. We may incur \nexit costs in the future if we (i) reduce our \nspace capacity or (ii) commit to, or occupy,  \nnew properties in locations in which we       \noperate and dispose of existing space that had\nbeen held for potential growth. These costs   \nmay be material to our operating results in a \ngiven period. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are\ninvolved in a number of judicial, regulatory  \nand arbitration proceedings concerning matters\narising in connection with the conduct of our \nbusinesses. Many of these proceedings are in  \nearly stages, and many of these cases seek an \nindeterminate amount of damages. We have      \nestimated the upper end of the range of       \nreasonably possible aggregate loss for matters\nwhere we have been able to estimate a range   \nand we believe, based on currently available  \ninformation, that the results of matters where\nwe have not been able to estimate a range of  \nreasonably possible loss, in the aggregate,   \nwill not have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition, but may be material to   \nour operating results in a given period. Given\nthe range of litigation and investigations    \npresently under way, our litigation expenses  \nmay remain high.

Executive Overview We generated   \nnet earnings of $21.64 billion for 2021,      \nsignificantly higher compared with $9.46      \nbillion for 2020. Diluted earnings per common \nshare (EPS) was $59.45 for 2021, significantly\nhigher compared with $24.74 for 2020. Return  \non average common shareholders\u2019 equity (ROE)  \nwas 23.0% for 2021, compared with 11.1% for   \n2020. Book value per common share was $284.39 \nas of December 2021, 20.4% higher compared    \nwith December 2020. During 2020, we recorded  \nnet provisions for litigation and regulatory  \nproceedings of $3.42 billion, which reduced   \ndiluted EPS by $9.51 and reduced ROE by 3.9   \npercentage points. Net revenues were $59.34   \nbillion for 2021, 33% higher than 2020,       \nreflecting higher net revenues across all     \nsegments, including significant increases in  \nAsset Management, Investment Banking and      \nConsumer & Wealth Management. Net revenues in \nAsset Management primarily reflected          \nsignificantly higher net revenues in Equity   \ninvestments and Lending and debt investments, \nnet revenues in Investment Banking primarily  \nreflected significantly higher net revenues in\nFinancial advisory and Underwriting, and net  \nrevenues in Consumer & Wealth Management      \nreflected growth in both Wealth management and\nConsumer banking net revenues. Net revenues in\nGlobal Markets were slightly higher,          \nreflecting significantly higher net revenues  \nin Equities, partially offset by lower net    \nrevenues in Fixed Income, Currency and        \nCommodities (FICC) compared with a strong     \nprior year. Provision for credit losses was   \n$357 million for 2021, compared with $3.10    \nbillion for 2020. 2021 included provisions    \nrelated to portfolio growth (primarily in     \ncredit cards, including provisions related to \nthe commitment to acquire the General Motors  \nco-brandedcredit card portfolio), largely     \noffset by reserve reductions on wholesale and \nconsumer loans reflecting continued           \nimprovement in the broader economic           \nenvironment. This followed challenging        \nconditions in the prior year as a result of   \nthe impact of the COVID-19pandemic, which     \ncontributed to significant provisions in 2020.\nOperating expenses were $31.94 billion for    \n2021, 10% higher than 2020, primarily         \nreflecting significantly higher compensation  \nand benefits expenses (reflecting strong      \nperformance). In addition, technology expenses\nand professional fees were significantly      \nhigher and transaction based expenses were    \nhigher. These increases were partially offset \nby significantly lower net provisions for     \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings and     \nlower expenses related to consolidated        \ninvestments (including impairments). Our      \nefficiency ratio (total operating expenses    \ndivided by total net revenues) for 2021 was   \n53.8%, compared with 65.0% for 2020. In 2020, \nnet provisions for litigation and regulatory  \nproceedings increased our efficiency ratio by \n7.6 percentage points.                        \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    59  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Allowance\nfor Credit Losses We estimate and record an   \nallowance for credit losses related to our    \nloans held for investment that are accounted  \nfor at amortized cost. To determine the       \nallowance for credit losses, we classify our  \nloans accounted for at amortized cost into    \nwholesale and consumer portfolios. These      \nportfolios represent the level at which we    \nhave developed and documented our methodology \nto determine the allowance for credit losses. \nThe allowance for credit losses is measured on\na collective basis for loans that exhibit     \nsimilar risk characteristics using a modeled  \napproach and asset-specific basis for loans   \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics. The allowance for credit     \nlosses takes into account the weighted average\nof a range of forecasts of future economic    \nconditions over the expected life of the loans\nand lending commitments. The expected life of \neach loan or lending commitment is determined \nbased on the contractual term adjusted for    \nextension options or demand features, or is   \nmodeled in the case of revolving credit card  \nloans. The forecasts include baseline,        \nfavorable and adverse economic scenarios over \na three-year period. For loans with expected  \nlives beyond three years, the model reverts to\nhistorical loss information based on a non-   \nlinearmodeled approach. We apply judgment in  \nweighting individual scenarios each quarter   \nbased on a variety of factors, including our  \ninternally derived economic outlook, market   \nconsensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and\nindustry trends. The forecasted economic      \nscenarios consider a number of risk factors   \nrelevant to the wholesale and consumer        \nportfolios. Risk factors for wholesale loans  \ninclude internal credit ratings, industry     \ndefault and loss data, expected life,         \nmacroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment  \nrates and GDP), the borrower\u2019s capacity to    \nmeet its financial obligations, the borrower\u2019s\ncountry of risk and industry, loan seniority  \nand collateral type. In addition, for loans   \nbacked by real estate, risk factors include   \nloan-to-valueratio, debt service ratio and    \nhome price index. Risk factors for installment\nand credit card loans include Fair Isaac      \nCorporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency \nstatus, loan vintage and macroeconomic        \nindicators. The allowance for credit losses   \nalso includes qualitative components which    \nallow management to reflect the uncertain     \nnature of economic forecasting, capture       \nuncertainty regarding model inputs, and       \naccount for model imprecision and             \nconcentration risk. Our estimate of credit    \nlosses entails judgment about collectability  \nat the reporting dates, and there are         \nuncertainties inherent in those judgments. The\nallowance for credit losses is subject to a   \ngovernance process that involves review and   \napproval by senior management within our      \nindependent risk oversight and control        \nfunctions. Personnel within our independent   \nrisk oversight and control functions are      \nresponsible for forecasting the economic      \nvariables that underlie the economic scenarios\nthat are used in the modeling of expected     \ncredit losses. While we use the best          \ninformation available to determine this       \nestimate, future adjustments to the allowance \nmay be necessary based on, among other things,\nchanges in the economic environment or        \nvariances between actual results and the      \noriginal assumptions used. Loans are charged  \noff against the allowance for loan losses when\ndeemed to be uncollectible. We also record an \nallowance for credit losses on lending        \ncommitments which are held for investment that\nare accounted for at amortized cost. Such     \nallowance is determined using the same        \nmethodology as the allowance for loan losses, \nwhile also taking into consideration the      \nprobability of drawdowns or funding, and      \nwhether such commitments are cancellable by   \nus. To estimate the potential impact of an    \nadverse macroeconomic environment on our      \nallowance for credit losses, we, among other  \nthings, compared the expected credit losses   \nunder the weighted average forecast used in   \nthe calculation of allowance for credit losses\nas of December 2021 (which was primarily      \nweighted towards the baseline economic        \nscenario) to the expected credit losses under \na 100% weighted adverse economic scenario. The\nadverse macroeconomic model assumes an        \nemergence of new vaccine-resistant strains of \nCOVID-19resulting in a resurgence of          \ninfections, an economic contraction, high     \ninflation rates in the initial quarters,      \ngradually climbing unemployment rates, decline\nin GDP growth rates and dislocations in the   \neconomy due to shortages in the supply of some\ngoods and services. A 100% weighting to the   \nadverse economic scenario would have resulted \nin an approximate $1.3 billion increase in our\nallowance for credit losses as of December    \n2021. This hypothetical increase does not take\ninto consideration any potential adjustments  \nto qualitative reserves. The forecasts of     \nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently       \nuncertain and do not take into account any    \nother offsetting or correlated effects. The   \nactual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic\nenvironment may differ significantly from this\nestimate. See Note 9 to the consolidated      \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout the allowance for credit losses.        \n                                      \n  62    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Use of   \nEstimates U.S. GAAP requires us to make       \ncertain estimates and assumptions. In addition\nto the estimates we make in connection with   \nfair value measurements and the allowance for \ncredit losses on loans and lending commitments\nheld for investment and accounted for at      \namortized cost, the use of estimates and      \nassumptions is also important in determining  \nthe accounting for goodwill and identifiable  \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and accounting for income    \ntaxes. Goodwill is assessed for impairment    \nannually in the fourth quarter or more        \nfrequently if events occur or circumstances   \nchange that indicate an impairment may exist. \nWhen assessing goodwill for impairment, first,\na qualitative assessment can be made to       \ndetermine whether it is more likely than not  \nthat the estimated fair value of a reporting  \nunit is less than its estimated carrying      \nvalue. If the results of the qualitative      \nassessment are not conclusive, a quantitative \ngoodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a  \nquantitative goodwill test can be performed   \nwithout performing a qualitative assessment.  \nEstimating the fair value of our reporting    \nunits requires judgment. Critical inputs to   \nthe fair value estimates include projected    \nearnings and allocated equity. There is       \ninherent uncertainty in the projected         \nearnings. The estimated carrying value of each\nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and represents the       \nestimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity\nrequired to support the activities of the     \nreporting unit under currently applicable     \nregulatory capital requirements. See Note 12  \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about goodwill. If we     \nexperience a prolonged or severe period of    \nweakness in the business environment,         \nfinancial markets, our performance or our     \ncommon stock price, or additional increases in\ncapital requirements, our goodwill could be   \nimpaired in the future. Identifiable          \nintangible assets are tested for impairment   \nwhen events or changes in circumstances       \nsuggest that an asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s      \ncarrying value may not be fully recoverable.  \nJudgment is required to evaluate whether      \nindications of potential impairment have      \noccurred, and to test intangible assets for   \nimpairment, if required. An impairment is     \nrecognized if the estimated undiscounted cash \nflows relating to the asset or asset group is \nless than the corresponding carrying value.   \nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial     \nstatements for further information about      \nidentifiable intangible assets. We also       \nestimate and provide for potential losses that\nmay arise out of litigation and regulatory    \nproceedings to the extent that such losses are\nprobable and can be reasonably estimated. In  \naddition, we estimate the upper end of the    \nrange of reasonably possible aggregate loss in\nexcess of the related reserves for litigation \nand regulatory proceedings where we believe   \nthe risk of loss is more than slight. See     \nNotes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial \nstatements for information about certain      \njudicial, litigation and regulatory           \nproceedings. Significant judgment is required \nin making these estimates and our final       \nliabilities may ultimately be materially      \ndifferent. Our total estimated liability in   \nrespect of litigation and regulatory          \nproceedings is determined on a case-by-       \ncasebasis and represents an estimate of       \nprobable losses after considering, among other\nfactors, the progress of each case, proceeding\nor investigation, our experience and the      \nexperience of others in similar cases,        \nproceedings or investigations, and the        \nopinions and views of legal counsel. In       \naccounting for income taxes, we recognize tax \npositions in the financial statements only    \nwhen it is more likely than not that the      \nposition will be sustained on examination by  \nthe relevant taxing authority based on the    \ntechnical merits of the position. As of       \nDecember 2021, our net liability for          \nunrecognized tax benefits was $1.16 billion.  \nWe use estimates to recognize current and     \ndeferred income taxes in the U.S. federal,    \nstate and local and non-U.S.jurisdictions in  \nwhich we operate. The income tax laws in these\njurisdictions are complex and can be subject  \nto different interpretations between taxpayers\nand taxing authorities. Disputes may arise    \nover these interpretations and can be settled \nby audit, administrative appeals or judicial  \nproceedings. Our interpretations are          \nreevaluated quarterly based on guidance       \ncurrently available, tax examination          \nexperience and the opinions of legal counsel, \namong other factors. We recognize deferred    \ntaxes based on the amount that will more      \nlikely than not be realized in the future     \nbased on enacted income tax laws. As of       \nDecember 2021, we had $6.32 billion of        \ndeferred tax assets with a related valuation  \nallowance of $895 million. Our estimate for   \ndeferred taxes includes estimates for future  \ntaxable earnings, including the level and     \ncharacter of those earnings, and various tax  \nplanning strategies.

Tangible common            \n       shareholders\u2019 equity and ROTE          \n       arenon-GAAPmeasures and may not be     \n       comparable to similarnon-GAAPmeasures  \n       used by other companies.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nEnvironment. During 2021, a general recovery  \nof the global economy, continued monetary and \nfiscal support from central banks and         \ngovernments and accelerating vaccine          \ndistribution provided a favorable market      \nbackdrop. These factors contributed to        \ngenerally higher global equity prices and     \ntighter credit spreads compared with the end  \nof 2020. In addition, market-making activities\nreflected strong client activity levels,      \nalthough activity declined from a very strong \nprior year which reflected heightened         \nvolatility and significant market dislocations\nas a result of the COVID-19pandemic, and      \ninvestment banking activity levels across     \nmergers and acquisitions and underwriting were\nelevated. If concerns about the economic      \noutlook, including those on inflation and     \nsupply chain issues, grow or the ongoing      \nefforts to mitigate the impact of the         \nCOVID-19pandemic are ineffective (including   \ndue to new variants or complications with     \nvaccine distribution, efficacy and hesitancy),\nit may lead to a decline in global equity     \nmarkets, a decline in investment banking      \nactivity levels, and a continued decline in   \nmarket-making activity levels, and net        \nrevenues and the provision for credit losses  \nwould likely be negatively impacted. See      \n\u201cSegment Assets and Operating Results \u2014       \nSegment Operating Results\u201d for information    \nabout the operating environment and material  \ntrends and uncertainties that may impact our  \nresults of operations. 2021 versus 2020. Net  \nrevenues in the consolidated statements of    \nearnings were $59.34 billion for 2021, 33%    \nhigher than 2020, reflecting significantly    \nhigher other principal transactions revenues, \ninvestment banking revenues and net interest  \nincome, and higher investment management      \nrevenues. Non-InterestRevenues. Investment    \nbanking revenues in the consolidated          \nstatements of earnings were $14.17 billion for\n2021, 55% higher than 2020, due to            \nsignificantly higher revenues in financial    \nadvisory, reflecting a significant increase in\ncompleted mergers and acquisitions volumes, in\nequity underwriting, primarily driven by      \nstrong industry-wide initial public offerings \nactivity, and in debt underwriting, primarily \nreflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged   \nfinance activity. Investment management       \nrevenues in the consolidated statements of    \nearnings were $8.06 billion for 2021, 16%     \nhigher than 2020, primarily due to higher     \nmanagement and other fees, reflecting the     \nimpact of higher average AUS, partially offset\nby higher fee waivers on money market funds.  \nIn addition, incentive fees were significantly\nhigher, primarily driven by harvesting.       \nCommissions and fees in the consolidated      \nstatements of earnings were $3.62 billion for \n2021, slightly higher than 2020. Market making\nrevenues in the consolidated statements of    \nearnings were $15.35 billion for 2021,        \nessentially unchanged compared with 2020, as  \nsignificantly lower revenues in interest rate \nproducts and credit products were largely     \noffset by significantly higher revenues in    \nequity products (primarily in derivatives) and\ncommodities, and improved results in          \nmortgages. Other principal transactions       \nrevenues in the consolidated statements of    \nearnings were $11.67 billion for 2021,        \ncompared with $4.65 billion for 2020,         \nprimarily reflecting significantly higher net \ngains from investments in private equities and\nin debt instruments, partially offset by net  \nlosses from investments in public equities    \ncompared with significant net gains in 2020.  \nNet Interest Income. Net interest income in   \nthe consolidated statements of earnings was   \n$6.47 billion for 2021, 36% higher than 2020, \nreflecting a decrease in interest expense,    \npartially offset by a decrease in interest    \nincome. The decrease in interest expense is   \nprimarily related to other interest-bearing   \nliabilities, deposits and long-term           \nborrowings, each reflecting the impact of     \nlower interest rates. The decrease in interest\nincome primarily related to collateralized    \nagreements and trading assets, both reflecting\nthe impact of lower interest rates, partially \noffset by the impact of higher average        \nbalances for loans.

In this role, we seek to earn the\ndifference between the price at which a market\nparticipant is willing to sell an instrument  \nto us and the price at which another market   \nparticipant is willing to buy it from us, and \nvice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In       \naddition, we maintain (i) market-making       \npositions, typically for a short period of    \ntime, in response to, or in anticipation of,  \nclient demand, and (ii) positions to actively \nmanage our risk exposures that arise from     \nthese market-making activities (collectively, \ninventory). Our inventory is recorded in      \ntrading assets (long positions) or trading    \nliabilities (short positions) in our          \nconsolidated balance sheets. Our results are  \ninfluenced by a combination of interconnected \ndrivers, including (i) client activity levels \nand transactional bid/offer spreads           \n(collectively, client activity), and (ii)     \nchanges in the fair value of our inventory and\ninterest income and interest expense related  \nto the holding, hedging and funding of our    \ninventory (collectively, market-making        \ninventory changes). Due to the integrated     \nnature of our market-making activities,       \ndisaggregation of net revenues into client    \nactivity and market-making inventory changes  \nis judgmental and has inherent complexities   \nand limitations. The amount and composition of\nour net revenues vary over time as these      \ndrivers are impacted by multiple interrelated \nfactors affecting economic and market         \nconditions, including volatility and liquidity\nin the market, changes in interest rates,     \ncurrency exchange rates, credit spreads,      \nequity prices and commodity prices, investor  \nconfidence, and other macroeconomic concerns  \nand uncertainties. In general, assuming all   \nother market-making conditions remain         \nconstant, increases in client activity levels \nor bid/offer spreads tend to result in        \nincreases in net revenues, and decreases tend \nto have the opposite effect. However, changes \nin market-making conditions can materially    \nimpact client activity levels and bid/offer   \nspreads, as well as the fair value of our     \ninventory. For example, a decrease in         \nliquidity in the market could have the impact \nof (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii)  \ndecreasing investor confidence and thereby    \ndecreasing client activity levels, and (iii)  \nwidening of credit spreads on our inventory   \npositions.                                    \n                                      \n  70    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

During 2021, improved  \nmarket and economic conditions contributed to \na more favorable backdrop for consumer banking\nand wealth management activities. Global      \nequity prices were generally higher and, in   \nthe U.S., unemployment decreased and consumer \nspending increased compared with 2020, aided  \nby optimism about the economic recovery and   \ncontinued support from central banks and      \ngovernments globally. If optimism about the   \neconomic outlook declines or the ongoing      \nefforts to mitigate the impact of the         \nCOVID-19pandemic are ineffective, it may lead \nto a decline in asset prices, investors       \nfavoring asset classes that typically generate\nlower fees, investors withdrawing their assets\nand consumers withdrawing their deposits or   \ndeterioration in consumer credit, net revenues\nand the provision for credit losses in        \nConsumer & Wealth Management would likely be  \nnegatively impacted. 2021 versus 2020. Net    \nrevenues in Consumer & Wealth Management were \n$7.47 billion for 2021, 25% higher than 2020. \nNet revenues in Wealth management were $5.98  \nbillion, 25% higher than 2020, due to         \nsignificantly higher Management and other     \nfees, primarily reflecting the impact of      \nhigher average assets under supervision, and  \nsignificantly higher net revenues in Private  \nbanking and lending, primarily reflecting     \nhigher loan balances. In addition, Incentive  \nfees were higher, primarily due to harvesting.\nNet revenues in Consumer banking were $1.49   \nbillion, 23% higher than 2020, reflecting     \nhigher credit card and deposit balances.      \nProvision for credit losses was $592 million  \nfor 2021, 22% lower than 2020, primarily due  \nto reserve reductions in the current year     \nreflecting continued improvement in the       \nbroader economic environment following        \nchallenging conditions in 2020, partially     \noffset by growth in credit card balances,     \nincluding approximately $185 million of       \nprovisions related to the commitment to       \nacquire the General Motors co-brandedcredit   \ncard portfolio. Operating expenses were $6.29 \nbillion for 2021, 28% higher than 2020,       \nprimarily reflecting significantly higher     \ncompensation and benefits expenses (reflecting\nstrong performance).

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis The FRB  \nevaluates us based, in part, on whether we    \nhave the capital necessary to continue        \noperating under the baseline and severely     \nadverse scenarios provided by the FRB and     \nthose developed internally. This evaluation   \nalso takes into account our process for       \nidentifying risk, our controls and governance \nfor capital planning, and our guidelines for  \nmaking capital planning decisions. In         \naddition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make  \ncapital distributions (i.e., dividend payments\nand repurchases or redemptions of stock,      \nsubordinated debt or other capital securities)\nand issue capital, across the range of        \nmacroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific     \nassumptions. The FRB determines the SCB       \napplicable to us based on its own annual      \nstress test. The SCB under the Standardized   \napproach is calculated as (i) the difference  \nbetween our starting and minimum projected    \nCET1 capital ratios under the supervisory     \nseverely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned\ncommon stock dividends for each of the fourth \nthrough seventh quarters of the planning      \nhorizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-   \nweighted assets (RWAs). We submitted our 2021 \nCCAR capital plan in April 2021 and published \na summary of our annual DFAST results in June \n2021. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Available Information\u201d  \nin Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.Based on  \nour 2021 CCAR submission, the FRB reduced our \nSCB from 6.6% to 6.4%, resulting in a         \nStandardized CET1 capital ratio requirement of\n13.4% for the period from October 1, 2021     \nthrough September 30, 2022. See \u201cShare        \nRepurchase Program\u201d for further information   \nabout common stock repurchases and dividends. \nGS Bank USA has its own capital planning      \nprocess and, starting in 2022, will be        \nrequired to submit its annual stress test     \nresults to the FRB. GSI, GSIB and Goldman     \nSachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) also have their   \nown capital planning and stress testing       \nprocesses, which incorporate internally       \ndesigned stress tests developed in accordance \nwith the guidelines of their respective       \nregulators. Contingency Capital Plan. As part \nof our comprehensive capital management       \npolicy, we maintain a contingency capital     \nplan. Our contingency capital plan provides a \nframework for analyzing and responding to a   \nperceived or actual capital deficiency,       \nincluding, but not limited to, identification \nof drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as\nmitigants and potential actions. It outlines  \nthe appropriate communication procedures to   \nfollow during a crisis period, including      \ninternal dissemination of information, as well\nas timely communication with external         \nstakeholders. Capital Attribution. We assess  \neach of our businesses\u2019 capital usage based on\nour internal assessment of risks, which       \nincorporates an attribution of our relevant   \nregulatory capital requirements. These        \nregulatory capital requirements are allocated \nusing our attributed equity framework, which  \ntakes into consideration our most binding     \ncapital constraints. Our most binding capital \nconstraint is based on the results of the     \nFRB\u2019s annual stress test, which includes the  \nStandardized risk-based capital and leverage  \nratios. We review and make any necessary      \nadjustments to our attributed equity in       \nJanuary each year, to reflect, among other    \nthings, the results of our latest CCAR        \nprocess, as well as projected changes in our  \nbalance sheet. On January 1, 2021, our        \nallocation of attributed equity changed       \n(relative to the allocation as of December    \n2020) as follows: attributed equity increased \nby approximately $3.7 billion for Asset       \nManagement and approximately $0.7 billion for \nConsumer & Wealth Management, while attributed\nequity decreased by approximately $2.3 billion\nfor Global Markets and approximately $2.1     \nbillion for Investment Banking. On January 1, \n2022, our allocation of attributed equity     \nchanged (relative to the allocation as of     \nDecember 2021) as follows: attributed equity  \nincreased by approximately $1.0 billion for   \nConsumer & Wealth Management and approximately\n$0.5 billion for Investment Banking, while    \nattributed equity decreased by approximately  \n$0.8 billion for Global Markets and           \napproximately $0.7 billion for Asset          \nManagement. See \u201cSegment Assets and Operating \nResults \u2014 Segment Operating Results\u201d for      \ninformation about our average quarterly       \nattributed equity by segment. Share Repurchase\nProgram. We use our share repurchase program  \nto help maintain the appropriate level of     \ncommon equity. The repurchase program is      \neffected primarily through regular open-market\npurchases (which may include repurchase plans \ndesigned to comply with Rule 10b5-1and        \naccelerated share repurchases), the amounts   \nand timing of which are determined primarily  \nby our current and projected capital position \nand our capital plan submitted to the FRB as  \npart of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the   \nrepurchases may also be influenced by general \nmarket conditions and the prevailing price and\ntrading volumes of our common stock.          \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    83  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis In the   \nthird quarter of 2021, the Board of Directors \nof Group Inc. (Board) approved an increase in \nour common stock dividend from $1.25 to $2.00 \nper share. During the fourth quarter of 2021, \nwe returned a total of $1.20 billion to       \nshareholders, including common stock          \nrepurchases of $500 million and approximately \n$700 million in common stock dividends. We    \ncurrently expect our common stock repurchases \nin the first quarter of 2022 to be at or      \naround the levels of common stock repurchases \nin the fourth quarter of 2021. Consistent with\nour capital management philosophy, we will    \ncontinue prioritizing deployment of capital   \nfor our clients where returns are attractive  \nand return any excess capital to shareholders \nthrough dividends and share repurchases. As of\nDecember 2021, the remaining share            \nauthorization under our existing repurchase   \nprogram was 34.4 million shares.

In connection with \nour resolution planning efforts, we have      \nestablished a Resolution Capital Adequacy and \nPositioning framework, which is designed to   \nensure that our major subsidiaries (GS Bank   \nUSA, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI,   \nGSIB, GSBE, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.     \n(GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. \nand Goldman Sachs Asset Management            \nInternational) have access to sufficient loss-\nabsorbing capacity (in the form of equity,    \nsubordinated debt and unsecured senior debt)  \nso that they are able to wind-down following a\nGroup Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance    \nwith our preferred resolution strategy. In    \naddition, we have established a triggers and  \nalerts framework, which is designed to provide\nthe Board with information needed to make an  \ninformed decision on whether and when to      \ncommence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\nRating Agency Guidelines The credit rating    \nagencies assign credit ratings to the         \nobligations of Group Inc., which directly     \nissues or guarantees substantially all of our \nsenior unsecured debt obligations. GS&Co. and \nGSI have been assigned long- and short-term   \nissuer ratings by certain credit rating       \nagencies. GS Bank USA, GSIB and GSBE have also\nbeen assigned long- and short-term issuer     \nratings, as well as ratings on their long- and\nshort-term bank deposits. In addition, credit \nrating agencies have assigned ratings to debt \nobligations of certain other subsidiaries of  \nGroup Inc. The level and composition of our   \ncapital are among the many factors considered \nin determining our credit ratings. Each agency\nhas its own definition of eligible capital and\nmethodology for evaluating capital adequacy,  \nand assessments are generally based on a      \ncombination of factors rather than a single   \ncalculation. See \u201cRisk Management \u2014 Liquidity \nRisk Management \u2014 Credit Ratings\u201d for further \ninformation about credit ratings of Group     \nInc., GS Bank USA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&Co. and GSI.\nConsolidated Regulatory Capital We are subject\nto consolidated regulatory capital            \nrequirements which are calculated in          \naccordance with the regulations of the FRB    \n(Capital Framework). Under the Capital        \nFramework, we are an \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d      \nbanking organization and have been designated \nas a global systemically important bank       \n(G-SIB). The capital requirements calculated  \nunder the Capital Framework include the       \ncapital conservation buffer requirements,     \nwhich are comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under   \nthe Advanced Capital Rules), the SCB (under   \nthe Standardized Capital Rules), a            \ncountercyclical capital buffer (under both    \nCapital Rules) and the G-SIBsurcharge (under  \nboth Capital Rules). Our G-SIBsurcharge is    \n2.5% for 2021 and 2022 and 3.0% for 2023.     \nBased on financial data for 2021, we are above\nthe threshold for the 3.5% G-SIBsurcharge. The\nearliest this surcharge could be effective is \nJanuary 2024. The G-SIBsurcharge and          \ncountercyclical capital buffer in the future  \nmay differ due to additional guidance from our\nregulators and/or positional changes, and our \nSCB is likely to change from year to year     \nbased on the results of the annual supervisory\nstress tests. Our target is to maintain       \ncapital ratios equal to the regulatory        \nrequirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100 basis \npoints. See Note 20 to the consolidated       \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout our risk-based capital ratios and       \nleverage ratios, and the Capital Framework.   \nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) We are   \nalso subject to the FRB\u2019s TLAC and related    \nrequirements. Failure to comply with the TLAC \nand related requirements would result in      \nrestrictions being imposed by the FRB and     \ncould limit our ability to repurchase shares, \npay dividends and make certain discretionary  \ncompensation payments.                        \n                                      \n  84    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

These profits contributed           \napproximately 16 basis points to the CET1     \ncapital ratio. GSI is also subject to the     \nleverage ratio framework established by the   \nPRA. This framework sets the minimum leverage \nratio requirement at 3.25% that will apply to \nGSI from January 1, 2023. GSI had a leverage  \nratio of 4.2% as of December 2021 and 4.7% as \nof December 2020. The leverage ratio as of    \nDecember 2021 reflected GSI\u2019s profits after   \nforeseeable charges for the three months ended\nDecember 2021 (which will not be finalized    \nuntil verification by GSI\u2019s external auditors \nand approval by GSI\u2019s Board of Directors for  \ninclusion in risk-based capital). These       \nprofits contributed approximately 7 basis     \npoints to the leverage ratio.

See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in   \nPart I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Kfor further   \ninformation about the laws, rules and         \nregulations and proposed laws, rules and      \nregulations that apply to us and our          \noperations. Other Matters Replacement of      \nInterbank Offered Rates (IBORs), including    \nLIBOR. On January 1, 2022, the publication of \nall EUR, CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR (non-USDLIBOR)\nsettings along with certain USD LIBOR settings\nceased. The publication of the most commonly  \nused USD LIBOR settings will cease after June \n2023. The FCA has allowed the publication and \nuse of synthetic rates for certain GBP and JPY\nLIBOR settings in legacy GBP or JPY LIBOR-    \nbased derivative contracts through December   \n2022. The U.S. federal banking agencies\u2019      \nguidance strongly encourages banking          \norganizations to cease using USD LIBOR. The   \nInternational Swaps and Derivatives           \nAssociation (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks        \nProtocol (IBOR Protocol) has provided         \nderivatives market participants with amended  \nfallbacks for legacy and new derivative       \ncontracts to mitigate legal or economic       \nuncertainty. Both counterparties have to      \nadhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in      \nbilateral amendments for the terms to be      \neffective for derivative contracts. ISDA      \nconfirmed that the FCA\u2019s formal announcement  \nin March 2021 fixed the spread adjustment for \nall LIBOR rates and that fallbacks will       \nautomatically occur for outstanding derivative\ncontracts that incorporate the relevant terms.\nIn April 2021, the State of New York approved \nlegislation intended to minimize legal and    \neconomic uncertainty for contracts that are   \ngoverned by New York law and have no fallback \nprovisions or have fallback provisions that   \nare based on USD LIBOR by providing a         \nstatutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with \na benchmark rate based on the Secured         \nOvernight Financing Rate (SOFR). We have      \nfacilitated an orderly transition from non-   \nUSDLIBORs to alternative risk-free reference  \nrates for us and our clients and continue to  \nmake progress on our transition program as it \nrelates to USD LIBOR. Our non-USDLIBOR risk   \nexposure was substantially all in connection  \nwith derivative contracts. As of December     \n2021, substantially all of our non-USDLIBOR-  \nbased derivative contracts were with central  \nclearing counterparties or exchanges which had\nincorporated fallbacks consistent with the    \nIBOR Protocol in their rulebooks or were under\nbilateral agreements subject to the IBOR      \nProtocol. The remainder were converted to     \nsynthetic rates as permitted by the FCA. The  \nnotional amount of derivatives converted to   \nsynthetic rates was not material. Our risk    \nexposure to USD LIBOR is primarily in         \nconnection with our derivative contracts and  \nto a lesser extent our unsecured debt,        \npreferred stock and loan portfolio. As of     \nDecember 2021, the notional amount of our USD \nLIBOR-based derivative contracts was          \napproximately $10.0 trillion, of which        \napproximately $5.5 trillion will mature after \nJune 2023 based on their contractual terms. A \nmajority of such derivative contracts are with\ncounterparties under bilateral agreements     \nsubject to the IBOR Protocol, or with central \nclearing counterparties or exchanges which    \nhave incorporated fallbacks consistent with   \nthe IBOR Protocol in their rulebooks and have \nannounced that they plan to convert USD LIBOR \ncontracts to alternative risk-free reference  \nrates. Our benchmark unsecured debt and       \npreferred stock with USD LIBOR exposure was   \napproximately $34.5 billion as of December    \n2021, of which $29.4 billion will             \ncontractually mature after June 2023 or is    \nperpetual and has no stated maturity date. A  \nlarge portion of such debt and preferred stock\nrepresents our fixed-to-floatingrate          \ninstruments, currently in the fixed-rate      \nperiod, with call options before the LIBOR    \nexposure begins. We continue to monitor       \nindustry and legislative developments as they \nrelate to unsecured debt and preferred stock  \nand will take actions designed to facilitate  \nan orderly transition. In addition, we are    \nalso engaging with our clients in order to    \nremediate our loan agreements through         \nbilateral amendments. We have also issued debt\nand deposits linked to SOFR and Sterling      \nOvernight Index Average (SONIA) and executed  \nSOFR- and SONIA-based derivative contracts to \nmake markets and facilitate client activities.\nWhen appropriate, we continue to execute      \ntransactions in the market to reduce our USD  \nLIBOR exposures arising from hedges to our    \nfixed-rate debt issuances and replace them    \nwith alternative risk-free reference rate     \nexposures.                                    \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    87  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

For further information about our \nrisk management processes, see \u201cOverview and  \nStructure of Risk Management,\u201d and for        \ninformation about our areas of risk, see      \n\u201cLiquidity Risk Management,\u201d \u201cMarket Risk     \nManagement,\u201d \u201cCredit Risk Management,\u201d        \n\u201cOperational Risk Management\u201d and \u201cModel Risk \nManagement\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item\n1A of this Form 10-K. Overview and Structure  \nof Risk Management Overview We believe that   \neffective risk management is critical to our  \nsuccess. Accordingly, we have established an  \nenterprise risk management framework that     \nemploys a comprehensive, integrated approach  \nto risk management, and is designed to enable \ncomprehensive risk management processes       \nthrough which we identify, assess, monitor and\nmanage the risks we assume in conducting our  \nactivities. Our risk management structure is  \nbuilt around three core components:           \ngovernance, processes and people. Governance. \nRisk management governance starts with the    \nBoard, which both directly and through its    \ncommittees, including its Risk Committee,     \noversees our risk management policies and     \npractices implemented through the enterprise  \nrisk management framework. The Board is also  \nresponsible for the annual review and approval\nof our risk appetite statement. The risk      \nappetite statement describes the levels and   \ntypes of risk we are willing to accept or to  \navoid, in order to achieve our objectives     \nincluded in our strategic business plan, while\nremaining in compliance with regulatory       \nrequirements. The Board reviews our strategic \nbusiness plan and is ultimately responsible   \nfor overseeing and providing direction about  \nour strategy and risk appetite. The Board     \nreceives regular briefings on firmwide risks, \nincluding liquidity risk, market risk, credit \nrisk, operational risk and model risk, from   \nour independent risk oversight and control    \nfunctions, including the chief risk officer,  \nand on compliance risk and conduct risk from  \nCompliance, on legal and regulatory           \nenforcement matters from the chief legal      \nofficer, and on other matters impacting our   \nreputation from the chair of our Firmwide     \nClient and Business Standards Committee and   \nour Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The \nchief risk officer reports to our chief       \nexecutive officer and to the Risk Committee of\nthe Board. As part of the review of the       \nfirmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk       \nofficer regularly advises the Risk Committee  \nof the Board of relevant risk metrics and     \nmaterial exposures, including risk limits and \nthresholds established in our risk appetite   \nstatement. The implementation of our risk     \ngovernance structure and core risk management \nprocesses are overseen by Enterprise Risk,    \nwhich reports to our chief risk officer, and  \nis responsible for ensuring that our          \nenterprise risk management framework provides \nthe Board, our risk committees and senior     \nmanagement with a consistent and integrated   \napproach to managing our various risks in a   \nmanner consistent with our risk appetite. Our \nrevenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, \nEngineering, Human Capital Management,        \nOperations, and Corporate and Workplace       \nSolutions, are considered our first line of   \ndefense. They are accountable for the outcomes\nof our risk-generating activities, as well as \nfor assessing and managing those risks within \nour risk appetite. Our independent risk       \noversight and control functions are considered\nour second line of defense and provide        \nindependent assessment, oversight and         \nchallenge of the risks taken by our first line\nof defense, as well as lead and participate in\nrisk committees. Independent risk oversight   \nand control functions include Compliance,     \nConflicts Resolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk\nand Tax. Internal Audit is considered our     \nthird line of defense, and our director of    \nInternal Audit reports to the Audit Committee \nof the Board and administratively to our chief\nexecutive officer. Internal Audit includes    \nprofessionals with a broad range of audit and \nindustry experience, including risk management\nexpertise. Internal Audit is responsible for  \nindependently assessing and validating the    \neffectiveness of key controls, including those\nwithin the risk management framework, and     \nproviding timely reporting to the Audit       \nCommittee of the Board, senior management and \nregulators.                                   \n                                      \n  90    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

We have a    \n       comprehensive data collection          \n       process, including firmwide policies   \n       and procedures that require all        \n  \u2022    employees to report and escalate risk  \n       events.

As a global financial \ninstitution, climate-related risks manifest in\ndifferent ways across our businesses and we   \nhave continued to make significant            \nenhancements to our climate risk management   \nframework, including steps to further         \nintegrate climate into our broader risk       \nmanagement processes. We have integrated      \noversight of climate-related risks into our   \nrisk management governance structure, from    \nsenior management to our Board and its        \ncommittees, including the Risk and Public     \nResponsibilities Committees. The Risk         \nCommittee of the Board oversees firmwide      \nfinancial and nonfinancial risks, which       \ninclude climate risk, and, as part of its     \noversight, receives updates on our risk       \nmanagement approach to climate risk, including\nour approaches towards scenario analysis and  \nintegration into existing risk management     \nprocesses. The Public Responsibilities        \nCommittee of the Board assists the Board in   \nits oversight of our firmwide sustainability  \nstrategy and sustainability issues affecting  \nus, including with respect to climate change. \nAs part of its oversight, the Public          \nResponsibilities Committee receives periodic  \nupdates on our sustainability strategy, and   \nalso periodically reviews our governance and  \nrelated policies and processes for            \nsustainability and climate change-related     \nrisks. Senior management within Risk is       \nresponsible for the development of our climate\nrisk program. We have begun incorporating     \nclimate risk into our credit evaluation and   \nunderwriting processes for select industries. \nClimate risk factors are now evaluated as part\nof transaction due diligence for select loan  \ncommitments. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Sustainability\u201d  \nin Part I, Item 1 and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part  \nI, Item 1A of this Form 10-Kfor information   \nabout our sustainability initiatives,         \nincluding in relation to climate transition.  \nCompliance Risk Management Compliance risk is \nthe risk of legal or regulatory sanctions,    \nmaterial financial loss or damage to our      \nreputation arising from our failure to comply \nwith the requirements of applicable laws,     \nrules and regulations, and our internal       \npolicies and procedures. Compliance risk is   \ninherent in all activities through which we   \nconduct our businesses. Our Compliance Risk   \nManagement Program, administered by           \nCompliance, assesses our compliance,          \nregulatory and reputational risk; monitors for\ncompliance with new or amended laws, rules and\nregulations; designs and implements controls, \npolicies, procedures and training; conducts   \nindependent testing; investigates, surveils   \nand monitors for compliance risks and         \nbreaches; and leads our responses to          \nregulatory examinations, audits and inquiries.\nWe monitor and review business practices to   \nassess whether they meet or exceed minimum    \nregulatory and legal standards in all markets \nand jurisdictions in which we conduct         \nbusiness. Capital Risk Management Capital risk\nis the risk that our capital is insufficient  \nto support our business activities under      \nnormal and stressed market conditions or we   \nface capital reductions or RWA increases,     \nincluding from new or revised rules or changes\nin interpretations of existing rules, and are \ntherefore unable to meet our internal capital \ntargets or external regulatory capital        \nrequirements. Capital adequacy is of critical \nimportance to us. Accordingly, we have in     \nplace a comprehensive capital management      \npolicy that provides a framework, defines     \nobjectives and establishes guidelines to      \nmaintain an appropriate level and composition \nof capital in both business-as-usualand       \nstressed conditions. Our capital management   \nframework is designed to provide us with the  \ninformation needed to comprehensively manage  \nrisk, and develop and apply projected stress  \nscenarios that capture idiosyncratic          \nvulnerabilities with a goal of holding        \nsufficient capital to remain adequately       \ncapitalized even after experiencing a severe  \nstress event. See \u201cCapital Management and     \nRegulatory Capital\u201d for further information   \nabout our capital management process.         \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    95  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Our      \ncredit risk management systems capture credit \nexposure to individual counterparties and on  \nan aggregate basis to counterparties and their\nsubsidiaries. These systems also provide      \nmanagement with comprehensive information     \nabout our aggregate credit risk by product,   \ninternal credit rating, industry, country and \nregion. Risk Measures We measure our credit   \nrisk based on the potential loss in the event \nof non-paymentby a counterparty using current \nand potential exposure. For derivatives and   \nsecurities financing transactions, current    \nexposure represents the amount presently owed \nto us after taking into account applicable    \nnetting and collateral arrangements, while    \npotential exposure represents our estimate of \nthe future exposure that could arise over the \nlife of a transaction based on market         \nmovements within a specified confidence level.\nPotential exposure also takes into account    \nnetting and collateral arrangements. For loans\nand lending commitments, the primary measure  \nis a function of the notional amount of the   \nposition. Stress Tests We conduct regular     \nstress tests to calculate the credit          \nexposures, including potential concentrations \nthat would result from applying shocks to     \ncounterparty credit ratings or credit risk    \nfactors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates,\nequity prices). These shocks cover a wide     \nrange of moderate and more extreme market     \nmovements, including shocks to multiple risk  \nfactors, consistent with the occurrence of a  \nsevere market or economic event. In the case  \nof sovereign default, we estimate the direct  \nimpact of the default on our sovereign credit \nexposures, changes to our credit exposures    \narising from potential market moves in        \nresponse to the default, and the impact of    \ncredit market deterioration on corporate      \nborrowers and counterparties that may result  \nfrom the sovereign default. Unlike potential  \nexposure, which is calculated within a        \nspecified confidence level, stress testing    \ndoes not generally assume a probability of    \nthese events occurring. We also perform       \nfirmwide stress tests. See \u201cOverview and      \nStructure of Risk Management\u201d for information \nabout firmwide stress tests. To supplement    \nthese regular stress tests, as described      \nabove, we also conduct tailored stress tests  \non an ad hoc basis in response to specific    \nmarket events that we deem significant. We    \nalso utilize these stress tests to estimate   \nthe indirect impact of certain hypothetical   \nevents on our country exposures, such as the  \nimpact of credit market deterioration on      \ncorporate borrowers and counterparties along  \nwith the shocks to the risk factors described \nabove. The parameters of these shocks vary    \nbased on the scenario reflected in each stress\ntest. We review estimated losses produced by  \nthe stress tests in order to understand their \nmagnitude, highlight potential loss           \nconcentrations, and assess and mitigate our   \nexposures where necessary. Limits We use      \ncredit risk limits at various levels, as well \nas underwriting standards to manage the size  \nand nature of our credit exposures. Limits for\nindustries and countries are based on our risk\nappetite and are designed to allow for regular\nmonitoring, review, escalation and management \nof credit risk concentrations. See \u201cOverview  \nand Structure of Risk Management\u201d for         \ninformation about the limit approval process. \nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring     \nthese limits, and identifying and escalating  \nto senior management and/or the appropriate   \nrisk committee, on a timely basis, instances  \nwhere limits have been exceeded. Risk         \nMitigants To reduce our credit exposures on   \nderivatives and securities financing          \ntransactions, we may enter into netting       \nagreements with counterparties that permit us \nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. We may also reduce credit risk\nwith counterparties by entering into          \nagreements that enable us to obtain collateral\nfrom them on an upfront or contingent basis   \nand/or to terminate transactions if the       \ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating falls below a    \nspecified level. We monitor the fair value of \nthe collateral to ensure that our credit      \nexposures are appropriately collateralized. We\nseek to minimize exposures where there is a   \nsignificant positive correlation between the  \ncreditworthiness of our counterparties and the\nmarket value of collateral we receive. For    \nloans and lending commitments, depending on   \nthe credit quality of the borrower and other  \ncharacteristics of the transaction, we employ \na variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk   \nmitigants include collateral provisions,      \nguarantees, covenants, structural seniority of\nthe bank loan claims and, for certain lending \ncommitments, provisions in the legal          \ndocumentation that allow us to adjust loan    \namounts, pricing, structure and other terms as\nmarket conditions change. The type and        \nstructure of risk mitigants employed can      \nsignificantly influence the degree of credit  \nrisk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into\na counterparty\u2019s financial strength or when we\nbelieve a counterparty requires support from  \nits parent, we may obtain third-party         \nguarantees of the counterparty\u2019s obligations. \nWe may also mitigate our credit risk using    \ncredit derivatives or participation           \nagreements.                                   \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    107  \n                                       \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

The firm\u2019s  \ninternal control over financial reporting is a\nprocess designed under the supervision of the \nfirm\u2019s principal executive and principal      \nfinancial officers to provide reasonable      \nassurance regarding the reliability of        \nfinancial reporting and the preparation of the\nfirm\u2019s financial statements for external      \nreporting purposes in accordance with U.S.    \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. As  \nof December 31, 2021, management conducted an \nassessment of the firm\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on the framework    \nestablished in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated  \nFramework (2013)issued by the Committee of    \nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway      \nCommission (COSO). Based on this assessment,  \nmanagement has determined that the firm\u2019s     \ninternal control over financial reporting as  \nof December 31, 2021 was effective. Our       \ninternal control over financial reporting     \nincludes policies and procedures that pertain \nto the maintenance of records that, in        \nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly      \nreflect transactions and dispositions of      \nassets; provide reasonable assurance that     \ntransactions are recorded as necessary to     \npermit preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with U.S. generally accepted       \naccounting principles, and that receipts and  \nexpenditures are being made only in accordance\nwith authorizations of management and the     \ndirectors of the firm; and provide reasonable \nassurance regarding prevention or timely      \ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or \ndisposition of the firm\u2019s assets that could   \nhave a material effect on our financial       \nstatements.

Change in Accounting\nPrinciple As discussed in Note 3 to the       \nconsolidated financial statements, the Company\nchanged the manner in which it accounts for   \ncredit losses on certain financial instruments\nin 2020. Basis for Opinions The Company\u2019s     \nmanagement is responsible for these           \nconsolidated financial statements, for        \nmaintaining effective internal control over   \nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over    \nfinancial reporting, included in Management\u2019s \nReport on Internal Control over Financial     \nReporting appearing on page 117. Our          \nresponsibility is to express opinions on the  \nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements   \nand on the Company\u2019s internal control over    \nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We   \nare a public accounting firm registered with  \nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in    \naccordance with the U.S. federal securities   \nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations \nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and \nthe PCAOB. We conducted our audits in         \naccordance with the standards of the PCAOB.   \nThose standards require that we plan and      \nperform the audits to obtain reasonable       \nassurance about whether the consolidated      \nfinancial statements are free of material     \nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud,  \nand whether effective internal control over   \nfinancial reporting was maintained in all     \nmaterial respects. Our audits of the          \nconsolidated financial statements included    \nperforming procedures to assess the risks of  \nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated     \nfinancial statements, whether due to error or \nfraud, and performing procedures that respond \nto those risks. Such procedures included      \nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\nthe amounts and disclosures in the            \nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits \nalso included evaluating the accounting       \nprinciples used and significant estimates made\nby management, as well as evaluating the      \noverall presentation of the consolidated      \nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal   \ncontrol over financial reporting included     \nobtaining an understanding of internal control\nover financial reporting, assessing the risk  \nthat a material weakness exists, and testing  \nand evaluating the design and operating       \neffectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk. Our audits also included       \nperforming such other procedures as we        \nconsidered necessary in the circumstances.

Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods \nare subject to the risk that controls may     \nbecome inadequate because of changes in       \nconditions, or that the degree of compliance  \nwith the policies or procedures may           \ndeteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The       \ncritical audit matters communicated below are \nmatters arising from the current period audit \nof the consolidated financial statements that \nwere communicated or required to be           \ncommunicated to the audit committee and that  \n(i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial        \nstatements and (ii) involved our especially   \nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters   \ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the  \nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a \nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the   \ncritical audit matters below, providing       \nseparate opinions on the critical audit       \nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to  \nwhich they relate. Valuation of Certain Level \n3 Financial Instruments As described in Notes \n4 through 10 to the consolidated financial    \nstatements, as of December 31, 2021, the      \nCompany carries financial instruments at fair \nvalue, which includes $24.1 billion of        \nfinancial assets and $29.2 billion of         \nfinancial liabilities classified in Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, as one or more      \ninputs to the financial instrument\u2019s valuation\ntechnique are significant and unobservable.   \nSignificant unobservable inputs used by       \nmanagement to value certain of these Level 3  \nfinancial instruments included (i) industry   \nmultiples and public comparables, (ii) credit \nspreads or (iii) correlation. The principal   \nconsiderations for our determination that     \nperforming procedures relating to the         \nvaluation of these certain Level 3 financial  \ninstruments is a critical audit matter are (i)\nthe significant judgment by management in     \nvaluing the financial instruments, which in   \nturn led to a high degree of auditor judgment,\nsubjectivity, and effort in performing        \nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence      \nrelated to the aforementioned significant     \nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of  \ncertain Level 3 financial instruments, and    \n(ii) the audit effort involved the use of     \nprofessionals with specialized skill and      \nknowledge. Addressing the matter involved     \nperforming procedures and evaluating audit    \nevidence in connection with forming our       \noverall opinion on the consolidated financial \nstatements. These procedures included testing \nthe effectiveness of controls relating to the \nvaluation of financial instruments, including \ncontrols over the methods and significant     \nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of  \ncertain Level 3 financial instruments. These  \nprocedures also included, among others, for a \nsample of financial instruments, the          \ninvolvement of professionals with specialized \nskill and knowledge to assist in (i)          \ndeveloping an independent estimate of fair    \nvalue or (ii) testing management\u2019s process to \ndetermine the fair value of these financial   \ninstruments. Developing the independent       \nestimate involved (i) testing the completeness\nand accuracy of data provided by management,  \n(ii) evaluating and utilizing management\u2019s    \nsignificant unobservable inputs or developing \nindependent significant unobservable inputs,  \nand (iii) comparing management\u2019s estimate to  \nthe independently developed estimate of fair  \nvalue. Testing management\u2019s process included  \nevaluating the reasonableness of the          \naforementioned significant unobservable       \ninputs, evaluating the appropriateness of the \ntechniques used, and testing the completeness \nand accuracy of data used by management to    \ndetermine the fair value of these instruments.\n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    119  \n                                       \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Report of Independent Registered Public     \n  Accounting                                  \n  Firm                                        \n                                              \nAllowance for Loan Losses \u2014 Wholesale Loan    \nPortfolio As described in Note 9 to the       \nconsolidated financial statements, the        \nCompany\u2019s allowance for loan losses for the   \nwholesale loan portfolio reflects management\u2019s\nestimate of loan losses over the remaining    \nexpected life of the loans and also considers \nforecasts of future economic conditions. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, $2.1 billion of the        \nallowance for loan losses and $131.6 billion  \nof the loans accounted for at amortized cost  \nrelated to the wholesale loan portfolio. The  \nallowance for loan losses for the wholesale   \nloan portfolio is measured on a collective    \nbasis for loans that exhibit similar risk     \ncharacteristics using a modeled approach and  \nasset-specific basis for loans that do not    \nshare similar risk characteristics. In        \naddition, it includes qualitative components  \nto reflect the uncertain nature of economic   \nforecasting, capture uncertainty regarding    \nmodel inputs, and account for model           \nimprecision and concentration risk. The       \nwholesale models determine the probability of \ndefault and loss given default based on       \nvarious risk factors, including internal      \ncredit ratings, industry default and loss     \ndata, expected life, macroeconomic indicators,\nthe borrower\u2019s capacity to meet its financial \nobligations, the borrower\u2019s country of risk   \nand industry, loan seniority and collateral   \ntype. The most significant inputs to the      \nforecast model for wholesale loans include    \nforecasted U.S. unemployment rates, GDP,      \ncredit spreads, commercial and industrial     \ndelinquency rates, short- and long-term       \ninterest rates, and oil prices. The principal \nconsiderations for our determination that     \nperforming procedures relating to the         \nallowance for loan losses for the wholesale   \nloan portfolio is a critical audit matter are \n(i) the significant judgment and estimation by\nmanagement in the determinations of internal  \ncredit ratings and the forecasted U.S.        \nunemployment rates, which in turn led to a    \nhigh degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity,\nand effort in performing procedures and       \nevaluating audit evidence related to          \nmanagement\u2019s determinations, and (ii) the     \naudit effort involved the use of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge.         \nAddressing the matter involved performing     \nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in   \nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These  \nprocedures included testing the effectiveness \nof controls relating to the Company\u2019s         \nallowance for loan losses for the wholesale   \nloan portfolio, including controls over the   \nmodel, certain data, and significant          \nassumptions. These procedures also included,  \namong others, testing management\u2019s process for\nestimating the allowance for loan losses for  \nthe wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled  \napproach, which involved evaluating the       \nappropriateness of the methodology and testing\nthe completeness and accuracy of certain data \nused in estimating the allowance for loan     \nlosses. The procedures also involved the use  \nof professionals with specialized skill and   \nknowledge to assist in evaluating (i) the     \nappropriateness of the model and methodology  \nand (ii) the reasonableness of the internal   \ncredit ratings and the forecasted U.S.        \nunemployment rates used in estimating the     \nallowance for loan losses for the wholesale   \nloan portfolio. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York February 24, 2022 We have  \nserved as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1922.   \n                                       \n  120    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a      \nvoting interest entity or a variable interest \nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)   \nthe total equity investment at risk is        \nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity  \nholders have the power to direct the          \nactivities of the entity that most            \nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the    \nentity and the right to receive the residual  \nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting  \ninterest entity is ownership of a majority    \nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest \nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable  \nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that    \nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a \nvoting interest entity. The firm has a        \ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when  \nthe firm has a variable interest or interests \nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct  \nthe activities of the VIE that most           \nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic       \nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb \nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive     \nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially  \nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for    \nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method \nInvestments. When the firm does not have a    \ncontrolling financial interest in an entity   \nbut can exert significant influence over the  \nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair \nvalue by electing the fair value option       \navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant        \ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns \n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstancecommon stock. In certain cases, the  \nfirm applies the equity method of accounting  \nto new investments that are strategic in      \nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s       \nprincipal business activities, when the firm  \nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or   \nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less     \nsignificant. See Note 8 for further           \ninformation about equity-method investments.  \n                                       \n  126    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed         \ninvestment funds with third-party investors.  \nThese funds are typically organized as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies   \nfor which the firm acts as general partner or \nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a  \nmajority of the economic interests in these   \nfunds. These funds are usually voting interest\nentities and generally are not consolidated   \nbecause third-party investors typically have  \nrights to terminate the funds or to remove the\nfirm as general partner or manager.           \nInvestments in these funds are generally      \nmeasured at net asset value (NAV) and are     \nincluded in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and  \n22 for further information about investments  \nin funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of     \nthese consolidated financial statements       \nrequires management to make certain estimates \nand assumptions, the most important of which  \nrelate to fair value measurements, the        \nallowance for credit losses on loans and      \nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and accounting for income    \ntaxes. These estimates and assumptions are    \nbased on the best available information but   \nactual results could be materially different. \nRevenue Recognition Financial Assets and      \nLiabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and \nliabilities and certain investments are       \ncarried at fair value either under the fair   \nvalue option or in accordance with other U.S. \nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to    \naccount for certain of its loans and other    \nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nby electing the fair value option. The fair   \nvalue of a financial instrument is the amount \nthat would be received to sell an asset or    \npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly    \ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked \nto bid prices and financial liabilities are   \nmarked to offer prices. Fair value            \nmeasurements do not include transaction costs.\nFair value gains or losses are generally      \nincluded in market making or other principal  \ntransactions. See Note 4 for further          \ninformation about fair value measurements.    \nRevenue from Contracts with Clients. The firm \nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with \nclients for services, such as investment      \nbanking, investment management, and execution \nand clearing (contracts with clients), when   \nthe performance obligations related to the    \nunderlying transaction are completed. Revenues\nfrom contracts with clients represent         \napproximately 45% of total non-               \ninterestrevenues for both 2021 and 2020       \n(including approximately 90% of investment    \nbanking revenues, approximately 95% of        \ninvestment management revenues and all        \ncommissions and fees), and approximately 45%  \nof total non-interest revenues for 2019       \n(including approximately 85% of investment    \nbanking revenues, approximately 95% of        \ninvestment management revenues and all        \ncommissions and fees). See Note 25 for        \ninformation about net revenues by business    \nsegment. Investment Banking Advisory. Fees    \nfrom financial advisory assignments are       \nrecognized in revenues when the services      \nrelated to the underlying transaction are     \ncompleted under the terms of the assignment.  \nNon-refundabledeposits and milestone payments \nin connection with financial advisory         \nassignments are recognized in revenues upon   \ncompletion of the underlying transaction or   \nwhen the assignment is otherwise concluded.   \nExpenses associated with financial advisory   \nassignments are recognized when incurred and  \nare included in transaction based expenses.   \nClient reimbursements for such expenses are   \nincluded in investment banking revenues.      \nUnderwriting. Fees from underwriting          \nassignments are recognized in revenues upon   \ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses      \nassociated with underwriting assignments are  \ngenerally deferred until the related revenue  \nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise  \nconcluded. Such expenses are included in      \ntransaction based expenses for completed      \nassignments.                                  \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    127  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nInvestment Management The firm earns          \nmanagement fees and incentive fees for        \ninvestment management services, which are     \nincluded in investment management revenues.   \nThe firm makes payments to brokers and        \nadvisors related to the placement of the      \nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),  \nwhich are included in transaction based       \nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily net asset value and are received        \nmonthly. Management fees for hedge funds and  \nseparately managed accounts are calculated as \na percentage of month-endnet asset value and  \nare generally received quarterly. Management  \nfees for private equity funds are calculated  \nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are received quarterly, \nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the   \nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.      \nDistribution fees paid by the firm are        \ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net     \nasset value or the committed capital. Such    \nfees are included in transaction based        \nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are  \ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or     \nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other   \nperformance target. Incentive fees are        \ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a   \nfund. Fees that are based on performance over \na twelve-month period are subject to          \nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment \nperformance over the life of the fund, future \ninvestment underperformance may require fees  \npreviously distributed to the firm to be      \nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned   \nfrom a fund or separately managed account are \nrecognized when it is probable that a         \nsignificant reversal of such fees will not    \noccur, which is generally when such fees are  \nno longer subject to fluctuations in the      \nmarket value of investments held by the fund  \nor separately managed account. Therefore,     \nincentive fees recognized during the period   \nmay relate to performance obligations         \nsatisfied in previous periods. Commissions and\nFees The firm earns commissions and fees from \nexecuting and clearing client transactions on \nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter(OTC) transactions.           \nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides \nthird-party research services to clients in   \nconnection with certain soft-dollar           \narrangements. Third-party research costs      \nincurred by the firm in connection with such  \narrangements are presented net within         \ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance   \nObligations Remaining performance obligations \nare services that the firm has committed to   \nperform in the future in connection with its  \ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining  \nperformance obligations are generally related \nto its financial advisory assignments and     \ncertain investment management activities.     \nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory    \nassignments cannot be determined until the    \noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s    \ninvestment management activities, where fees  \nare calculated based on the net asset value of\nthe fund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining       \nperformance obligations cannot be determined  \nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in   \nthe market value of investments held by the   \nfund or separately managed account. The firm  \nis able to determine the future revenues      \nassociated with management fees calculated    \nbased on committed capital. As of December    \n2021, substantially all future net revenues   \nassociated with such remaining performance    \nobligations will be recognized through 2029.  \nAnnual revenues associated with such          \nperformance obligations average less than $   \n250million through 2029. Transfers of         \nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has  \nrelinquished control over the assets          \ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses   \nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or     \nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s        \ncontinuing involvement with transferred       \nfinancial assets are initially recognized at  \nfair value. For transfers of financial assets \nthat are not accounted for as sales, the      \nassets are generally included in trading      \nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a \ncollateralized financing, with the related    \ninterest expense recognized over the life of  \nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further      \ninformation about transfers of financial      \nassets accounted for as collateralized        \nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted \nfor as sales.                                 \n                                       \n  128    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nCash and Cash Equivalents The firm defines    \ncash equivalents as highly liquid overnight   \ndeposits held in the ordinary course of       \nbusiness. Cash and cash equivalents included  \ncash and due from banks of $ 10.14billion as  \nof December 2021 and $ 11.95billion as of     \nDecember 2020. Cash and cash equivalents also \nincluded interest-bearing deposits with banks \nof $ 250.90billion as of December 2021 and $  \n143.89billion as of December 2020. The firm   \nsegregates cash for regulatory and other      \npurposes related to client activity. Cash and \ncash equivalents segregated for regulatory and\nother purposes were $ 24.87billion as of      \nDecember 2021 and $ 24.52billion as of        \nDecember 2020. In addition, the firm          \nsegregates securities for regulatory and other\npurposes related to client activity. See Note \n11 for further information about segregated   \nsecurities. Customer and Other Receivables    \nCustomer and other receivables included       \nreceivables from customers and counterparties \nof $ 103.82billion as of December 2021 and $  \n82.39billion as of December 2020, and         \nreceivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations of $ 56.85billion as of December\n2021 and $ 38.94billion as of December 2020.  \nSuch receivables primarily consist of customer\nmargin loans, receivables resulting from      \nunsettled transactions and collateral posted  \nin connection with certain derivative         \ntransactions. Substantially all of these      \nreceivables are accounted for at amortized    \ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,  \nwhich generally approximates fair value. As   \nthese receivables are not accounted for at    \nfair value, they are not included in the      \nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through\n10. Had these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of   \nboth December 2021 and December 2020. See Note\n10 for further information about customer and \nother receivables accounted for at fair value \nunder the fair value option. Interest on      \ncustomer and other receivables is recognized  \nover the life of the transaction and included \nin interest income. Customer and other        \nreceivables includes receivables from         \ncontracts with clients and contract assets.   \nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to \nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s    \nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n3.01billion as of December 2021 and $         \n2.60billion as of December 2020. As of both   \nDecember 2021 and December 2020 contract      \nassets were not material. Customer and Other  \nPayables Customer and other payables included \npayables to customers and counterparties of $ \n241.93billion as of December 2021 and $       \n183.57billion as of December 2020, and        \npayables to brokers, dealers and clearing     \norganizations of $ 10.00billion as of December\n2021 and $ 7.09billion as of December 2020.   \nSuch payables primarily consist of customer   \ncredit balances related to the firm\u2019s prime   \nbrokerage activities. Customer and other      \npayables are accounted for at cost plus       \naccrued interest, which generally approximates\nfair value. As these payables are not         \naccounted for at fair value, they are not     \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 through 10. Had these payables been   \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,  \nsubstantially all would have been classified  \nin level 2 as of both December 2021 and       \nDecember 2020. Interest on customer and other \npayables is recognized over the life of the   \ntransaction and included in interest expense. \nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities To reduce   \ncredit exposures on derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter    \ninto master netting agreements or similar     \narrangements (collectively, netting           \nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a      \ncontract with a counterparty that permits net \nsettlement of multiple transactions with that \ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of  \ntermination rights by a non-defaultingparty.  \nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all \ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is \ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with     \nrespect to its derivatives and securities     \nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms  \nof the related credit support agreements or   \nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit    \nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit    \nsupport agreement grants the non-             \ndefaultingparty exercising termination rights \nthe right to liquidate the collateral and     \napply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In    \norder to assess enforceability of the firm\u2019s  \nright of setoff under netting and credit      \nsupport agreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in   \nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the        \nagreement.                                    \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    129  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Recent Accounting Developments        \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial     \nInstruments (ASC 326). In June 2016, the FASB \nissued ASU No. 2016-13,\u201cFinancial Instruments \n\u2014 Credit Losses (Topic 326) \u2014 Measurement of  \nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d This \nASU amends several aspects of the measurement \nof credit losses on certain financial         \ninstruments, including replacing the existing \nincurred credit loss model and other models   \nwith the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL)\nmodel and amending certain aspects of         \naccounting for purchased financial assets with\ndeterioration in credit quality since         \norigination. The firm adopted this ASU in     \nJanuary 2020 under a modified retrospective   \napproach. As a result of adopting this ASU,   \nthe firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses on     \nfinancial assets and commitments that are     \nmeasured at amortized cost reflects           \nmanagement\u2019s estimate of credit losses over   \nthe remaining expected life of such assets.   \nExpected credit losses for newly recognized   \nfinancial assets and commitments, as well as  \nchanges to expected credit losses during the  \nperiod, are recognized in earnings. These     \nexpected credit losses are measured based on  \nhistorical experience, current conditions and \nforecasts that affect the collectability of   \nthe reported amount. The cumulative effect of \nmeasuring the allowance under CECL as a result\nof adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020 was\nan increase in the allowance for credit losses\nof $ 848million. The increase in the allowance\nis driven by the fact that the allowance under\nCECL covers expected credit losses over the   \nfull expected life of the loan portfolios and \nalso takes into account forecasts of expected \nfuture economic conditions. In addition, in   \naccordance with the ASU, the firm elected the \nfair value option for loans that were         \npreviously accounted for as Purchased Credit  \nImpaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease  \nto the allowance for PCI loans of $           \n169million. The cumulative effect of adopting \nthis ASU was a decrease to retained earnings  \nof $ 638million (net of tax). Facilitation of \nthe Effects of Reference Rate Reform on       \nFinancial Reporting (ASC 848). In March 2020, \nthe FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04,\u201cReference    \nRate Reform \u2014 Facilitation of the Effects of  \nReference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\u201d\nThis ASU provides optional relief from        \napplying generally accepted accounting        \nprinciples to contracts, hedging relationships\nand other transactions affected by reference  \nrate reform. In addition, in January 2021 the \nFASB issued ASU No. 2021-01,\u201cReference Rate   \nReform \u2014 Scope,\u201d which clarified the scope of \nASC 848 relating to contract modifications.   \nThe firm adopted these ASUs upon issuance and \nelected to apply the relief available to      \ncertain modified derivatives. The adoption of \nthese ASUs did not have a material impact on  \nthe firm\u2019s consolidated financial statements. \n                                       \n  130    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value Measurements The fair value\nof a financial instrument is the amount that  \nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid      \nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not  \ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures  \ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a \nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to \nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active  \nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by    \nreference to prices for similar instruments,  \nquoted prices or recent transactions in less  \nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or            \nindependently sourced inputs, including, but  \nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities, \nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding  \nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference       \nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower \ncould finance a given financial instrument    \nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.  \nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for          \ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This   \nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation \ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving \nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based \non the lowest level of input that is          \nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In \nevaluating the significance of a valuation    \ninput, the firm considers, among other        \nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to   \nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as    \nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical, \nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.  \nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are       \nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values \nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial \nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain  \nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and      \nliabilities may require valuation adjustments \nthat a market participant would require to    \narrive at fair value for factors, such as     \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,   \nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments  \nare generally based on market evidence. The   \nvaluation techniques and nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair value of the\nfirm\u2019s financial instruments are described    \nbelow. See Notes 5 through 10 for further     \ninformation about significant unobservable    \ninputs used to value level 3 financial        \ninstruments. Valuation Techniques and         \nSignificant Inputs for Trading Cash           \nInstruments, Investments and Loans Level 1.   \nLevel 1 instruments include U.S. government   \nobligations, most non-U.S.government          \nobligations, certain agency obligations,      \ncertain corporate debt instruments, certain   \nmoney market instruments and actively traded  \nlisted equities. These instruments are valued \nusing quoted prices for identical unrestricted\ninstruments in active markets. The firm       \ndefines active markets for equity instruments \nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market  \ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm   \ndefines active markets for debt instruments   \nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity. \nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain  \nnon-U.S.government obligations, most agency   \nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and   \nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,  \nmost state and municipal obligations, most    \nmoney market instruments, most other debt     \nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed \nequities, certain private equities,           \ncommodities and certain lending commitments.  \nValuations of level 2 instruments can be      \nverified to quoted prices, recent trading     \nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative    \npricing sources with reasonable levels of     \nprice transparency. Consideration is given to \nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor executable) and the relationship of recent \nmarket activity to the prices provided from   \nalternative pricing sources.                  \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    131  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Price\ntransparency of\nderivatives can\ngenerally be\ncharacterized by\nproduct type, as\ndescribed below.\n                                              \n       Interest Rate.In general, the key      \n       inputs used to value interest rate     \n       derivatives are transparent, even for  \n       most long-dated contracts. Interest    \n       rate swaps and options denominated in  \n       the currencies of leading              \n       industrialized nations are             \n  \u2022    characterized by high trading volumes  \n       and tight bid/offer spreads. Interest  \n       rate derivatives that reference        \n       indices, such as an inflation index,   \n       or the shape of the yield curve        \n       (e.g.,10-yearswap rate vs.2-yearswap   \n       rate) are more complex, but the key    \n       inputs are generally observable.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit.Price transparency for credit   \n       default swaps, including both single   \n       names and baskets of credits, varies   \n       by market and underlying reference     \n       entity or obligation. Credit default   \n       swaps that reference indices, large    \n       corporates and major sovereigns        \n       generally exhibit the most price       \n       transparency. For credit default       \n       swaps with other underliers, price     \n       transparency varies based on credit    \n       rating, the cost of borrowing the      \n       underlying reference obligations, and  \n  \u2022    the availability of the underlying     \n       reference obligations for delivery     \n       upon the default of the issuer.        \n       Credit default swaps that reference    \n       loans, asset-backed securities and     \n       emerging market debt instruments tend  \n       to have less price transparency than   \n       those that reference corporate bonds.  \n       In addition, more complex credit       \n       derivatives, such as those sensitive   \n       to the correlation between two or      \n       more underlying reference              \n       obligations, generally have less       \n       price transparency.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Currency.Prices for currency           \n       derivatives based on the exchange      \n       rates of leading industrialized        \n       nations, including those with longer   \n       tenors, are generally transparent.     \n  \u2022    The primary difference between the     \n       price transparency of developed and    \n       emerging market currency derivatives   \n       is that emerging markets tend to be    \n       only observable for contracts with     \n       shorter tenors.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Commodity.Commodity derivatives        \n       include transactions referenced to     \n       energy (e.g., oil, natural gas and     \n       electricity), metals (e.g., precious   \n       and base) and soft commodities (e.g.,  \n       agricultural). Price transparency      \n       varies based on the underlying         \n  \u2022    commodity, delivery location, tenor    \n       and product quality (e.g., diesel      \n       fuel compared to unleaded gasoline).   \n       In general, price transparency for     \n       commodity derivatives is greater for   \n       contracts with shorter tenors and      \n       contracts that are more closely        \n       aligned with major and/or benchmark    \n       commodity indices.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Equity.Price transparency for equity   \n       derivatives varies by market and       \n       underlier. Options on indices and the  \n       common stock of corporates included    \n       in major equity indices exhibit the    \n       most price transparency. Equity        \n       derivatives generally have observable  \n  \u2022    market prices, except for contracts    \n       with long tenors or reference prices   \n       that differ significantly from         \n       current market prices. More complex    \n       equity derivatives, such as those      \n       sensitive to the correlation between   \n       two or more individual stocks,         \n       generally have less price              \n       transparency.                          \n                                              \nLiquidity is essential                        \nto observability of all                       \nproduct types.

For example,  \n       the highest recovery rate for          \n       corporate debt instruments is          \n  \u2022    appropriate for valuing a specific     \n       corporate debt instrument, but may     \n       not be appropriate for valuing any     \n       other corporate debt instrument.       \n       Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do   \n       not represent uncertainty in, or       \n       possible ranges of, fair value         \n       measurements of level\u00a03 trading cash   \n       instruments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increases in yield, duration or        \n       cumulative loss rate used in the       \n       valuation of level\u00a03 trading cash      \n       instruments would have resulted in a   \n       lower fair value measurement, while    \n       increases in recovery rate would have  \n  \u2022    resulted in a higher fair value        \n       measurement as of both December\u00a02021   \n       and December\u00a02020.

Note 7. Derivatives and Hedging \nActivities Derivative Activities Derivatives  \nare instruments that derive their value from  \nunderlying asset prices, indices, reference   \nrates and other inputs, or a combination of   \nthese factors. Derivatives may be traded on an\nexchange (exchange-traded) or they may be     \nprivately negotiated contracts, which are     \nusually referred to as OTC derivatives.       \nCertain of the firm\u2019s OTC derivatives are     \ncleared and settled through central clearing  \ncounterparties (OTC-cleared),while others are \nbilateral contracts between two counterparties\n(bilateral OTC).                              \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    139  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

As a\nmarket maker, the firm\nenters into derivative\ntransactions to\nprovide liquidity to\nclients and to\nfacilitate the\ntransfer and hedging\nof their risks. In\nthis role, the firm\ntypically acts as\nprincipal and is\nrequired to commit\ncapital to provide\nexecution, and\nmaintains market-\nmaking positions in\nresponse to, or in\nanticipation of,\nclient demand.\n\nRisk Management. The\nfirm also enters into\nderivatives to\nactively manage risk\nexposures that arise\nfrom its market-making\nand investing and\nfinancing activities.\nThe firm\u2019s holdings\nand exposures are\nhedged, in many cases,\non either a portfolio\nor risk-specific\nbasis, as opposed to\nan instrument-by-\ninstrument basis. The\noffsetting impact of\nthis economic hedging\nis reflected in the\nsame business segment\nas the related\nrevenues. In addition,\nthe firm may enter\ninto derivatives\ndesignated as hedges\nunder U.S. GAAP. These\nderivatives are used\nto manage interest\nrate exposure of\ncertain fixed-rate\nunsecured borrowings\nand deposits, foreign\nexchange risk of\ncertain available-for-\nsale securities and\nthe net investment in\ncertain\nnon-U.S.operations,\nand the price risk of\ncertain commodities.\n\nThe firm enters into\nvarious types of\nderivatives,\nincluding:\n                                              \n       Futures and Forwards.Contracts that    \n       commit counterparties to purchase or   \n  \u2022    sell financial instruments,            \n       commodities or currencies in the       \n       future.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Swaps.Contracts that require           \n       counterparties to exchange cash        \n       flows, such as currency or interest    \n       payment streams. The amounts           \n  \u2022    exchanged are based on the specific    \n       terms of the contract with reference   \n       to specified rates, financial          \n       instruments, commodities, currencies   \n       or indices.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Options.Contracts in which the option  \n       purchaser has the right, but not the   \n       obligation, to purchase from or sell   \n  \u2022    to the option writer financial         \n       instruments, commodities or            \n       currencies within a defined time       \n       period for a specified price.          \n                                              \nDerivatives are\nreported on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for\nderivative assets and\nliabilities for a\ngiven counterparty)\nwhen a legal right of\nsetoff exists under an\nenforceable netting\nagreement\n(counterparty\nnetting).

An average      \n       greater than the median indicates      \n  \u2022    that the majority of inputs are below  \n       the average. For example, the          \n       difference between the average and     \n       the median for credit spreads          \n       indicates that the majority of the     \n       inputs fall in the lower end of the    \n       range.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       The ranges, averages and medians of    \n       these inputs are not representative    \n       of the appropriate inputs to use when  \n       calculating the fair value of any one  \n       derivative. For example, the highest   \n       correlation for interest rate          \n       derivatives is appropriate for         \n  \u2022    valuing a specific interest rate       \n       derivative but may not be appropriate  \n       for valuing any other interest rate    \n       derivative. Accordingly, the ranges    \n       of inputs do not represent             \n       uncertainty in, or possible ranges     \n       of, fair value measurements of level\u00a0  \n       3 derivatives.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Interest rates, currencies and         \n       equities derivatives are valued using  \n       option pricing models, credit          \n       derivatives are valued using option    \n  \u2022    pricing, correlation and discounted    \n       cash flow models, and commodities      \n       derivatives are valued using option    \n       pricing and discounted cash flow       \n       models.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       The fair value of any one instrument   \n       may be determined using multiple       \n       valuation techniques. For example,     \n  \u2022    option pricing models and discounted   \n       cash flow models are typically used    \n       together to determine fair value.      \n       Therefore, the level\u00a03 balance         \n       encompasses both of these techniques.  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Correlation within currencies and      \n  \u2022    equities includes cross-product type   \n       correlation.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Natural gas spread represents the      \n  \u2022    spread per\u00a0million British thermal     \n       units of natural gas.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Oil spread represents the spread per   \n       barrel of oil and refined products.    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Electricity price represents the       \n  \u2022    price per megawatt hour of             \n       electricity.                           \n                                              \nRange of Significant                          \nUnobservable Inputs                           \nThe following provides\ninformation about the\nranges of significant\nunobservable inputs\nused to value the\nfirm\u2019s level\u00a03\nderivative instruments:\n                                              \n       Correlation.Ranges for correlation     \n       cover a variety of underliers both     \n       within one product type (e.g., equity  \n       index and equity single stock names)   \n       and across product types (e.g.,        \n       correlation of an interest rate and a  \n  \u2022    currency), as well as across regions.  \n       Generally, cross-product type          \n       correlation inputs are used to value   \n       more complex instruments and are       \n       lower than correlation inputs on       \n       assets within the same derivative      \n       product type.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Volatility.Ranges for volatility       \n       cover numerous underliers across a     \n       variety of markets, maturities and     \n  \u2022    strike prices.

Credit\nderivatives are\nactively managed based\non the firm\u2019s net risk\nposition. Credit\nderivatives are\ngenerally individually\nnegotiated contracts\nand can have various\nsettlement and payment\nconventions. Credit\nevents include failure\nto pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of\nindebtedness,\nrestructuring,\nrepudiation and\ndissolution of the\nreference entity.\n\nThe firm enters into\nthe following types of\ncredit derivatives:\n                                              \n       Credit Default Swaps.Single-name       \n       credit default swaps protect the       \n       buyer against the loss of principal    \n       on one or more bonds, loans or         \n       mortgages (reference obligations) in   \n       the event the issuer of the reference  \n       obligations suffers a credit event.    \n       The buyer of protection pays an        \n       initial or periodic premium to the     \n  \u2022    seller and receives protection for     \n       the period of the contract. If there   \n       is no credit event, as defined in the  \n       contract, the seller of protection     \n       makes no payments to the buyer. If a   \n       credit event occurs, the seller of     \n       protection is required to make a       \n       payment to the buyer, calculated       \n       according to the terms of the          \n       contract.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit Options.In a credit option,     \n       the option writer assumes the          \n       obligation to purchase or sell a       \n       reference obligation at a specified    \n       price or credit spread. The option     \n       purchaser buys the right, but does     \n  \u2022    not assume the obligation, to sell     \n       the reference obligation to, or        \n       purchase it from, the option writer.   \n       The payments on credit options depend  \n       either on a particular credit spread   \n       or the price of the reference          \n       obligation.                            \n                                              \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    145  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n                                              \n       Credit Indices, Baskets and            \n       Tranches.Credit derivatives may        \n       reference a basket of single-name      \n       credit default swaps or a broad-based  \n       index. If a credit event occurs in     \n       one of the underlying reference        \n       obligations, the protection seller     \n       pays the protection buyer. The         \n       payment is typically apro-rataportion  \n       of the transaction\u2019s total notional    \n  \u2022    amount based on the underlying         \n       defaulted reference obligation. In     \n       certain transactions, the credit risk  \n       of a basket or index is separated      \n       into various portions (tranches),      \n       each having different levels of        \n       subordination. The most junior         \n       tranches cover initial defaults and    \n       once losses exceed the notional        \n       amount of these junior tranches, any   \n       excess loss is covered by the next     \n       most senior tranche.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Total Return Swaps.A total return      \n       swap transfers the risks relating to   \n       economic performance of a reference    \n       obligation from the protection buyer   \n       to the protection seller. Typically,   \n       the protection buyer receives a        \n  \u2022    floating rate of interest and          \n       protection against any reduction in    \n       fair value of the reference            \n       obligation, and the protection seller  \n       receives the cash flows associated     \n       with the reference obligation, plus    \n       any increase in the fair value of the  \n       reference obligation.                  \n                                              \nThe firm economically\nhedges its exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a\nparticular written\ncredit derivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default.\n\nAs of December\u00a02021,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $ 510.24\nbillion and purchased\ncredit derivatives had\na total gross notional\namount of $ 569.34\nbillion, for total net\nnotional purchased\nprotection of $ 59.10\nbillion.

Credit\nfunds generally invest in loans and other     \nfixed income instruments and are focused on   \nproviding private high-yield capital for      \nleveraged and management buyout transactions, \nrecapitalizations, financings, refinancings,  \nacquisitions and restructurings for private   \nequity firms, private family companies and    \ncorporate issuers. Real estate funds invest   \nglobally, primarily in real estate companies, \nloan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and   \nproperty. Private equity, credit and real     \nestate funds are closed-endfunds in which the \nfirm\u2019s investments are generally not eligible \nfor redemption. Distributions will be received\nfrom these funds as the underlying assets are \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. The firm also invests in hedge  \nfunds, primarily multi-disciplinary hedge     \nfunds that employ a fundamental bottom-       \nupinvestment approach across various asset    \nclasses and strategies. The firm\u2019s investments\nin hedge funds primarily include interests    \nwhere the underlying assets are illiquid in   \nnature, and proceeds from redemptions will not\nbe received until the underlying assets are   \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. Private equity and hedge funds  \ndescribed above are primarily \u201ccovered funds\u201d \nas defined in the Volcker Rule of the U.S.    \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer    \nProtection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Substantially\nall of the credit and real estate funds       \ndescribed above are not covered funds. The    \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve     \nSystem (FRB) extended the conformance period  \nto July 2022 for the firm\u2019s investments in,   \nand relationships with, certain legacy        \n\u201cilliquid funds\u201d (as defined in the Volcker   \nRule) that were in place prior to December    \n2013. This extension is applicable to         \nsubstantially all of the firm\u2019s remaining     \ninvestments in, and relationships with, such  \ncovered funds. As of December 2021, the firm\u2019s\ntotal investments in funds at NAV of $        \n3.47billion included $ 903 million of         \ninvestments in covered funds for which        \ncompliance with the Volcker Rule will need to \nbe achieved by July 2022. The firm expects to \nachieve compliance for these covered funds    \nthrough ongoing harvesting of underlying fund \ninvestments in the ordinary course or through \nstructural modifications to these funds. To   \nthe extent that the firm is not able to       \nachieve compliance through these measures, the\nfirm will be required to sell its interests in\nsuch funds by July 2022.

Accordingly, the ranges of   \n       inputs do not represent uncertainty    \n       in, or possible ranges of, fair value  \n       measurements of level\u00a03 investments.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increases in yield, discount rate,     \n       capitalization rate or duration used   \n       in the valuation of level\u00a03            \n       investments would have resulted in a   \n       lower fair value measurement, while    \n       increases in recovery rate or          \n  \u2022    multiples would have resulted in a     \n       higher fair value measurement as of    \n       both December\u00a02021 and December\u00a02020.  \n       Due to the distinctive nature of each  \n       level\u00a03 investment, the                \n       interrelationship of inputs is not     \n       necessarily uniform within each        \n       product type.                          \n                                              \n                                       \n  152    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

\nNonaccrual and Past Due\nLoans. Loans accounted\nfor at amortized cost\n(other than credit card\nloans) are placed on\nnonaccrual status when\nit is probable that the\nfirm will not collect\nall principal and\ninterest due under the\ncontractual terms,\nregardless of the\ndelinquency status or\nif a loan is past due\nfor 90 days or more,\nunless the loan is both\nwell collateralized and\nin the process of\ncollection. At that\ntime, all accrued but\nuncollected interest is\nreversed against\ninterest income and\ninterest subsequently\ncollected is recognized\non a cash basis to the\nextent the loan balance\nis deemed collectible.\nOtherwise, all cash\nreceived is used to\nreduce the outstanding\nloan balance. A loan is\nconsidered past due\nwhen a principal or\ninterest payment has\nnot been made according\nto its contractual\nterms. Credit card\nloans are not placed on\nnonaccrual status and\naccrue interest until\nthe loan is paid in\nfull or is charged off.\n\nIn certain\ncircumstances, the firm\nmay modify the original\nterms of a loan\nagreement by granting a\nconcession to a\nborrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty,\ntypically in the form\nof a modification of\nloan covenants, but may\nalso include\nforbearance of interest\nor principal, payment\nextensions or interest\nrate reductions. These\nmodifications, to the\nextent significant, are\nconsidered troubled\ndebt restructurings\n(TDRs). Loan\nmodifications that\nextend payment terms\nfor a period of less\nthan 90\u00a0days are\ngenerally considered\ninsignificant and\ntherefore not reported\nas TDRs.\n\nThe firm adopted the\nrelief issued under the\nCoronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic\nSecurity Act (CARES\nAct), as amended, and\ncertain interpretive\nguidance issued by the\nU.S. banking agencies\nthat provides for\ncertain modified loans\nthat would otherwise\nmeet the definition of\na TDR to not be\nclassified as such.\nLoans accounted for at\namortized cost that\nwere not classified as\nTDRs as a result of\nthis relief and\ninterpretive guidance\nwere $ 166 million as\nof December\u00a02021 and\nwere $ 184 million as\nof December\u00a02020.

To determine the \nallowance for credit losses, the firm         \nclassifies its loans and lending commitments  \naccounted for at amortized cost into wholesale\nand consumer portfolios. These portfolios     \nrepresent the level at which the firm has     \ndeveloped and documented its methodology to   \ndetermine the allowance for credit losses. The\nallowance for credit losses is measured on a  \ncollective basis for loans that exhibit       \nsimilar risk characteristics using a modeled  \napproach and asset-specific basis for loans   \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics. The allowance for credit     \nlosses takes into account the weighted average\nof a range of forecasts of future economic    \nconditions over the expected life of the loan \nand lending commitments. The expected life of \neach loan or lending commitment is determined \nbased on the contractual term adjusted for    \nextension options or demand features, or is   \nmodeled in the case of revolving credit card  \nloans. The forecasts include baseline,        \nfavorable and adverse economic scenarios over \na three-year period. For loans with expected  \nlives beyond three years, the model reverts to\nhistorical loss information based on a non-   \nlinearmodeled approach. The forecasted        \neconomic scenarios consider a number of risk  \nfactors relevant to the wholesale and consumer\nportfolios described below. The firm applies  \njudgment in weighing individual scenarios each\nquarter based on a variety of factors,        \nincluding the firm\u2019s internally derived       \neconomic outlook, market consensus, recent    \nmacroeconomic conditions and industry trends. \nThe allowance for credit losses also includes \nqualitative components which allow management \nto reflect the uncertain nature of economic   \nforecasting, capture uncertainty regarding    \nmodel inputs, and account for model           \nimprecision and concentration risk.           \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    159  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The allowance   \nfor credit losses for wholesale loans and     \nlending commitments that exhibit similar risk \ncharacteristics is measured using a modeled   \napproach. These models determine the          \nprobability of default and loss given default \nbased on various risk factors, including      \ninternal credit ratings, industry default and \nloss data, expected life, macroeconomic       \nindicators, the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet   \nits financial obligations, the borrower\u2019s     \ncountry of risk and industry, loan seniority  \nand collateral type. For lending commitments, \nthe methodology also considers probability of \ndrawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans  \nbacked by real estate, risk factors include   \nthe loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio   \nand home price index. The most significant    \ninputs to the forecast model for wholesale    \nloans and lending commitments include         \nunemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads,      \ncommercial and industrial delinquency rates,  \nshort- and long-term interest rates, and oil  \nprices. The allowance for loan losses for     \nwholesale loans that do not share similar risk\ncharacteristics, such as nonaccrual loans or  \nloans in a TDR, is calculated using the       \npresent value of expected future cash flows   \ndiscounted at the loan\u2019s original effective   \nrate, the observable market price of the loan \nor the fair value of the collateral. Wholesale\nloans are charged off against the allowance   \nfor loan losses when deemed to be             \nuncollectible. Consumer. The allowance for    \ncredit losses for consumer loans that exhibit \nsimilar risk characteristics is calculated    \nusing a modeled approach which classifies     \nconsumer loans into pools based on borrower-  \nrelated and exposure-related characteristics  \nthat differentiate a pool\u2019s risk              \ncharacteristics from other pools. The factors \nconsidered in determining a pool are generally\nconsistent with the risk characteristics used \nfor internal credit risk measurement and      \nmanagement and include key metrics, such as   \nFICO credit scores, delinquency status, loan  \nvintage and macroeconomic indicators. The most\nsignificant inputs to the forecast model for  \nconsumer loans include unemployment rates and \ndelinquency rates. The expected life of       \nrevolving credit card loans is determined by  \nmodeling expected future draws and the timing \nand amount of repayments allocated to the     \nfunded balance. The firm also recognizes an   \nallowance for credit losses on commitments to \nacquire loans. However, no allowance for      \ncredit losses is recognized on credit card    \nlending commitments as they are cancellable by\nthe firm.                                     \n                                       \n  160    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \n  Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP,  \n INC.

The firm\ngenerally calculates\nthe fair value of loans\nand lending commitments\nfor which the fair\nvalue option is elected\nby discounting future\ncash flows at a rate\nwhich incorporates the\ninstrument-specific\ncredit spreads. For\nfloating-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nsubstantially all\nchanges in fair value\nare attributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads, whereas for\nfixed-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nchanges in fair value\nare also attributable\nto changes in interest\nrates.\n                                       \n  168    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nNote 11. Collateralized Agreements and        \nFinancings Collateralized agreements are      \nresale agreements and securities borrowed.    \nCollateralized financings are repurchase      \nagreements, securities loaned and other       \nsecured financings. The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things, \nfacilitate client activities, invest excess   \ncash, acquire securities to cover short       \npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings are  \npresented on a net-by-counterpartybasis when a\nlegal right of setoff exists. Interest on     \ncollateralized agreements, which is included  \nin interest income, and collateralized        \nfinancings, which is included in interest     \nexpense, is recognized over the life of the   \ntransaction. See Note 23 for further          \ninformation about interest income and interest\nexpense. Resale and Repurchase Agreements A   \nresale agreement is a transaction in which the\nfirm purchases financial instruments from a   \nseller, typically in exchange for cash, and   \nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to    \nresell the same or substantially the same     \nfinancial instruments to the seller at a      \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. A repurchase agreement is a transaction \nin which the firm sells financial instruments \nto a buyer, typically in exchange for cash,   \nand simultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same \nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a     \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale       \nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d)involve the legal transfer of       \nownership of financial instruments, they are  \naccounted for as financing arrangements       \nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the  \nmaturity of the agreement. The financial      \ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and   \nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.  \ngovernment and agency, and investment-grade   \nsovereign obligations. The firm receives      \nfinancial instruments purchased under resale  \nagreements and makes delivery of financial    \ninstruments sold under repurchase agreements. \nTo mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these financial           \ninstruments on a daily basis, and delivers or \nobtains additional collateral due to changes  \nin the market value of the financial          \ninstruments, as appropriate. For resale       \nagreements, the firm typically requires       \ncollateral with a fair value approximately    \nequal to the carrying value of the relevant   \nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.    \nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions In\na securities borrowed transaction, the firm   \nborrows securities from a counterparty in     \nexchange for cash or securities. When the firm\nreturns the securities, the counterparty      \nreturns the cash or securities. Interest is   \ngenerally paid periodically over the life of  \nthe transaction. In a securities loaned       \ntransaction, the firm lends securities to a   \ncounterparty in exchange for cash or          \nsecurities. When the counterparty returns the \nsecurities, the firm returns the cash or      \nsecurities posted as collateral. Interest is  \ngenerally paid periodically over the life of  \nthe transaction. The firm receives securities \nborrowed and makes delivery of securities     \nloaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm \nmonitors the market value of these securities \non a daily basis, and delivers or obtains     \nadditional collateral due to changes in the   \nmarket value of the securities, as            \nappropriate. For securities borrowed          \ntransactions, the firm typically requires     \ncollateral with a fair value approximately    \nequal to the carrying value of the securities \nborrowed transaction. Securities borrowed and \nloaned within Fixed Income, Currency and      \nCommodities (FICC) financing are recorded at  \nfair value under the fair value option. See   \nNote 10 for further information about         \nsecurities borrowed and loaned accounted for  \nat fair value. Substantially all of securities\nborrowed and loaned within Equities financing \nare recorded based on the amount of cash      \ncollateral advanced or received plus accrued  \ninterest. The firm also reviews such          \nsecurities borrowed to determine if an        \nallowance for credit losses should be recorded\nby taking into consideration the fair value of\ncollateral received. As these agreements      \ngenerally can be terminated on demand, they   \nexhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes\nin interest rates. Therefore, the carrying    \nvalue of such agreements approximates fair    \nvalue.

If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative assessment.\n\nThe quantitative\ngoodwill test compares\nthe estimated fair\nvalue of each reporting\nunit with its estimated\nnet book value\n(including goodwill and\nidentifiable intangible\nassets). If the\nreporting unit\u2019s\nestimated fair value\nexceeds its estimated\nnet book value,\ngoodwill is not\nimpaired. An impairment\nis recognized if the\nestimated fair value of\na reporting unit is\nless than its estimated\nnet book value.\n\nTo estimate the fair\nvalue of each reporting\nunit, other than\nConsumer banking, a\nrelative value\ntechnique is used\nbecause the firm\nbelieves market\nparticipants would use\nthis technique to value\nthese reporting units.\nThe relative value\ntechnique applies\nobservable price-to-\nearnings multiples or\nprice-to-book multiples\nof comparable\ncompetitors to\nreporting units\u2019 net\nearnings or net book\nvalue. To estimate the\nfair value of Consumer\nbanking, a discounted\ncash flow valuation\napproach is used\nbecause the firm\nbelieves market\nparticipants would use\nthis technique to value\nthat reporting unit\ngiven its early stage\nof development. The\nestimated net carrying\nvalue of each reporting\nunit reflects an\nallocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nand represents the\nestimated amount of\ntotal shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    173  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nIn the fourth quarter\nof 2021, the firm\nperformed its annual\nassessment of goodwill\nfor impairment, for\neach of its reporting\nunits, by performing a\nqualitative\nassessment. Multiple\nfactors were assessed\nwith respect to each\nof the firm\u2019s\nreporting units to\ndetermine whether it\nwas more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of any of\nthose reporting units\nwas less than its\nestimated carrying\nvalue. The qualitative\nassessment also\nconsidered changes\nsince a quantitative\ntest was last\nperformed in 2019.\n\nThe firm considered\nthe following factors\nin the qualitative\nannual assessment when\nevaluating whether it\nwas more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit was\nless than its\nestimated carrying\nvalue:\n                                              \n       Performance Indicators.During 2021,    \n       the firm\u2019s net revenues, diluted       \n       earnings per common share (EPS),       \n       return on average common               \n       shareholders\u2019 equity and book value    \n       per common share all increased from    \n       2020 and from when a quantitative      \n       test was last performed in 2019. The   \n  \u2022    firm\u2019s operating expenses increased,   \n       primarily reflecting significantly     \n       higher compensation and benefits       \n       expenses (reflecting strong financial  \n       performance). Despite the increase in  \n       expenses, both the efficiency ratio    \n       (total operating expenses divided by   \n       total net revenues) andpre-taxmargin   \n       improved compared with 2020.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Macroeconomic Indicators.The global    \n       economy continued to recover during    \n       2021 from the impact of                \n       theCOVID-19pandemic, as the lifting    \n       of health and safety restrictions      \n       amid vaccine distribution facilitated  \n  \u2022    an increase in global economic         \n       recovery, and monetary and fiscal      \n       policy from central banks and          \n       governments remained accommodative.    \n       However, there remains uncertainty     \n       related to the impact and the          \n       duration of theCOVID-19pandemic.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Firm and Industry Events.There were    \n       no events, entity-specific or          \n  \u2022    otherwise, that would have had a       \n       significant negative impact on the     \n       valuation of the firm\u2019s reporting      \n       units.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Fair Value Indicators.Since the 2020   \n       qualitative goodwill test, fair value  \n       indicators in the market generally     \n       improved, as global equity prices      \n       were higher, credit spreads were       \n       tighter, and the firm and its peers\u2019   \n       stock prices                           \n  \u2022    andprice-to-bookmultiples were         \n       higher. Despite increased inflation    \n       concerns, supply chain challenges and  \n       the rise in COVID-19 cases in the      \n       fourth quarter of 2021, the firm\u2019s     \n       stock price andprice-to-bookmultiple   \n       ended the year higher compared with    \n       the end of 2020.                       \n                                              \nAs a result of the\nqualitative assessment,\nthe firm determined\nthat it was more likely\nthan not that the\nestimated fair value of\neach reporting unit\nexceeded its respective\nestimated carrying\nvalue. Therefore, the\nfirm determined that\ngoodwill for each\nreporting unit was not\nimpaired and that a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest was not required.\nIdentifiable Intangible                       \nAssets                                        \nThe table below\npresents identifiable\nintangible assets by\nreporting unit and\ntype.\n                                              \n                    As of                     \n                 December                     \n  $ in\u00a0              2021            2020     \n  millions                                    \n  By                                          \n  Reporting                                   \n  Unit                                        \n  Global                                      \n  Markets:                                    \n  FICC                 $1               $     \n                                        2     \n  Equities             43              45     \n  Asset               122             274     \n  Manageme\u2026                                   \n  Consumer\u00a0                                   \n  & Wealth                                    \n  Manageme\u2026                                   \n  Consumer              \u2013               6     \n  banking                                     \n  Wealth              252             303     \n  manageme\u2026                                   \n  Total                 $        $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0630     \n                      418                     \n  By Type                                     \n  Customer                                    \n  lists                                       \n  Gross                 $                     \n  carrying          1,460         $\u00a01,478     \n  value                                       \n  Accumula\u2026        (1,130  )       (1,089  )  \n  amortiza\u2026                                   \n  Net                                         \n  carrying            330             389     \n  value                                       \n  Acquired                                    \n  leases                                      \n  and other                                   \n  Gross                                       \n  carrying            500             710     \n  value                                       \n  Accumula\u2026          (412  )         (469  )  \n  amortiza\u2026                                   \n  Net                                         \n  carrying             88             241     \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  gross             1,960           2,188     \n  carrying                                    \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  accumula\u2026        (1,542  )       (1,558  )  \n  amortiza\u2026                                   \n  Total net             $                     \n  carrying            418        $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0630     \n  value                                       \n                                              \nDuring 2021, the amount\nof intangible assets\nacquired by the firm\nwas no t material.

To the\nextent the carrying\nvalue of an asset or\nasset group exceeds\nthe projected\nundiscounted cash\nflows expected to\nresult from the use\nand eventual disposal\nof the asset or asset\ngroup, the firm\ndetermines the asset\nor asset group is\nimpaired and records\nan impairment equal to\nthe difference between\nthe estimated fair\nvalue and the carrying\nvalue of the asset or\nasset group. In\naddition, the firm\nwill recognize an\nimpairment prior to\nthe sale of an asset\nor asset group if the\ncarrying value of the\nasset or asset group\nexceeds its estimated\nfair value. There were\nno material\nimpairments during\n2021,\u00a02020 or 2019.\nOperating Lease Right-                        \nof-UseAssets                                  \nThe firm enters into\noperating leases for\nreal estate, office\nequipment and other\nassets, substantially\nall of which are used\nin connection with its\noperations. For leases\nlonger than one year,\nthe firm recognizes a\nright-of-use asset\nrepresenting the right\nto use the underlying\nasset for the lease\nterm, and a lease\nliability representing\nthe liability to make\npayments. The lease\nterm is generally\ndetermined based on the\ncontractual maturity of\nthe lease. For leases\nwhere the firm has the\noption to terminate or\nextend the lease, an\nassessment of the\nlikelihood of\nexercising the option\nis incorporated into\nthe determination of\nthe lease term. Such\nassessment is initially\nperformed at the\ninception of the lease\nand is updated if\nevents occur that\nimpact the original\nassessment.\n\nAn operating lease\nright-of-use asset is\ninitially determined\nbased on the operating\nlease liability,\nadjusted for initial\ndirect costs, lease\nincentives and amounts\npaid at or prior to\nlease commencement.\nThis amount is then\namortized over the\nlease term.

The firm        \nreassesses its determination of whether it is \nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and              \ncircumstances. VIE Activities The firm is     \nprincipally involved with VIEs through the    \nfollowing business activities: Mortgage-Backed\nVIEs. The firm sells residential and          \ncommercial mortgage loans and securities to   \nmortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial\ninterests in the assets sold to these VIEs.   \nThe firm purchases and sells beneficial       \ninterests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in   \nconnection with market-making activities. In  \naddition, the firm may enter into derivatives \nwith certain of these VIEs, primarily interest\nrate swaps, which are typically not variable  \ninterests. The firm generally enters into     \nderivatives with other counterparties to      \nmitigate its risk. Real Estate, Credit- and   \nPower-Related and Other Investing VIEs. The   \nfirm purchases equity and debt securities     \nissued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold   \nreal estate, performing and nonperforming     \ndebt, distressed loans, power-related assets  \nand equity securities. The firm generally does\nnot sell assets to, or enter into derivatives \nwith, these VIEs. Corporate Debt and Other    \nAsset-Backed VIEs. The firm structures VIEs   \nthat issue notes to clients, purchases and    \nsells beneficial interests issued by corporate\ndebt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection\nwith market-making activities, and makes loans\nto VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain\nof these VIEs synthetically create the        \nexposure for the beneficial interests they    \nissue by entering into credit derivatives with\nthe firm, rather than purchasing the          \nunderlying assets. In addition, the firm may  \nenter into derivatives, such as total return  \nswaps, with certain corporate debt and other  \nasset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays  \nthe VIE a return due to the beneficial        \ninterest holders and receives the return on   \nthe collateral owned by the VIE. The          \ncollateral owned by these VIEs is primarily   \nother asset-backed loans and securities. The  \nfirm may be removed as the total return swap  \ncounterparty and may enter into derivatives   \nwith other counterparties to mitigate its risk\nrelated to these swaps. The firm may sell     \nassets to the corporate debt and other asset- \nbacked VIEs it structures.                    \n                                       \n  182    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm also extends \nlending commitments in connection with other  \ntypes of corporate lending, as well as        \ncommercial real estate financing. See Note 9  \nfor further information about funded loans. To\nmitigate the credit risk associated with the  \nfirm\u2019s commercial lending activities, the firm\nobtains credit protection on certain loans and\nlending commitments through credit default    \nswaps, both single-name and index-based       \ncontracts, and through the issuance of credit-\nlinked notes. Warehouse Financing. The firm   \nprovides financing to clients who warehouse   \nfinancial assets. These arrangements are      \nsecured by the warehoused assets, primarily   \nconsisting of residential real estate,        \nconsumer and corporate loans. Credit Cards.   \nThe firm\u2019s credit card lending commitments    \nincluded $ 33.97billion as of December 2021   \nand $ 21.64billion as of December 2020 related\nto credit card lines issued by the firm to    \nconsumers.

This        \nacquisition was completed in February 2022.   \nRisk Participations The firm also risk        \nparticipates certain of its commercial lending\ncommitments to other financial institutions.  \nIn the event of a risk participant\u2019s default, \nthe firm will be responsible to fund the      \nborrower.

The firm\u2019s funding \nof these commitments depends on the           \nsatisfaction of all contractual conditions to \nthe resale agreement and these commitments can\nexpire unused. Investment Commitments         \nInvestment commitments includes commitments to\ninvest in private equity, real estate and     \nother assets directly and through funds that  \nthe firm raises and manages. Investment       \ncommitments included $ 1.60billion as of      \nDecember 2021 and $ 1.69billion as of December\n2020, related to commitments to invest in     \nfunds managed by the firm.

The firm enters into   \nvarious derivatives that meet the definition  \nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including     \nwritten equity and commodity put options,     \nwritten currency contracts and interest rate  \ncaps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives \nare risk managed together with derivatives    \nthat do not meet the definition of a          \nguarantee, and therefore the amounts in the   \ntable above do not reflect the firm\u2019s overall \nrisk related to derivative activities.        \nDisclosures about derivatives are not required\nif they may be cash settled and the firm has  \nno basis to conclude it is probable that the  \ncounterparties held the underlying instruments\nat inception of the contract. The firm has    \nconcluded that these conditions have been met \nfor certain large, internationally active     \ncommercial and investment bank counterparties,\ncentral clearing counterparties, hedge funds  \nand certain other counterparties. Accordingly,\nthe firm has not included such contracts in   \nthe table above. See Note 7 for information   \nabout credit derivatives that meet the        \ndefinition of a guarantee, which are not      \nincluded in the table above. Derivatives are  \naccounted for at fair value and therefore the \ncarrying value is considered the best         \nindication of payment/performance risk for    \nindividual contracts. However, the carrying   \nvalues in the table above exclude the effect  \nof counterparty and cash collateral netting.  \nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees.   \nSecurities lending and clearing guarantees    \ninclude the indemnifications and guarantees   \nthat the firm provides in its capacity as an  \nagency lender and in its capacity as a        \nsponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. As an agency lender, the firm    \nindemnifies most of its securities lending    \ncustomers against losses incurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not return securities and   \nthe collateral held is insufficient to cover  \nthe market value of the securities borrowed.  \nThe maximum payout of such indemnifications   \nwas $ 11.05billion as of December 2021 and $  \n19.86billion as of December 2020. Collateral  \nheld by the lenders in connection with        \nsecurities lending indemnifications was $     \n11.36billion as of December 2021 and $        \n20.39billion as of December 2020. Because the \ncontractual nature of these arrangements      \nrequires the firm to obtain collateral with a \nmarket value that exceeds the value of the    \nsecurities lent to the borrower, there is     \nminimal performance risk associated with these\nindemnifications.                             \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    187  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements As \na sponsoring member of the Government         \nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income       \nClearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the \nperformance of its sponsored member clients to\nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in      \nconnection with certain resale and repurchase \nagreements. To minimize potential losses on   \nsuch guarantees, the firm obtains a security  \ninterest in the collateral that the sponsored \nclient placed with the Fixed Income Clearing  \nCorporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on   \nsuch guarantees is minimal. There were no     \namounts outstanding under the guarantee as of \nDecember 2021. As of December 2020, the       \nmaximum payout on this guarantee was $        \n1.49billion and the related collateral held   \nwas $ 1.50billion. Other Financial Guarantees.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the firm  \nprovides other financial guarantees of the    \nobligations of third parties (e.g., standby   \nletters of credit and other guarantees to     \nenable clients to complete transactions and   \nfund-related guarantees). These guarantees    \nrepresent obligations to make payments to     \nbeneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to\nfulfill its obligation under a contractual    \narrangement with that beneficiary. Other      \nfinancial guarantees also include a guarantee \nthat the firm has provided to the Government  \nof Malaysia that it will receive at least $   \n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets \nseized by governmental authorities around the \nworld related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad,\na sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB).   \nThe firm evaluates progress toward satisfying \nthis obligation based on the report that it   \nreceives on a semi-annual basis, expected in  \nFebruary and August. Based on the latest      \nreport as of August 2021, approximately $     \n450million in assets or proceeds from assets  \nhas been returned to the Government of        \nMalaysia in connection with this guarantee,   \nwhich must be satisfied by August 18, 2025.   \nAny amounts paid by the firm under this       \nguarantee would be subject to reimbursement in\nthe event the assets or proceeds received by  \nthe Government of Malaysia through August 18, \n2028 exceeds $ 1.4billion. See Note 27 for    \nfurther information about matters related to  \n1MDB. Guarantees of Securities Issued by      \nTrusts. The firm has established trusts,      \nincluding Goldman Sachs Capital I, the APEX   \nTrusts and other entities, for the limited    \npurpose of issuing securities to third        \nparties, lending the proceeds to the firm and \nentering into contractual arrangements with   \nthe firm and third parties related to this    \npurpose. The firm does not consolidate these  \nentities. See Note 14 for further information \nabout the transactions involving Goldman Sachs\nCapital I and the APEX Trusts. The firm       \neffectively provides for the full and         \nunconditional guarantee of the securities     \nissued by these entities. Timely payment by   \nthe firm of amounts due to these entities     \nunder the guarantee, borrowing, preferred     \nstock and related contractual arrangements    \nwill be sufficient to cover payments due on   \nthe securities issued by these entities. No   \nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the       \nsecurities of Goldman Sachs Capital I or the  \nAPEX Trusts. Management believes that it is   \nunlikely that any circumstances will occur,   \nsuch as nonperformance on the part of paying  \nagents or other service providers, that would \nmake it necessary for the firm to make        \npayments related to these entities other than \nthose required under the terms of the         \nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and     \nrelated contractual arrangements and in       \nconnection with certain expenses incurred by  \nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of \nService Providers. In the ordinary course of  \nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees \ncertain service providers, such as clearing   \nand custody agents, trustees and              \nadministrators, against specified potential   \nlosses in connection with their acting as an  \nagent of, or providing services to, the firm  \nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses   \narising from its custodial role or caused by  \nacts or omissions of third-party service      \nproviders, including sub-custodiansand third- \nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has \nthe right to seek indemnification from these  \nthird-party service providers for certain     \nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In      \naddition, the firm is a member of payment,    \nclearing and settlement networks, as well as  \nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of   \nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of   \nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In  \nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear \nand settle on behalf of its clients the       \ntransactions entered into by them with other  \nbrokerage firms. The firm\u2019s obligations in    \nrespect of such transactions are secured by   \nthe assets in the client\u2019s account, as well as\nany proceeds received from the transactions   \ncleared and settled by the firm on behalf of  \nthe client. In connection with joint venture  \ninvestments, the firm may issue loan          \nguarantees under which it may be liable in the\nevent of fraud, misappropriation,             \nenvironmental liabilities and certain other   \nmatters involving the borrower.               \n                                       \n  188    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

This increase was partially offset \nby a decrease in equity investments           \n(principally due to the sale of equity        \npositions). Advanced Market RWAs as of        \nDecember 2021 increased by $ 7.79billion      \ncompared with December 2020, primarily        \nreflecting an increase in stressed VaR        \n(principally due to increased exposures to    \ninterest rates).

These decreases were   \npartially offset by an increase in securities \nfinancing transactions (principally due to    \nincreased funding exposures). Standardized    \nMarket RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $\n4.14billion compared with December 2019,      \nprimarily reflecting an increase in regulatory\nVaR (principally due to increased market      \nvolatility) and an increase in incremental    \nrisk (principally due to increased exposures  \nin equities held for market-making purposes). \nThese increases were partially offset by a    \ndecrease in specific risk (principally due to \nchanges in risk measurements on certain       \nexposures). Advanced Credit RWAs as of        \nDecember 2020 increased by $ 51.63billion     \ncompared with December 2019, primarily        \nreflecting an increase in derivatives         \n(principally due to the impact of higher      \nlevels of volatility and counterparty credit  \nrisk) and an increase in commitments,         \nguarantees and loans (principally due to      \nincreased lending activity). These increases  \nwere partially offset by a decrease in equity \ninvestments (principally due to the sale of   \ncertain equity positions).

These\nprofits contributed\napproximately 58 basis\npoints to the leverage\nratio.\n\nThe deposits of GSBE\nare covered by the\nGerman statutory\ndeposit protection\nprogram to the extent\nprovided by law. In\naddition, GSBE has\nelected to participate\nin the German\nvoluntary deposit\nprotection program\nwhich provides\ninsurance for certain\neligible deposits not\ncovered by the German\nstatutory deposit\nprogram. GSBE is\nsubject to minimum\nreserve requirements\nat central banks in\ncertain of the\njurisdictions in which\nit operates. The\nminimum reserve\nrequirement was $ 189\nmillion as of\nDecember\u00a02021 and $ 25\nmillion as of\nDecember\u00a02020. The\namount deposited by\nGSBE at central banks\nwas $ 20.36 billion as\nof December\u00a02021 and $\n3.17 billion as of\nDecember\u00a02020,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich was deposited\nwith Deutsche\nBundesbank.\n\nGSBE is a registered\nswap dealer with the\nCFTC and, beginning in\nthe fourth quarter of\n2021, also became a\nregistered security-\nbased swap dealer with\nthe SEC. As of\nDecember 2021, GSBE\nwas subject to and in\ncompliance with\napplicable capital\nrequirements for swap\ndealers and security-\nbased swap dealers.\nRestrictions on Payments Group Inc. may be    \nlimited in its ability to access capital held \nat certain subsidiaries as a result of        \nregulatory, tax or other constraints. These   \nlimitations include provisions of applicable  \nlaw and regulations and other regulatory      \nrestrictions that limit the ability of those  \nsubsidiaries to declare and pay dividends     \nwithout prior regulatory approval. For        \nexample, the amount of dividends that may be  \npaid by GS Bank USA are limited to the lesser \nof the amounts calculated under a recent      \nearnings test and an undivided profits test.  \nAs a result of dividends paid in connection   \nwith the acquisition of GSBE in July 2021, GS \nBank USA cannot currently declare any         \nadditional dividends without prior regulatory \napproval. In addition, subsidiaries not       \nsubject to separate regulatory capital        \nrequirements may hold capital to satisfy local\ntax and legal guidelines, rating agency       \nrequirements (for entities with assigned      \ncredit ratings) or internal policies,         \nincluding policies concerning the minimum     \namount of capital a subsidiary should hold    \nbased on its underlying level of risk. Group  \nInc.\u2019s equity investment in subsidiaries was $\n118.90billion as of December 2021 and $       \n103.80billion as of December 2020, of which   \nGroup Inc. was required to maintain $         \n77.22billion as of December 2021 and $        \n63.68billion as of December 2020, of minimum  \nequity capital in its regulated subsidiaries  \nin order to satisfy the regulatory            \nrequirements of such subsidiaries.

As of December  \n2021, the U.S. federal net operating loss     \ncarryforward was $ 1.16billion, the state and \nlocal net operating loss carryforward was $   \n1.80billion, and the foreign net operating    \nloss carryforward was $ 1.31billion. If not   \nutilized, the U.S. federal, the state and     \nlocal, and foreign net operating loss         \ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2022. If\nthese carryforwards expire, they will not have\na material impact on the firm\u2019s results of    \noperations. As of December 2021, the firm has \nrecorded deferred tax assets of $ 32million in\nconnection with general business credit       \ncarryforwards and $ 11million in connection   \nwith state and local tax credit carryforwards.\nIf not utilized, the general business credit  \ncarryforward will begin to expire in 2022and  \nthe state and local tax credit carryforward   \nwill begin to expire in 2023. As of December  \n2021, the firm did not have any foreign tax   \ncredit carryforwards. As of both December 2021\nand December 2020, the firm had no U.S.       \ncapital loss carryforwards and norelated net  \ndeferred income tax assets. As of December    \n2021, the firm had deferred tax assets of $   \n270million in connection with foreign capital \nloss carryforwards and a valuation allowance  \nof $ 270million related to these capital loss \ncarryforwards. The valuation allowance        \nincreased by $ 344million during 2021 and     \nincreased by $ 84million during 2020. The     \nincreases in both 2021 and 2020 were primarily\ndue to an increase in deferred tax assets from\nwhich the firm does not expect to realize any \nbenefit. The firm permanently reinvested      \neligible earnings of certain foreign          \nsubsidiaries.

These\nactivities expose the\nfirm to many different\nindustries and\ncounterparties, and may\nalso subject the firm\nto a concentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular central\nbank, counterparty,\nborrower or issuer,\nincluding sovereign\nissuers, or to a\nparticular clearing\nhouse or exchange. The\nfirm seeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by actively\nmonitoring exposures\nand obtaining\ncollateral from\ncounterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm considers\nwhen determining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts. Netting and\ncollateral agreements\npermit the firm to\noffset receivables and\npayables with such\ncounterparties and/or\nenable the firm to\nobtain collateral on an\nupfront or contingent\nbasis.\nThe table below\npresents the credit\nconcentrations included\nin trading cash\ninstruments and\ninvestments.\n                                              \n                          As of               \n                       December               \n  $ in\u00a0                    2021         2020  \n  millions                                    \n  U.S.                                        \n  government           $141,191     $187,009  \n  and agency                                  \n  obligations                                 \n  Percentage                                  \n  of total                 9.6%        16.1%  \n  assets                                      \n  Non-U.S.gov\u2026                                \n  and agency            $51,426    $\u00a0\u00a059,580  \n  obligations                                 \n  Percentage                                  \n  of total                 3.5%         5.1%  \n  assets                                      \n                                              \nIn addition, the firm\nhad $ 222.20 billion as\nof December\u00a02021 and $\n116.63 billion as of\nDecember\u00a02020 of cash\ndeposits held at\ncentral banks (included\nin cash and cash\nequivalents), of which\n$ 122.01 billion as of\nDecember\u00a02021 and $\n52.71 billion as of\nDecember\u00a02020 was held\nat the Fed e ral\nReserve.\nAs of both\nDecember\u00a02021 and\nDecember\u00a02020, the firm\ndid not have credit\nexposure to any other\ncounterparty that\nexceeded 2 % of total\nassets.\n                                       \n  208    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In addition, GS   \nMalaysia pleaded guilty to one count of       \nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was       \nsentenced on June 9, 2021.

The same   \nGoldman Sachs entities arealso among the      \ndefendants named in two antitrust actions     \nrelating to the trading of interest rate      \nswaps, commenced in April 2016 and June 2018, \nrespectively, in the U.S. District Court for  \nthe Southern District of New York by three    \noperators of swap execution facilities and    \ncertain of their affiliates. These actions    \nhave been consolidated for pretrial           \nproceedings. The complaints generally assert  \nclaims under federal antitrust law and state  \ncommon law in connection with an alleged      \nconspiracy among the defendants to preclude   \nexchange trading of interest rate swaps. The  \ncomplaints in the individual actions also     \nassert claims under state antitrust law. The  \ncomplaints seek declaratory and injunctive    \nrelief, as well as treble damages in an       \nunspecified amount. Defendants moved to       \ndismiss the class and the first individual    \naction and the district court dismissed the   \nstate common law claims asserted by the       \nplaintiffs in the first individual action and \notherwise limited the state common law claim  \nin the putative class action and the antitrust\nclaims in both actions to the period from 2013\nto 2016.

On March 29, 2020, the    \ncourt granted the defendants\u2019 motions to      \ndismiss and for reconsideration, resulting in \nthe dismissal of all claims. On April 27,     \n2020, plaintiffs appealed to the Second       \nCircuit Court of Appeals. GS&Co., GSI, J.

These plans    \ngenerally provide benefits based on years of  \ncredited service and a percentage of eligible \ncompensation. The firm maintains a defined    \nbenefit pension plan for certain U.K.         \nemployees. As of April 2008, the U.K. defined \nbenefit plan was closed to new participants   \nand frozen for existing participants as of    \nMarch 31, 2016. The non-U.S.plans do not have \na material impact on the firm\u2019s consolidated  \nresults of operations. The firm also maintains\na defined benefit pension plan for            \nsubstantially all U.S. employees hired prior  \nto November 1, 2003. As of November 2004, this\nplan was closed to new participants and frozen\nfor existing participants. In addition, the   \nfirm maintains unfunded postretirement benefit\nplans that provide medical and life insurance \nfor eligible retirees and their dependents    \ncovered under these programs. These plans do  \nnot have a material impact on the firm\u2019s      \nconsolidated results of operations. The firm  \nrecognizes the funded status of its defined   \nbenefit pension and postretirement plans,     \nmeasured as the difference between the fair   \nvalue of the plan assets and the benefit      \nobligation, in the consolidated balance       \nsheets. As of December 2021, other assets     \nincluded $ 411million (related to overfunded  \npension plans) and other liabilities included \n$ 426million related to these plans. As of    \nDecember 2020, other assets included $        \n343million (related to overfunded pension     \nplans) and other liabilities included $       \n478million related to these plans.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nNote 29. Employee Incentive Plans The cost of \nemployee services received in exchange for a  \nshare-based award is generally measured based \non the grant-date fair value of the award.    \nShare-based awards that do not require future \nservice (i.e., vested awards, including awards\ngranted to retirement-eligible employees) are \nexpensed immediately. Share-based awards that \nrequire future service are amortized over the \nrelevant service period. Forfeitures are      \nrecorded when they occur. Cash dividend       \nequivalents paid on RSUs are generally charged\nto retained earnings. If RSUs that require    \nfuture service are forfeited, the related     \ndividend equivalents originally charged to    \nretained earnings are reclassified to         \ncompensation expense in the period in which   \nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues  \nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of   \nshare-based awards. In certain cases,         \nprimarily related to conflicted employment (as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements), \nthe firm may cash settle share-based          \ncompensation awards accounted for as equity   \ninstruments. For these awards, whose terms    \nallow for cash settlement, additional paid-   \nincapital is adjusted to the extent of the    \ndifference between the value of the award at  \nthe time of cash settlement and the grant-date\nvalue of the award. Stock Incentive Plan The  \nfirm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The     \nGoldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock      \nIncentive Plan (2021) (2021 SIP), which       \nprovides for grants of RSUs, restricted stock,\ndividend equivalent rights, incentive stock   \noptions, nonqualified stock options, stock    \nappreciation rights, and other share-based    \nawards, each of which may be subject to terms \nand conditions, including performance or      \nmarket conditions. On April 29, 2021,         \nshareholders approved the 2021 SIP. The 2021  \nSIP is a successor to several predecessor     \nstock incentive plans, the first of which was \nadopted on April 30, 1999, and each of which  \nwas approved by the firm\u2019s shareholders. As of\nDecember 2021, 69.8million shares were        \navailable to be delivered pursuant to awards  \ngranted under the 2021 SIP. If any shares of  \ncommon stock underlying awards granted under  \nthe 2021 SIP or awards granted under the 2018,\n2015 or 2013 predecessor stock incentive plans\nare not delivered because such awards are     \nforfeited, terminated or canceled, or if      \nshares of common stock underlying such awards \nare surrendered or withheld to satisfy any    \nobligation of the grantee (including taxes),  \nthose shares will become available to be      \ndelivered pursuant to awards granted under the\n2021 SIP. Shares available to be delivered    \nunder the 2021 SIP also are subject to        \nadjustment for certain events or changes in   \ncorporate structure as provided under the 2021\nSIP. The 2021 SIP is scheduled to terminate on\nthe date of the annual meeting of shareholders\nthat occurs in 2025. Restricted Stock Units   \nThe firm grants RSUs (including RSUs subject  \nto performance or market conditions) to       \nemployees, which are generally valued based on\nthe closing price of the underlying shares on \nthe date of grant after taking into account a \nliquidity discount for any applicable post-   \nvesting and delivery transfer restrictions.   \nThe value of equity awards also considers the \nimpact of material non-public information, if \nany, that the firm expects to make available  \nshortly following grant. RSUs generally vest  \nand underlying shares of common stock deliver \n(net of required withholding tax) as outlined \nin the applicable award agreements.Award      \nagreements generally provide that vesting is  \naccelerated in certain circumstances, such as \non retirement, death, disability and, in      \ncertain cases, conflicted employment. Delivery\nof the underlying shares of common stock is   \nconditioned on the grantees satisfying certain\nvesting and other requirements outlined in the\naward agreements. RSUs not subject to         \nperformance conditions generally vest         \nanddeliver over a three-year period. RSUs that\nare subject to performance or market          \nconditions generally deliver after the end of \na three to five year period. For awards that  \nare subject to performance or market          \nconditions, generally the final award is      \nadjusted from zeroup to 150% of the original  \ngrant based on satisfaction of those          \nconditions. Dividend equivalents that accrue  \non these awards are paid when the awards      \nsettle.                                       \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K    219  \n                                       \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.
