We have also\nimplemented the\nEnvironmental & Social\nDue Diligence\nGuidelines to guide\nour overall risk-based\ndue diligence approach\nwhen evaluating\nrelevant transactions\nfor environmental and\nsocial risks and\nimpacts.\n\nRelevant employees\nalso receive training\nwith respect to\nenvironmental and\nsocial risks,\nincluding for sectors\nand industries that we\nbelieve have higher\npotential for these\nrisks.

We have\ncompleted\nsustainability debt\nissuances, which align\nwith our sustainable\nfinance framework and\nfund a range of on-\nbalance sheet\nsustainable finance\nactivity. We believe\nwe can advance\nsustainability by\npartnering with our\nclients across our\nbusinesses, including\nby developing new\nsustainability-linked\nfinancing solutions,\noffering strategic\nadvice, or co-\ninvesting alongside\nour clients in energy\ncompanies. We have\nannounced a target to\ndeploy $750 billion in\nsustainable financing,\ninvesting and advisory\nactivity by the\nbeginning of 2030. As\nof December 2024, we\nachieved over 80% of\nthat goal, with the\nmajority dedicated to\nClimate Transition.\n\nWith respect to\nClimate Transition, we\nhave announced our\ngoal to align our\nfinancing activities\nwith a net-zero-\nby-2050 pathway. We\nhave an initial set of\n2030 targets for our\nenergy, power and auto\nmanufacturing\nportfolios, three\nsectors where we see\nan opportunity to\nproactively engage our\nclients and investors,\ndeploy capital\nrequired for\ntransition, and invest\nin new commercial\nsolutions to\nfacilitate\ndecarbonization in the\nreal economy. Carbon\nneutrality is also a\npriority for the\noperation of our firm.\nWe have been carbon\nneutral in our\noperations and\nbusiness travel since\n2015 through a\ncombination of\nemissions reduction\nefforts and the\nprocurement of Energy\nAttribute Certificates\nand third-party-\nverified carbon\noffsets. We have since\nexpanded our\noperational carbon\ncommitment to include\nour supply chain,\nprioritizing emissions\nreductions.\n                                     \n  8    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                     \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition to Climate\nTransition, our\napproach to\nsustainability also\ncenters on Inclusive\nGrowth where we seek\nto help drive\nsolutions that expand\naccess, increase\naffordability, and\nsupport outcomes to\nadvance sustainable\neconomic growth.\nCommercial solutions\nthat seek to support\nInclusive Growth\ninclude, among others,\nthose of our Urban\nInvestment Group and\nour Sustainable\nInvesting Group. We\nalso seek to support\nInclusive Growth\nthrough our corporate\nengagement programs,\nsuch as 10,000 Small\nBusinesses, 10,000\nWomen and One Million\nBlack Women . These\nefforts are further\nstrengthened by\nstrategic partnerships\nthat we have\nestablished in areas\nwhere we have\nidentified gaps or\nbelieve we are able to\ndrive even greater\nimpact through\ncollaboration. We\nbelieve our ability to\nachieve our\nsustainability\nobjectives is\ncritically dependent\non the strengths and\ntalents of our people.\nSee \u201cBusiness \u2014 Human\nCapital Management\u201d\nfor information about\nour human capital\nmanagement programs\nand policies.\nCompetition\nThe financial services\nindustry and all of\nour businesses are\nintensely competitive,\nand we expect them to\nremain so. Our\ncompetitors provide\ninvestment banking,\nmarket-making and\nasset management\nservices, private\nbanking and lending,\ncommercial lending,\ncredit cards,\ntransaction banking,\ndeposit-taking and\nother banking products\nand services, and make\ninvestments in\nsecurities,\ncommodities,\nderivatives, real\nestate, loans and\nother financial\nassets. Our\ncompetitors include\nbrokers and dealers,\ninvestment banking\nfirms, commercial\nbanks, credit card\nissuers, insurance\ncompanies, investment\nadvisers, mutual\nfunds, hedge funds,\nprivate equity funds,\nprivate credit funds,\nmerchant banks and\nfinancial technology\nand other internet-\nbased companies. Some\nof our competitors\noperate globally and\nothers regionally, and\nwe compete based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding transaction\nexecution, client\nexperience, products\nand services,\ninnovation, reputation\nand price.\n\nWe have faced, and\nexpect to continue to\nface, pressure to\nretain market share by\ncommitting capital to\nbusinesses or\ntransactions on terms\nthat offer returns\nthat may not be\ncommensurate with\ntheir risks. In\nparticular, corporate\nclients seek such\ncommitments (such as\nagreements to\nparticipate in their\nloan facilities) from\nfinancial services\nfirms in connection\nwith investment\nbanking and other\nassignments.\n\nConsolidation and\nconvergence have\nsignificantly\nincreased the capital\nbase and geographic\nreach of some of our\ncompetitors and have\nalso hastened the\nglobalization of the\nsecurities and other\nfinancial services\nmarkets. As a result,\nwe have had to commit\ncapital to support our\ninternational\noperations and to\nexecute large global\ntransactions. To\ncapitalize on some of\nour most significant\nopportunities, we will\nhave to compete\nsuccessfully with\nfinancial institutions\nthat are larger and\nhave more capital and\nthat may have a\nstronger local\npresence and longer\noperating history\noutside the U.S.\n\nWe also compete with\nsmaller institutions\nthat offer more\ntargeted services,\nsuch as independent\nadvisory firms. Some\nclients may perceive\nthese firms to be less\nsusceptible to\npotential conflicts of\ninterest than we are,\nand, as described\nbelow, our ability to\neffectively compete\nwith them could be\naffected by\nregulations and\nlimitations on\nactivities that apply\nto us but may not\napply to them.\n\nA number of our\nbusinesses are subject\nto intense price\ncompetition. Efforts\nby our competitors to\ngain market share have\nresulted in pricing\npressure in our\ninvestment banking,\nmarket-making,\nconsumer, wealth\nmanagement and asset\nmanagement businesses.\nFor example, the\nincreasing volume of\ntrades executed\nelectronically,\nthrough the internet\nand through\nalternative trading\nsystems, has increased\nthe pressure on\ntrading commissions,\nin that commissions\nfor electronic trading\nare generally lower\nthan those for non-\nelectronic trading. It\nappears that this\ntrend toward low-\ncommission trading\nwill continue. Price\ncompetition has also\nled to compression in\nthe difference between\nthe price at which a\nmarket participant is\nwilling to sell an\ninstrument and the\nprice at which another\nmarket participant is\nwilling to buy it\n(i.e., bid/offer\nspread), which has\naffected our market-\nmaking businesses. The\nincreasing prevalence\nof passive investment\nstrategies that\ntypically have lower\nfees than other\nstrategies we offer\nhas affected the\ncompetitive and\npricing dynamics for\nour asset management\nproducts and services.\nIn addition, we\nbelieve that we will\ncontinue to experience\ncompetitive pressures\nin these and other\nareas in the future as\nsome of our\ncompetitors seek to\nobtain market share by\nfurther reducing\nprices, and as we\nenter into or expand\nour presence in\nmarkets that rely more\nheavily on electronic\ntrading and execution.\nWe and other banks\nalso compete for\ndeposits on the basis\nof the rates we offer.\nHigher short-term\ninterest rates in\nrecent years have\nresulted in and may\ncontinue to result in\nmore intense\ncompetition in deposit\npricing, as well as\ncompetition from non-\ndeposit financial\nproducts.\n                                     \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    9  \n                                     \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe also compete on the\nbasis of the types of\nfinancial products and\nclient experiences\nthat we and our\ncompetitors offer. In\nsome circumstances,\nour competitors may\noffer financial\nproducts that we do\nnot offer and that our\nclients may prefer,\nincluding\ncryptocurrencies and\nother digital assets\nthat we cannot or may\nchoose not to provide.\nOur competitors may\nalso develop\ntechnology platforms\nthat provide a better\nclient experience.\n\nThe provisions of the\nU.S. Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and\nConsumer Protection\nAct (Dodd-Frank Act),\nthe requirements\npromulgated by the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\n(Basel Committee) and\nother financial\nregulations could\naffect our competitive\nposition to the extent\nthat limitations on\nactivities, increased\nfees and compliance\ncosts or other\nregulatory\nrequirements do not\napply, or do not apply\nequally, to all of our\ncompetitors or are not\nimplemented uniformly\nacross different\njurisdictions. For\nexample, the\nprovisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act that\nprohibit proprietary\ntrading and restrict\ninvestments in certain\nhedge and private\nequity funds\ndifferentiate between\nU.S.-based and\nnon-U.S.-based banking\norganizations and give\nnon-U.S.-based banking\norganizations greater\nflexibility to trade\noutside of the U.S.\nand to form and invest\nin funds outside the\nU.S.\n\nLikewise, the\nobligations with\nrespect to derivative\ntransactions under\nTitle VII of the Dodd-\nFrank Act depend, in\npart, on the location\nof the counterparties\nto the transaction.\nThe impact of\nregulatory\ndevelopments on our\ncompetitive position\nhas depended and will\ncontinue to depend to\na large extent on the\nmanner in which the\nrequired rulemaking\nand regulatory\nguidance evolve, the\nextent of\ninternational\nconvergence, and the\ndevelopment of market\npractice and\nstructures under the\nevolving regulatory\nregimes, as described\nfurther in\n\u201cRegulation\u201d below.\n\nWe also face intense\ncompetition in\nattracting and\nretaining qualified\nemployees. Our ability\nto continue to compete\neffectively has\ndepended and will\ncontinue to depend\nupon our ability to\nattract new employees,\nretain and motivate\nour existing employees\nand to continue to\ncompensate employees\ncompetitively amid\nintense public and\nregulatory scrutiny on\nthe compensation\npractices of large\nfinancial\ninstitutions,\nincluding in\njurisdictions such as\nNew York State where\nwe are required to\npublish certain\ncompensation\ninformation as part of\nthe employee hiring\nprocess. Our pay\npractices and those of\ncertain of our\ncompetitors are\nsubject to review by,\nand the standards of,\nthe FRB and other\nregulators inside and\noutside the U.S.,\nincluding the\nPrudential Regulation\nAuthority (PRA) and\nthe Financial Conduct\nAuthority (FCA) in the\nU.K. We also compete\nfor employees with\ninstitutions whose pay\npractices are not\nsubject to regulatory\noversight.

GSBE is\ndirectly supervised by\nthe European Central\nBank (ECB) and\nadditionally by BaFin\nand Deutsche\nBundesbank in the\ncontext of the E.U.\nSingle Supervisory\nMechanism.

However,\nthe Basel Committee\u2019s\nstandards do not\nbecome effective in a\njurisdiction until the\nrelevant regulators\nhave adopted rules to\nimplement its\nstandards. The\nimplications of Basel\nCommittee standards\nand related\nregulations for our\nbusinesses depend to a\nlarge extent on their\nimplementation by the\nrelevant regulators\nglobally, and the\nmarket practices and\nstructures that\ndevelop.\n\nCapital and Liquidity\nRequirements. We and\nGS Bank USA are\nsubject to risk-based\nregulatory capital and\nleverage requirements\nthat are calculated in\naccordance with the\nregulations of the FRB\n(Capital Framework).\nThe Capital Framework\nis largely based on\nthe Basel Committee\u2019s\nframework for\nstrengthening the\nregulation,\nsupervision and risk\nmanagement of banks\n(Basel III) and also\nimplements certain\nprovisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act. Under\nthe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\u2019\ntailoring framework,\nwe and GS Bank USA are\nsubject to \u201cCategory\nI\u201d standards because\nwe have been\ndesignated as a global\nsystemically important\nbank (G-SIB).\nAccordingly, we and GS\nBank USA are \u201cAdvanced\napproach\u201d banking\norganizations. Under\nthe Capital Framework,\nwe and GS Bank USA\nmust meet specific\nregulatory capital\nrequirements that\ninvolve quantitative\nmeasures of assets,\nliabilities and\ncertain off-balance\nsheet items. The\nsufficiency of our\ncapital levels is also\nsubject to qualitative\njudgments by\nregulators. We and GS\nBank USA are also\nsubject to liquidity\nrequirements\nestablished by the\nU.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies.\n\nGSBE is subject to\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements\nprescribed in the E.U.\nCapital Requirements\nRegulation, as amended\n(CRR), and the E.U.\nCapital Requirements\nDirective, as amended\n(CRD), which are\nlargely based on Basel\nIII.\n\nGSI and GSIB are\nsubject to the U.K.\ncapital and liquidity\nframeworks prescribed\nin the PRA Rulebook\nand the U.K. Capital\nRequirements\nRegulation, which are\nalso largely based on\nBasel III and are\ngenerally aligned with\nthe E.U. capital and\nliquidity frameworks.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    11  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRisk-Based Capital\nRatios. As Advanced\napproach banking\norganizations, we and\nGS Bank USA calculate\nrisk-based capital\nratios in accordance\nwith both the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules. Both the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules\ninclude minimum risk-\nbased capital\nrequirements and\nadditional capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements that must\nbe satisfied solely\nwith Common Equity\nTier 1 (CET1) capital.\nFailure to satisfy a\nbuffer requirement in\nfull would result in\nconstraints on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary\nexecutive\ncompensation. The\nseverity of the\nconstraints would\ndepend on the amount\nof the shortfall and\nthe organization\u2019s\n\u201celigible retained\nincome,\u201d defined as\nthe greater of (i) net\nincome for the four\npreceding quarters,\nnet of distributions\nand associated tax\neffects not reflected\nin net income; and\n(ii) the average of\nnet income over the\npreceding four\nquarters. For Group\nInc., the capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements consist\nof a 2.5% buffer\n(under the Advanced\nCapital Rules), a\nstress capital buffer\n(SCB) (under the\nStandardized Capital\nRules), and both a\ncountercyclical buffer\nand the G-SIB\nsurcharge (under both\nCapital Rules). For GS\nBank USA, the capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements consist\nof a 2.5% buffer and\nthe countercyclical\ncapital buffer.\n\nIn 2023, the FRB\nissued a proposal to\nimplement a revised\nG-SIB assessment\nmethodology and to\nrevise certain\nsystemic indicators to\nbe based on daily or\nmonthly average values\nduring each year,\ninstead of year-end\nvalues.\n\nThe SCB is based on\nthe results of the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s\nsupervisory stress\ntests and our planned\ncommon stock dividends\nand can change\nsignificantly over\ntime based on the\nresults of the annual\nsupervisory stress\ntests. See \u201cStress\nTests and Capital\nPlanning\u201d below. The\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer is\ndesigned to counteract\nsystemic\nvulnerabilities and\ncurrently applies only\nto banking\norganizations subject\nto Category I, II or\nIII standards,\nincluding us and GS\nBank USA. Several\nother national\nsupervisors also\nrequire\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffers. The\nG-SIB surcharge and\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer\napplicable to us may\nchange in the future,\nincluding due to\nadditional guidance\nfrom our regulators\nand/or positional\nchanges. As a result,\nthe minimum capital\nratios to which we are\nsubject are likely to\nchange over time.\n\nThe capital\nrequirements\napplicable to GSBE,\nGSI and GSIB include\nboth minimum\nrequirements and\nbuffers. See\n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof Operations \u2014\nCapital Management and\nRegulatory Capital\u201d in\nPart II, Item 7 of\nthis Form 10\u2011K and\nNote 20 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Form\n10\u2011K for information\nabout our capital\nratios and those of GS\nBank USA, GSBE, GSI\nand GSIB.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nstandards include\nguidelines for\ncalculating\nincremental capital\nratio requirements for\nbanking institutions\nthat are systemically\nsignificant from a\ndomestic but not\nglobal perspective\n(D-SIBs). Depending on\nhow these guidelines\nare implemented by\nnational regulators,\nthey may apply to\ncertain subsidiaries\nof G-SIBs. These\nguidelines are in\naddition to the\nframework for G-SIBs,\nbut are more\nprinciples-based. The\nU.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nhave not designated\nany D-SIBs. The CRD\nand CRR provide that\ninstitutions that are\nsystemically important\nat the E.U. or member\nstate level, known as\nother systemically\nimportant institutions\n(O-SIIs), may be\nsubject to additional\ncapital ratio\nrequirements,\naccording to their\ndegree of systemic\nimportance (O-SII\nbuffers). BaFin has\nidentified GSBE as an\nO-SII in Germany and\nset an O-SII buffer.\n\nIn the U.K., the PRA\nhas identified Goldman\nSachs Group UK Limited\n(GSG UK), the parent\ncompany of GSI and\nGSIB, as an O-SII but\nhas not applied an\nO-SII buffer.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nhas finalized\nrevisions to the Basel\nIII Capital\nRequirements (Basel\nIII Revisions), and in\n2023, the U.S. federal\nbank regulatory\nagencies proposed a\nrule implementing the\nBasel III Revisions,\nincluding the\nFundamental Review of\nthe Trading Book\n(FRTB). The FRTB,\namong other things,\nrevises the\nstandardized and\ninternal model-based\napproaches used to\ncalculate market risk\nrequirements and\nclarifies the scope of\npositions subject to\nmarket risk capital\nrequirements.\n\nThe U.S. proposal has\na three-year\ntransition period for\nthe calculation of\nExpanded Risk-Based\napproach risk-weighted\nassets (RWAs). The\nproposal includes the\nreplacement of the\nAdvanced approach with\nan Expanded Risk-Based\napproach, which\neliminates the use of\ninternal models to\ncalculate RWAs for\ncredit and operational\nrisk. The proposal\nincorporates the\napplication of the SCB\nrequirements in the\nExpanded Risk-Based\napproach. The credit\nrisk component of the\nExpanded Risk-Based\napproach would include\nnew risk weights for\nmany counterparty and\nexposure types, a\nrevised collateral\nhaircut approach for\ncertain collateralized\ntransactions and\nadditional\nrestrictions for\nrecognizing collateral\nin certain securities\nfinancing\ntransactions. Under\nthe proposed rules,\nthe RWAs for\noperational risk would\nbe calculated\nprimarily based on\nrevenues and\nhistorical losses. In\naddition, the proposal\nintroduces the FRTB,\nwhich would replace\nthe market risk rule\nfor both the\nStandardized and\nExpanded Risk-Based\napproaches and\nintroduce a new credit\nvaluation adjustment\n(CVA) risk RWA\ncalculation for the\nExpanded Risk-Based\napproach.

The FRTB\nrules are currently\nexpected to apply from\nJanuary 2026.\n\nThe PRA issued near\nfinal rules with a\nproposed effective\ndate of January 1,\n2027, implementing\nBasel III Revisions,\nincluding new rules\ncovering the FRTB,\ncredit risk,\ncounterparty credit\nrisk, CVA risk and\noperational risk for\nthe U.K. Under the PRA\nnear final rules, our\nU.K. subsidiaries are\nnot expected to be\nsubject to a floor on\ninternally modeled\ncapital requirements.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nhas published an\nupdated securitization\nframework and a\nrevised G-SIB\nassessment\nmethodology. The U.S.\nfederal bank\nregulatory agencies\u2019\nJuly 2023 proposal\nwould implement the\nupdated securitization\nframework. The updated\nsecuritization\nframework has been\nimplemented in the\nE.U. and U.K.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nhas also published a\nfinal standard on the\nprudential treatment\nof cryptoasset\nexposures. The Basel\nCommittee contemplates\nthat national\nregulators will have\nincorporated the\nstandard into local\ncapital requirements\nby January 1, 2026.\nU.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nand E.U. and U.K.\nauthorities have not\nyet proposed rules\nimplementing the\nstandards.\n\nLeverage Ratios. Under\nthe Capital Framework,\nwe and GS Bank USA are\nsubject to Tier 1\nleverage ratios and\nsupplementary leverage\nratios (SLRs)\nestablished by the\nFRB. As a G-SIB, the\nSLR requirements\napplicable to us\ninclude both a minimum\nrequirement and a\nbuffer requirement,\nwhich operates in the\nsame manner as the\nrisk-based buffer\nrequirements described\nabove.\n\nGSBE and certain of\nour U.K. entities are\nalso subject to\nrequirements relating\nto leverage ratios,\nwhich are generally\nbased on the Basel\nCommittee leverage\nratio standards.\n\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof Operations \u2014\nCapital Management and\nRegulatory Capital\u201d in\nPart II, Item 7 of\nthis Form 10-K and\nNote 20 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Form\n10-K for information\nabout our and GS Bank\nUSA\u2019s Tier 1 leverage\nratios and SLRs, and\nGSI\u2019s leverage ratio.\n\nLiquidity Ratios. The\nBasel Committee\u2019s\nframework for\nliquidity risk\nmeasurement, standards\nand monitoring\nrequires banking\norganizations to\nmeasure their\nliquidity against two\nspecific liquidity\ntests: the Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR)\nand the Net Stable\nFunding Ratio (NSFR).\n\nThe LCR rule issued by\nthe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nand applicable to both\nus and GS Bank USA is\ngenerally consistent\nwith the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s framework\nand is designed to\nensure that a banking\norganization maintains\nan adequate level of\nunencumbered, high-\nquality liquid assets\nequal to or greater\nthan the expected net\ncash outflows under an\nacute short-term\nliquidity stress\nscenario. We and GS\nBank USA are required\nto maintain a minimum\nLCR of 100%.\n\nGSBE is subject to the\nLCR rule approved by\nthe European\nParliament and\nCouncil, and GSI and\nGSIB are subject to\nthe U.K. regulatory\nauthorities\u2019 LCR\nrules, which are\ngenerally consistent\nwith the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s framework.\n\nThe NSFR is designed\nto promote medium- and\nlong-term stable\nfunding of the assets\nand off-balance sheet\nactivities of banking\norganizations over a\none-year time horizon.\nThe Basel Committee\u2019s\nNSFR framework\nrequires banking\norganizations to\nmaintain a minimum\nNSFR of 100%. We and\nGS Bank USA are\nsubject to the U.S.\nNSFR rule.\n\nThe CRR implements the\nNSFR for certain E.U.\nfinancial\ninstitutions,\nincluding GSBE. The\nNSFR requirement\nimplemented in the\nU.K. is applicable to\nboth GSI and GSIB.\n\nThe FRB\u2019s enhanced\nprudential standards\nrequire BHCs with $100\nbillion or more in\ntotal consolidated\nassets to comply with\nenhanced liquidity and\noverall risk\nmanagement standards,\nwhich include\nmaintaining a level of\nhighly liquid assets\nbased on projected\nfunding needs for 30\ndays, and increased\ninvolvement by boards\nof directors in\nliquidity and overall\nrisk management.\nAlthough the liquidity\nrequirement under\nthese rules has some\nsimilarities to the\nLCR, it is a separate\nrequirement. GSBE also\nhas its own liquidity\nplanning process,\nwhich incorporates\ninternally designed\nstress tests and those\nrequired under German\nregulatory\nrequirements and the\nECB Guide to Internal\nLiquidity Adequacy\nAssessment Process\n(ILAAP).

In\nDecember 2024 and\nFebruary 2025, the FRB\nindicated that it\nintends to propose\nsignificant changes to\nthe stress test\nframework in 2025 and,\nfor the 2025 stress\ntest, take steps to\nreduce the volatility\nof results and to\nbegin to improve model\ntransparency. Also in\nDecember 2024, trade\ngroups representing\nmajor U.S. banks,\nincluding us, filed a\nlawsuit against the\nFRB concerning certain\ninadequacies with its\nstress testing\nprocess.\n\nUnder the FRB\u2019s rule\napplicable to BHCs\nwith $100 billion or\nmore in total\nconsolidated assets,\nincluding us, the SCB\napplies to the\nStandardized approach\ncapital requirements.\nThe SCB reflects\nstressed losses\nestimated under the\nsupervisory severely\nadverse scenario of\nthe CCAR stress tests,\nas calculated by the\nFRB, and includes four\nquarters of planned\ncommon stock\ndividends. The SCB,\nwhich is subject to a\n2.5% floor, is\ngenerally effective on\nOctober 1 of each year\nand remains in effect\nuntil October 1 of the\nfollowing year, unless\nit is reset in\nconnection with the\nresubmission of a\ncapital plan.

GSBE also has its\nown capital and stress\ntesting process, which\nincorporates\ninternally designed\nstress tests and those\nrequired under German\nregulatory\nrequirements and the\nECB Guide to Internal\nCapital Adequacy\nAssessment Process\n(ICAAP). In addition,\nGSI and GSIB have\ntheir own capital\nplanning and stress\ntesting processes,\nwhich incorporate\ninternally designed\nstress tests developed\nin accordance with the\nPRA\u2019s ICAAP\nguidelines.\n\nLimitations on the\nPayment of Dividends.\nU.S. federal and state\nlaws impose\nlimitations on the\npayment of dividends\nby U.S. depository\ninstitutions, such as\nGS Bank USA. In\ngeneral, the amount of\ndividends that may be\npaid by GS Bank USA is\nlimited to the lesser\nof the amounts\ncalculated under a\nrecent earnings test\nand an undivided\nprofits test. Under\nthe recent earnings\ntest, a dividend may\nnot be paid if the\ntotal of all dividends\ndeclared by the entity\nin any calendar year\nis in excess of the\ncurrent year\u2019s net\nincome combined with\nthe retained net\nincome of the two\npreceding years,\nunless the entity\nobtains regulatory\napproval. Under the\nundivided profits\ntest, a dividend may\nnot be paid in excess\nof the entity\u2019s\nundivided profits\n(generally,\naccumulated net\nprofits that have not\nbeen paid out as\ndividends or\ntransferred to\nsurplus), unless the\nentity receives\nregulatory and\nstockholder approval.\n\nThe applicable U.S.\nbanking regulators\nhave authority to\nprohibit or limit the\npayment of dividends\nif, in the banking\nregulator\u2019s opinion,\npayment of a dividend\nwould constitute an\nunsafe or unsound\npractice in light of\nthe financial\ncondition of the\nbanking organization.\n\nSource of Strength.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nrequires BHCs to act\nas a source of\nstrength to their U.S.\nbank subsidiaries and\nto commit capital and\nfinancial resources to\nsupport those\nsubsidiaries. This\nsupport may be\nrequired by the FRB at\ntimes when BHCs might\notherwise determine\nnot to provide it.\nCapital loans by a BHC\nto a U.S. subsidiary\nbank are subordinate\nin right of payment to\ndeposits and to\ncertain other\nindebtedness of the\nsubsidiary bank. In\naddition, if a BHC\ncommits to a U.S.\nfederal bank\nregulatory agency that\nit will maintain the\ncapital of its bank\nsubsidiary, whether in\nresponse to the FRB\u2019s\ninvoking its source-\nof-strength authority\nor in response to\nother regulatory\nmeasures, that\ncommitment will be\nassumed by the\nbankruptcy trustee for\nthe BHC and the bank\nwill be entitled to\npriority payment in\nrespect of that\ncommitment, ahead of\nother creditors of the\nBHC.\n                                      \n  14    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We are\nrequired by the FRB\nand the FDIC to submit\na periodic plan for\nour rapid and orderly\nresolution in the\nevent of material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure (resolution\nplan). If these\nregulators jointly\ndetermine that an\ninstitution has failed\nto remediate\nidentified\ndeficiencies in its\nresolution plan or\nthat its resolution\nplan, after any\npermitted\nresubmission, is not\ncredible or would not\nfacilitate an orderly\nresolution under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nthey may jointly\nimpose more stringent\ncapital, leverage or\nliquidity requirements\nor restrictions on\ngrowth, activities or\noperations, or may\njointly order the\ninstitution to divest\nassets or operations,\nin order to facilitate\norderly resolution in\nthe event of failure.\nThe FRB and FDIC\nrequire U.S. G-SIBs to\nsubmit resolution\nplans every two years\n(alternating between\nsubmissions of full\nplans and targeted\nplans that include\nonly select\ninformation). We\nsubmitted our 2023\nresolution plan, which\nwas a full submission,\nin June 2023.

GS Bank\nUSA\u2019s most recent\nresolution plan was\nsubmitted in December\n2023. In June 2024,\nthe FDIC adopted\nrevisions to its rule\nthat requires the\nsubmission of\nresolution plans by\ninsured depository\ninstitutions (IDIs)\nwith $50 billion or\nmore in total assets.\nThese revisions modify\nthe requirements\nregarding the content\nand timing of\nresolution\nsubmissions, as well\nas interim supplements\nto those submissions\nprovided to the FDIC.\nIDIs with $100 billion\nor more in total\nassets, including GS\nBank USA, are required\nto submit full\nresolution plans\nbiennially. GS Bank\nUSA\u2019s next required\nfull submission is due\nby July 1, 2026.\n\nThe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nhave adopted rules\nimposing restrictions\non qualified financial\ncontracts (QFCs)\nentered into by\nG-SIBs. The rules are\nintended to facilitate\nthe orderly resolution\nof a failed G-SIB by\nlimiting the ability\nof the G-SIB to enter\ninto a QFC unless (i)\nthe counterparty\nwaives certain default\nrights in such\ncontract arising upon\nthe entry of the G\u2011SIB\nor one of its\naffiliates into\nresolution, (ii) the\ncontract does not\ncontain enumerated\nprohibitions on the\ntransfer of such\ncontract and/or any\nrelated credit\nenhancement, and (iii)\nthe counterparty\nagrees that the\ncontract will be\nsubject to the special\nresolution regimes set\nforth in the Dodd-\nFrank Act orderly\nliquidation authority\n(OLA) and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Act\n(FDIA), described\nbelow.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe E.U. Bank Recovery\nand Resolution\nDirective (BRRD), as\namended by the BRRD\nII, establishes a\nframework for the\nrecovery and\nresolution of\nfinancial institutions\nin the E.U., such as\nGSBE. The BRRD\nprovides national\nsupervisory\nauthorities with tools\nand powers to pre-\nemptively address\npotential financial\ncrises in order to\npromote financial\nstability and minimize\ntaxpayers\u2019 exposure to\nlosses. The BRRD\nrequires E.U. member\nstates to grant\ncertain resolution\npowers to national\nand, where relevant,\nE.U. resolution\nauthorities, including\nthe power to impose a\ntemporary stay, and to\nrecapitalize a failing\nentity by writing down\nits unsecured debt or\nconverting its\nunsecured debt into\nequity. Financial\ninstitutions in the\nE.U. must provide that\ncontracts governed by\nnon-E.U. law recognize\nthose temporary stay\nand bail-in powers\nunless doing so would\nbe impracticable. GSBE\nis under the direct\nauthority of the\nSingle Resolution\nBoard for resolution\nplanning. E.U. law\nrequires financial\ninstitutions in the\nE.U., including\nsubsidiaries of\nnon-E.U. groups, to\nsubmit recovery plans\nand to assist the\nrelevant resolution\nauthority in\nconstructing\nresolution plans for\nthe E.U. entities.\nGSBE\u2019s primary\nregulator with respect\nto recovery planning\nis the ECB, and it is\nalso regulated by\nBaFin and Deutsche\nBundesbank.\n\nThe U.K. Special\nResolution Regime\nconfers substantially\nthe same powers on the\nBank of England, as\nthe U.K. resolution\nauthority, and\nsubstantially the same\nrequirements on U.K.\nfinancial\ninstitutions. Further,\ncertain U.K. financial\ninstitutions,\nincluding GSI and\nGSIB, are required to\nmeet the Bank of\nEngland\u2019s expectations\ncontained in the U.K.\nResolution Assessment\nFramework, including\nwith respect to loss\nabsorbency,\ncontractual stays,\noperational continuity\nand funding in\nresolution. They are\nalso required by the\nPRA to submit solvent\nwind-down plans on how\nthey could be wound\ndown in a stressed\nenvironment. The PRA\nis also the regulatory\nauthority in the U.K.\nthat supervises\nrecovery planning, and\nGSI and GSIB are each\nrequired to submit\nrecovery plans to the\nPRA.\n\nTotal Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity (TLAC). The\nFRB\u2019s TLAC rule, among\nother things,\nestablishes minimum\nTLAC requirements and\nestablishes minimum\nrequirements for\n\u201celigible long-term\ndebt\u201d (i.e., debt that\nis unsecured, has a\nmaturity of at least\none year from issuance\nand satisfies certain\nadditional criteria).\nIn 2023, the FRB\nproposed to introduce\na minimum denomination\nrequirement for\neligible long-term\ndebt, among other\nchanges.\n\nThe rule also\nprohibits a BHC that\nhas been designated as\na U.S. G-SIB from (i)\nguaranteeing\nsubsidiaries\u2019\nliabilities that are\nsubject to early\ntermination provisions\nif the BHC enters into\nan insolvency or\nreceivership\nproceeding, subject to\nan exception for\nguarantees permitted\nby rules of the U.S.\nfederal bank\nregulatory agencies\nimposing restrictions\non QFCs; (ii)\nincurring liabilities\nguaranteed by\nsubsidiaries; (iii)\nissuing short-term\ndebt to third parties;\nor (iv) entering into\nderivatives and\ncertain other\nfinancial contracts\nwith external\ncounterparties.\n\nAdditionally, the rule\ncaps, at 5% of the\nvalue of the parent\ncompany\u2019s eligible\nTLAC, the amount of\nunsecured non-\ncontingent third-party\nliabilities that are\nnot eligible long-term\ndebt that could rank\nequally with or junior\nto eligible long-term\ndebt.\n\nThe CRR, the BRRD and\nU.K. financial\nservices regime also\nimpose minimum TLAC\nrequirements on\nG-SIBs. For example,\nthe CRR requires E.U.\nsubsidiaries of a\nnon-E.U. G-SIB that\nexceed the threshold\nof 5% of the G-SIB\u2019s\nRWAs, operating income\nor leverage exposure,\nsuch as GSBE, to meet\nrequirements for the\nissuance of\ninstruments to\nqualifying affiliates\n(internal TLAC) in\norder to be able to\ntransfer losses or\notherwise recapitalize\nthose subsidiaries.\nUnder the U.K.\nfinancial services\nregime, GSG UK exceeds\nthe applicable\nthresholds and\ntherefore, it is\nsubject to internal\nTLAC requirements.\n\nThe CRD requires a\nnon-E.U. group with\nmore than \u20ac40 billion\nof assets in the E.U.,\nsuch as us, to have an\nE.U. intermediate\nholding company (E.U.\nIHC) if it has, as in\nour case, two or more\nof certain types of\nE.U. financial\ninstitution\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding broker-\ndealers and banks.

The Dodd-Frank\nAct created a\nresolution regime,\nOLA, for BHCs and\ntheir affiliates that\nare systemically\nimportant. Under OLA,\nthe FDIC may be\nappointed as receiver\nfor the systemically\nimportant institution\nand its failed non-\nbank subsidiaries if,\nupon the\nrecommendation of\napplicable regulators,\nthe U.S. Secretary of\nthe Treasury\ndetermines, among\nother things, that the\ninstitution is in\ndefault or in danger\nof default, that the\ninstitution\u2019s failure\nwould have serious\nadverse effects on the\nU.S. financial system\nand that resolution\nunder OLA would avoid\nor mitigate those\neffects.\n\nIf the FDIC is\nappointed as receiver\nunder OLA, then the\npowers of the\nreceiver, and the\nrights and obligations\nof creditors and other\nparties who have dealt\nwith the institution,\nwould be determined\nunder OLA, and not\nunder the bankruptcy\nor insolvency law that\nwould otherwise apply.\nThe powers of the\nreceiver under OLA are\ngenerally based on the\npowers of the FDIC as\nreceiver for\ndepository\ninstitutions under the\nFDIA, described below.\n\nSubstantial\ndifferences in the\nrights of creditors\nexist between OLA and\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, including the\nright of the FDIC\nunder OLA to disregard\nthe strict priority of\ncreditor claims in\nsome circumstances,\nthe use of an\nadministrative claims\nprocedure to determine\ncreditors\u2019 claims (as\nopposed to the\njudicial procedure\nutilized in bankruptcy\nproceedings), and the\nright of the FDIC to\ntransfer claims to a\n\u201cbridge\u201d entity. In\naddition, OLA limits\nthe ability of\ncreditors to enforce\ncertain contractual\ncross-defaults against\naffiliates of the\ninstitution in\nreceivership. The FDIC\nhas issued a notice\nthat it would likely\nresolve a failed FHC\nby transferring its\nassets to a \u201cbridge\u201d\nholding company under\nits \u201csingle point of\nentry\u201d or \u201cSPOE\u201d\nstrategy pursuant to\nOLA.\n\nUnder the FDIA, if the\nFDIC is appointed as\nconservator or\nreceiver for an IDI\nsuch as GS Bank USA,\nupon its insolvency or\nin certain other\nevents, the FDIC has\nbroad powers,\nincluding the power:\n\n\u2022 To transfer any of\nthe IDI\u2019s assets and\nliabilities to a new\nobligor, including a\nnewly formed \u201cbridge\u201d\nbank, without the\napproval of the\ndepository\ninstitution\u2019s\ncreditors;\n\n\u2022 To enforce the IDI\u2019s\ncontracts pursuant to\ntheir terms without\nregard to any\nprovisions triggered\nby the appointment of\nthe FDIC in that\ncapacity; or\n\n\u2022 To repudiate or\ndisaffirm any contract\nor lease to which the\nIDI is a party, the\nperformance of which\nis determined by the\nFDIC to be burdensome\nand the repudiation or\ndisaffirmance of which\nis determined by the\nFDIC to promote the\norderly administration\nof the IDI.\n\nIn addition, the\nclaims of holders of\ndomestic deposit\nliabilities and\ncertain claims for\nadministrative\nexpenses against an\nIDI would be afforded\na priority over other\ngeneral unsecured\nclaims, including\ndeposits at non-U.S.\nbranches and claims of\ndebtholders of the\nIDI, in the\n\u201cliquidation or other\nresolution\u201d of such an\ninstitution by any\nreceiver. As a result,\nwhether or not the\nFDIC ever sought to\nrepudiate any debt\nobligations of GS Bank\nUSA, the debtholders\n(other than depositors\nat U.S. branches)\nwould be treated\ndifferently from, and\ncould receive, if\nanything,\nsubstantially less\nthan, the depositors\nat U.S. branches of GS\nBank USA .\n\nDeposit Insurance.\nDeposits at GS Bank\nUSA have the benefit\nof FDIC insurance up\nto the applicable\nlimits. The FDIC\u2019s\nDeposit Insurance Fund\nis funded by\nassessments on IDIs.\nGS Bank USA\u2019s\nassessment (subject to\nadjustment by the\nFDIC) is currently\nbased on its average\ntotal consolidated\nassets less its\naverage tangible\nequity during the\nassessment period, its\nsupervisory ratings\nand specified forward-\nlooking financial\nmeasures used to\ncalculate the\nassessment rate. In\naddition, the FDIC\nmust recover, by\nspecial assessment,\nlosses to the FDIC\ndeposit insurance fund\nas a result of the\nFDIC\u2019s use of the\nsystemic risk\nexception to the least\ncost resolution test\nunder the FDIA.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nPrompt Corrective\nAction. The U.S.\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nImprovement Act of\n1991 (FDICIA) requires\nthe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies to\ntake \u201cprompt\ncorrective action\u201d in\nrespect of depository\ninstitutions that do\nnot meet specified\ncapital requirements.\nFDICIA establishes\nfive capital\ncategories for FDIC-\ninsured banks, such as\nGS Bank USA: well-\ncapitalized,\nadequately\ncapitalized,\nundercapitalized,\nsignificantly\nundercapitalized and\ncritically\nundercapitalized.\n\nAn institution may be\ndowngraded to, or\ndeemed to be in, a\ncapital category that\nis lower than is\nindicated by its\ncapital ratios if it\nis determined to be in\nan unsafe or unsound\ncondition or if it\nreceives an\nunsatisfactory\nexamination rating\nwith respect to\ncertain matters.\nFDICIA imposes\nprogressively more\nrestrictive\nconstraints on\noperations, management\nand capital\ndistributions, as the\ncapital category of an\ninstitution declines.\nFailure to meet the\ncapital requirements\ncould also require a\ndepository institution\nto raise capital.\nUltimately, critically\nundercapitalized\ninstitutions are\nsubject to the\nappointment of a\nreceiver or\nconservator, as\ndescribed in\n\u201cInsolvency of an IDI\nor a BHC\u201d above.\n\nThe prompt corrective\naction regulations do\nnot apply to BHCs.\nHowever, the FRB is\nauthorized to take\nappropriate action at\nthe BHC level, based\nupon the\nundercapitalized\nstatus of the BHC\u2019s\ndepository institution\nsubsidiaries. In\ncertain instances,\nrelating to an\nundercapitalized\ndepository institution\nsubsidiary, the BHC\nwould be required to\nguarantee the\nperformance of the\nundercapitalized\nsubsidiary\u2019s capital\nrestoration plan and\nmight be liable for\ncivil money damages\nfor failure to fulfill\nits commitments on\nthat guarantee.\nFurthermore, in the\nevent of the\nbankruptcy of the BHC,\nthe guarantee would\ntake priority over the\nBHC\u2019s general\nunsecured creditors,\nas described in\n\u201cSource of Strength\u201d\nabove.\n\nVolcker Rule and Other\nRestrictions on\nActivities. As a BHC,\nwe are subject to\nlimitations on the\ntypes of business\nactivities in which we\nmay engage.\n\nVolcker Rule. The\nVolcker Rule prohibits\n\u201cproprietary trading,\u201d\nbut permits activities\nsuch as underwriting,\nmarket making and\nrisk-mitigation\nhedging, requires an\nextensive compliance\nprogram and includes\nadditional reporting\nand record-keeping\nrequirements.\n\nIn addition, the\nVolcker Rule limits\nthe sponsorship of,\nand investment in,\n\u201ccovered funds\u201d (as\ndefined in the rule)\nby banking entities,\nincluding us. It also\nlimits certain types\nof transactions\nbetween us and our\nsponsored and advised\nfunds, similar to the\nlimitations on\ntransactions between\ndepository\ninstitutions and their\naffiliates. Covered\nfunds include our\nprivate equity funds,\ncertain of our credit\nand real estate funds,\nour hedge funds and\ncertain other\ninvestment structures.\nThe limitation on\ninvestments in covered\nfunds requires us to\nlimit our investment\nin each such fund to\n3% or less of the\nfund\u2019s net asset\nvalue, and to limit\nour aggregate\ninvestment in all such\nfunds to 3% or less of\nour Tier 1 capital.\n\nOther Restrictions.\nFHCs generally can\nengage in a broader\nrange of financial and\nrelated activities\nthan are otherwise\npermissible for BHCs\nas long as they\ncontinue to meet the\neligibility\nrequirements for FHCs.\nThe broader range of\npermissible activities\nfor FHCs includes\nunderwriting, dealing\nand making markets in\nsecurities and making\ninvestments in non-\nFHCs (merchant banking\nactivities). In\naddition, certain\nFHCs, including us,\nare permitted to\nengage in certain\ncommodities activities\nin the U.S. that may\notherwise be\nimpermissible for\nBHCs, so long as the\nassets held pursuant\nto these activities do\nnot equal 5% or more\nof their consolidated\nassets.\n\nThe FRB, however, has\nthe authority to limit\nan FHC\u2019s ability to\nconduct activities\nthat would otherwise\nbe permissible, and\nwill likely do so if\nthe FHC does not\nsatisfactorily meet\ncertain requirements\nof the FRB. For\nexample, if an FHC or\nany of its U.S.\ndepository institution\nsubsidiaries ceases to\nmaintain its status as\nwell-capitalized or\nwell-managed, the FRB\nmay impose corrective\ncapital and/or\nmanagerial\nrequirements, as well\nas additional\nlimitations or\nconditions. If the\ndeficiencies persist,\nthe FHC may be\nrequired to divest its\nU.S. depository\ninstitution\nsubsidiaries or to\ncease engaging in\nactivities other than\nthe business of\nbanking and certain\nclosely related\nactivities.\n\nIn addition, we are\nrequired to obtain\nprior FRB approval\nbefore certain\nacquisitions and\nbefore engaging in\ncertain banking and\nother financial\nactivities both within\nand outside the U.S.\n\nU.S. G-SIBs, like us,\nare also required to\ncomply with a rule\nregarding single\ncounterparty credit\nlimits, which imposes\nmore stringent\nrequirements for\ncredit exposures to\nmajor financial\ninstitutions.\n\nThe New York State\nbanking law imposes\nlending limits (which\ntake into account\ncredit exposure from\nderivative\ntransactions) and\nother requirements\nthat have in the past\nimpacted and could in\nthe future impact the\nmanner and scope of GS\nBank USA\u2019s activities.\n                                      \n  18    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

GS Bank USA\ninstead adopted a\nstrategic plan that\nwas approved by the\nFRB and NYDFS. The\n2023 strategic plan\nwill be in effect\nthrough 2028. While\nthe plan is in effect,\nits terms will not be\nimpacted by the\nrevised federal CRA\nregulations, jointly\npublished by the FDIC,\nFRB, and OCC in 2023.\nThe revised federal\nCRA regulations tailor\nCRA evaluations to\nbank size and type,\nwith many of the\nchanges applying only\nto banks with over $2\nbillion in assets and\nseveral applying only\nto banks with over $10\nbillion in assets,\nincluding GS Bank USA.\nA court has issued a\npreliminary injunction\nenjoining the U.S.\nfederal bank\nregulatory agencies\nfrom enforcing the\nrevised regulations\npending resolution of\nthe lawsuit\nchallenging the\nregulations.\n\nThe CRA does not\nestablish specific\nlending requirements\nor programs for\nfinancial institutions\nnor does it limit an\ninstitution\u2019s\ndiscretion to develop\nthe types of products\nand services that it\nbelieves are best\nsuited to its\nparticular community,\nbut depository\ninstitutions may only\nreceive CRA credit for\ncertain types of\nlending and for\nlending, investments\nand services that\nsupport community\ndevelopment, as\ndefined in the CRA\nregulations. The CRA\nand its regulations\nrequire each\nappropriate federal\nbank regulatory\nagency, in connection\nwith its examination\nof a depository\ninstitution, to assess\nsuch institution\u2019s\nrecord of meeting the\ncredit needs of the\ncommunities served by\nthat institution,\nincluding the needs of\nlow- and moderate-\nincome borrowers and\nneighborhoods, and to\nmake such assessment\navailable to the\npublic.\n\nThe assessment also is\npart of the FRB\u2019s\nconsideration of\napplications to\nacquire, merge or\nconsolidate with\nanother banking\ninstitution or its\nholding company, to\nassume deposits of or\nacquire assets from\nanother depository\ninstitution, to\nestablish a new\ndomestic branch office\nthat will raise\ndeposits, or to\nrelocate an office. In\nthe case of a BHC\napplying for approval\nto acquire a bank or\nanother BHC, the FRB\nwill assess the\nrecords of performance\nunder the CRA of the\nIDIs involved in the\ntransaction, and such\nrecords may be the\nbasis for denying the\napplication.\n\nIf GS Bank USA fails\nto maintain at least a\n\u201csatisfactory\u201d rating\nunder the CRA, we\nwould be subject to\nrestrictions on\ncertain new activities\nand acquisitions.\n\nWe are also subject to\nprovisions of the New\nYork Banking Law that\nimpose continuing and\naffirmative\nobligations upon New\nYork State-chartered\nbanks, such as GS Bank\nUSA, to serve the\ncredit needs of its\nlocal community\n(NYCRA). Such\nobligations are\nsubstantially similar\nto those imposed by\nthe CRA. The NYCRA\nrequires the NYDFS to\nmake a periodic\nwritten assessment of\nan institution\u2019s\ncompliance with the\nNYCRA, and to make\nsuch assessment\navailable to the\npublic.

The\nguidance sets forth\nthe following three\nkey principles with\nrespect to incentive\ncompensation\narrangements: (i) the\narrangements should\nprovide employees with\nincentives that\nappropriately balance\nrisk and financial\nresults in a manner\nthat does not\nencourage employees to\nexpose their\norganizations to\nimprudent risk; (ii)\nthe arrangements\nshould be compatible\nwith effective\ncontrols and risk\nmanagement; and (iii)\nthe arrangements\nshould be supported by\nstrong corporate\ngovernance. The\nguidance provides that\nsupervisory findings\nwith respect to\nincentive compensation\nwill be incorporated,\nas appropriate, into\nthe organization\u2019s\nsupervisory ratings,\nwhich can affect its\nability to make\nacquisitions or\nperform other actions.\nThe guidance also\nnotes that enforcement\nactions may be taken\nagainst a banking\norganization if its\nincentive compensation\narrangements or\nrelated risk\nmanagement, control or\ngovernance processes\npose a risk to the\norganization\u2019s safety\nand soundness.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nrequires U.S.\nfinancial regulators,\nincluding the FRB and\nSEC, to adopt rules on\nincentive-based\npayment arrangements\nat specified regulated\nentities having at\nleast $1 billion in\ntotal assets. The U.S.\nfinancial regulators\nproposed revised rules\nin 2016, which have\nnot been finalized. In\naccordance with an SEC\nrule, securities\nexchanges have adopted\nrules mandating, in\nthe case of a\nrestatement, the\nrecovery or \u201cclawback\u201d\nof excess incentive-\nbased compensation\npaid to current or\nformer executive\nofficers and requiring\nlisted issuers to\ndisclose any recovery\nanalysis where\nrecovery is triggered\nby a restatement.\n\nThe NYDFS\u2019 guidance\nemphasizes that any\nincentive compensation\narrangements tied to\nemployee performance\nindicators at banking\ninstitutions regulated\nby the NYDFS,\nincluding GS Bank USA,\nmust be subject to\neffective risk\nmanagement, oversight\nand control.\n\nIn the E.U., certain\nprovisions in the CRR\nand CRD are designed\nto meet the FSB\u2019s\ncompensation\nstandards. These\nprovisions limit the\nratio of variable to\nfixed compensation of\nall employees at GSBE\nand of certain\nemployees at our other\noperating subsidiaries\nin the E.U., including\nthose employees\nidentified as having a\nmaterial impact on the\nrisk profile of\nregulated entities.\nCRR II and CRD V\namended certain\naspects of these\nrules, including, by\nincreasing minimum\nvariable compensation\ndeferral periods.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    23  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Through\nthese and other\nprovisions, the BSA\nseeks, among other\nthings, to promote the\nidentification of\nparties that may be\ninvolved in terrorism,\nmoney laundering or\nother suspicious\nactivities.\n\nThe AMLA was intended\nto comprehensively\nreform and modernize\nU.S. anti-money\nlaundering laws. Among\nother things, the AMLA\ncodifies a risk-based\napproach to anti-money\nlaundering compliance\nfor financial\ninstitutions; requires\nthe U.S. Department of\nthe Treasury to\nperiodically\npromulgate priorities\nfor anti-money\nlaundering and\ncountering the\nfinancing of\nterrorism; requires\nthe development of\nstandards by the U.S.\nDepartment of the\nTreasury for testing\ntechnology and\ninternal processes for\nBSA compliance;\nexpands enforcement-\nand investigation-\nrelated authority,\nincluding a\nsignificant expansion\nin the available\nsanctions for certain\nBSA violations; and\nexpands BSA\nwhistleblower\nincentives and\nprotections. Certain\nstatutory provisions\nin the AMLA require\nrulemakings beyond\nthose that have\nalready been\nfinalized, reports and\nother measures. The\nimpact of the AMLA\nwill depend on, among\nother things, these\nadditional rulemakings\nand implementation\nguidance. The\nFinancial Crimes\nEnforcement Network\n(FinCEN), a bureau of\nthe U.S. Department of\nTreasury, has issued\nthe priorities for\nanti-money laundering\nand countering the\nfinancing of\nterrorism, as required\nunder the AMLA. The\npriorities include:\ncorruption,\ncybercrime, terrorist\nfinancing, fraud,\ntransnational crime,\ndrug trafficking\norganization activity,\nhuman trafficking and\nproliferation\nfinancing.\n\nThe Corporate\nTransparency Act (CTA)\nwas enacted in 2021 as\npart of the AMLA and\ndesigned to establish\nbeneficial ownership\ninformation reporting\nrequirements for\ncertain types of\nentities, and in 2024,\nFinCEN\u2019s rule\nimplementing the\nreporting requirements\nof the CTA became\neffective. Under the\nrule, domestic\ncompanies formed\nbefore 2024 would be\nrequired to file their\ninitial report by\nJanuary 1, 2025 and\ndomestic companies\nformed in or after\n2024 would be required\nto file their initial\nreport within,\nrespectively, 90 or 30\ndays of their\nformation, in each\ncase subject to\ncertain exemptions. On\nFebruary 19, 2025,\nFinCEN announced that\nthe earliest initial\nreporting deadline is\nMarch 21, 2025.\n\nIn 2024, FinCEN and\nthe SEC proposed a\nrule that would\nrequire certain\ninvestment advisers to\nimplement reasonable\nprocedures to identify\nand verify the\nidentities of their\ncustomers. In 2024,\nFinCEN proposed to\namend the anti-money\nlaundering/countering\nthe financing of\nterrorism (AML/CFT)\nprogram requirements\nfor all financial\ninstitutions subject\nto the BSA that have\nAML/CFT program\nobligations, including\nus. The proposal\nwould, among other\nthings, require a\nfinancial\ninstitution\u2019s risk\nassessment process to\nidentify, evaluate and\ndocument the financial\ninstitution\u2019s money\nlaundering, terrorist\nfinancing and other\nillicit activity\nrisks, and update such\nrisk assessments on a\nperiodic basis. In\n2024, the U.S. federal\nbank regulatory\nagencies proposed\namendments to their\nrespective BSA program\nrules to align those\nrules with the FinCEN\nproposal. FinCEN has\nalso adopted a rule,\neffective on January\n1, 2026, that includes\ncertain investment\nadvisers, such as us,\nin the definition of\n\u201cfinancial\ninstitutions\u201d under\nFinCEN\u2019s rules\nimplementing the BSA\nand, among other\nthings, prescribes\nminimum standards for\nAML/CFT programs to be\nestablished by such\ninvestment advisers\nand requires them to\nreport suspicious\nactivity to FinCEN.\n\nWe are subject to\nother laws and\nregulations worldwide\nrelating to anti-money\nlaundering and\nfinancial\ntransparency,\nincluding the E.U.\nAnti-Money Laundering\nDirectives.

The\nproposed amendments to\nRegulation SCI would,\namong other things,\nexpand the types of\nentities covered by\nthe regulation,\nrequire additional\npolicies and\nprocedures to address\ncybersecurity risks,\nand require disclosure\nof additional types of\ncybersecurity events\nto the SEC.\n\nIn 2024, the SEC\namended Regulation S-P\nthat implements the\nGLB Act. The\namendments to\nRegulation S-P require\nbroker-dealers,\ninvestment companies\nand investment\nadvisers registered\nwith the SEC to adopt\nwritten policies and\nprocedures for\nincident response\nprograms to address\nunauthorized access to\nor use of customer\ninformation.

In 2024, the\nCalifornia Privacy\nProtection Agency\nproposed regulations\nunder the CCPA\nrelating to\ncybersecurity audits,\nrisk assessments, and\nautomated decision-\nmaking technology.\n\nOur businesses are\nalso subject to laws\nand regulations\ngoverning\ncybersecurity and\nrelated risks, and\nwhich require\nregulatory\ndisclosures, and, in\nsome instances,\nindividual\ndisclosures, of\ncertain security\nincidents. These\ninclude, but are not\nlimited to, the NYDFS\nCybersecurity\nRequirements for\nFinancial Services\nCompanies. The NYDFS\nalso requires\nfinancial institutions\nregulated by the\nNYDFS, including GS\nBank USA, to, among\nother things, (i)\nestablish and maintain\na cybersecurity\nprogram designed to\nensure the\nconfidentiality,\nintegrity and\navailability of their\ninformation systems;\n(ii) implement and\nmaintain a written\ncybersecurity policy\nsetting forth policies\nand procedures for the\nprotection of their\ninformation systems\nand nonpublic\ninformation; and (iii)\ndesignate a Chief\nInformation Security\nOfficer. In 2023, the\nNYDFS adopted\namendments to its\ncybersecurity\nregulations that will\nimpose heightened or\nadditional\nrequirements with\nrespect to\ncybersecurity incident\nnotifications, risk\nmanagement and\ngovernance. Most of\nthese amendments\nbecame effective in\n2024 although certain\namendments have a\nlonger transition\nperiod and become\neffective in 2025.\n\nIn 2023, the E.U.\nDigital Operational\nResilience Act (DORA)\nbecame effective and\napplies from January\n2025. DORA requires\nE.U. financial\nentities, such as\nGSBE, to have a\ncomprehensive\ngovernance and control\nframework for the\nmanagement of\ninformation and\ncommunications\ntechnology risk. In\naddition, in 2024, the\nE.U. Artificial\nIntelligence Act (E.U.\nAI Act) became\neffective. Certain\nprovisions of the E.U.\nAI Act apply from\nFebruary 2025, with\nother provisions\napplying between\nAugust 2025 and August\n2027. The E.U. AI Act\nestablishes rules for\nplacing on the market,\nputting into service,\nand using artificial\nintelligence systems\nin the E.U.\n\nIn 2024, the CFPB\nadopted a rule\nregarding personal\nfinancial data rights\nthat requires\nfinancial institutions\nthat offer consumer\ndeposit accounts and\nissue credit cards,\nsuch as GS Bank USA,\nto provide consumers\nelectronic access to\nat least 24 months of\ntransaction data and\ncertain account\ninformation and are\nprohibited from\nimposing any fees or\ncharges for\nmaintaining or\nproviding access to\nsuch data. The rule\nalso imposes data\naccuracy, retention\nand other obligations,\nand data use\nlimitations and other\nobligations on\nentities obtaining\naccess to such\npersonal financial\ndata, such as GS&Co.\nThe current compliance\ndeadline for large\nfinancial\ninstitutions,\nincluding GS Bank USA,\nis April 1, 2026.\nHowever, this timeline\nis potentially subject\nto change as a result\nof CFPB action or\ncurrently pending\nlitigation.\n\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof Operations \u2014 Risk\nManagement \u2014\nCybersecurity Risk\nManagement\u201d in Part\nII, Item 7 of this\nForm 10\u2011K for further\ninformation about our\ncybersecurity risk\nmanagement, strategy\nand governance.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    25  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nprinciples are\nintended to support\nefforts by large\nfinancial institutions\nto focus on key\naspects of climate-\nrelated financial risk\nmanagement and consist\nof six general\nprinciples: (1)\ngovernance; (2)\npolicies, procedures,\nand limits; (3)\nstrategic planning;\n(4) risk management;\n(5) data, risk\nmeasurement, and\nreporting; and (6)\nscenario analysis. In\n2023, the SEC adopted\namendments to Rule\n35d-1 (Names Rule)\nunder the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940.\nThe previous Names\nRule generally\nrequired a fund with a\nname suggesting a\nfocus in a particular\ntype of investment, or\nin investments in a\nparticular industry or\ngeographic region, to\nadopt a policy to\ninvest at least 80% of\nthe value of its\nassets in the type of\ninvestment, or in\ninvestments in the\nindustry, country or\ngeographic region,\nsuggested by its name.\nThe amendments expand\nsuch 80% investment\npolicy to apply to any\nfund name with terms\nsuggesting that the\nfund focuses in\ninvestments that have,\nor investments whose\nissuers have,\nparticular\ncharacteristics,\nincluding names that\nsuggest the fund\nincorporates ESG\nfactors in its\ninvestment decisions.\nIn 2022, the SEC\nproposed a rule that\nwould require enhanced\ndisclosures by certain\ninvestment advisers\nand investment\ncompanies about their\nESG investment\npractices.\n\nIn 2024, the SEC\nadopted final rules\nrequiring registrants\nto provide certain\nclimate-related\ndisclosures, including\nScope 1 and Scope 2\ngreenhouse gas\nemissions to the\nextent they are\nmaterial. These rules\nrequire certain\ndisclosures related to\nsevere weather events\nand other natural\nconditions in the\nnotes to audited\nfinancial statements.\nThese disclosures are\nrequired to be phased-\nin over multiple years\nbeginning with fiscal\nyear 2025 for large\naccelerated filers\nlike us. However, the\nSEC has stayed the\nimplementation of\nthese rules, pending\nthe outcome of\nlitigation challenging\nthe rules.\n\nSeveral states in\nwhich we operate have\nenacted or proposed\nstatutes, regulations\nor guidance addressing\nclimate change and\nother ESG issues,\nincluding climate\ndisclosure laws and\nclimate-related\nfinancial risk\nmanagement guidance.\nFor example, in 2023,\nthe NYDFS issued\nguidance on climate-\nrelated financial risk\nmanagement applicable\nto NYDFS-regulated\nbanking and mortgage\norganizations,\nincluding GS Bank USA.\nThe guidance addresses\nmaterial financial\nrisks related to\nclimate change faced\nby these organizations\nin the context of risk\nassessment, risk\nmanagement, and risk\nappetite setting.\n\nCertain states have\nalso enacted, or are\nconsidering enacting,\n\u201cfair access\u201d statutes\nthat generally\nprohibit financial\ninstitutions from\ndenying or canceling\nservices on the basis\nof factors, such as\npolitical opinions,\nreligious beliefs,\n\u201csocial credit\nscores,\u201d or any factor\nthat is not\nquantitative,\nimpartial, and risk-\nbased.\n\nCertain of our\nentities are expected\nto be subject, in\nvarying degrees, to\nsustainability-related\nlaws being implemented\nacross certain\njurisdictions,\nincluding by E.U.\nmember states. E.U.\nrules include\ndirectives, such as\nthe Corporate\nSustainability\nReporting Directive\n(CSRD) and the\nCorporate\nSustainability Due\nDiligence Directive\n(CSDDD), both of which\nwould, if implemented\nin current form,\nsignificantly expand\nthe scope of ESG\ndisclosure\nrequirements\napplicable to us.\nThere remains\nuncertainty around\ntiming, scope and\nimpacts to us, as\nnumerous member states\nhave not yet\ntransposed some of\nthese directives into\nnational law, and the\nEuropean Commission\nstated its intention\nto revisit these\ndirectives, among\npotentially others,\nwith a desire to\npursue an Omnibus\npackage, which could\nimpact us. Our\nregulated banking\nsubsidiaries in the\nE.U. are also subject\nto supervisory\nexpectations and\npotential enforcement\nactions for, among\nothers, the management\nof climate-related\nfinancial risks and\nrelated disclosure.\n\nThe CRR and the E.U.\nmember states\u2019\nlegislation\nimplementing CRD\nrequire large\ninstitutions with\nsecurities traded on a\nregulated market of a\nmember state to make\nqualitative and\nquantitative\ndisclosures relating\nto environmental,\nsocial and governance\nrisks on a semi-annual\nbasis. GSBE is\nexpected to become\nsubject to this\nrequirement in January\n2026.\n\nIn 2021, the FCA\nintroduced mandatory\nTaskforce on Climate-\nrelated Financial\nDisclosures\n(TCFD)-aligned\ndisclosure\nrequirements for\ncertain FCA-regulated\nfirms, including GSI\nand GSAMI. These\nentities are also\nsubject to climate-\nrelated financial\ndisclosures required\nunder the U.K.\nCompanies Act. In\naddition, during 2024,\nnew FCA rules on\nsustainability\nrequirements and\ninvestment labels\nbecame effective. We\ncontinue to assess the\nimpact of other ESG-\nrelated regulatory\nframeworks that will,\nor are proposed to, in\nthe future apply to\nour FCA- and/or PRA-\nregulated\nsubsidiaries. Our PRA-\nregulated banking\nsubsidiaries are also\nsubject to the PRA\u2019s\nsupervisory\nexpectations for the\nmanagement of climate-\nrelated financial\nrisks, including with\nrespect to governance,\nrisk management,\nscenario analysis and\ndisclosure.\n                                      \n  26    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

A default by\nthe U.S. could result\nin unprecedented\nmarket volatility and\nilliquidity,\nheightened operational\nrisks relating to the\nclearance and\nsettlement of\ntransactions, margin\nand other disputes\nwith clients and\ncounterparties, an\nadverse impact to\ninvestors including\nmoney market funds\nthat invest in U.S.\nTreasuries, downgrades\nin the U.S. credit\nrating, further\nincreases in interest\nrates and borrowing\ncosts and a recession\nin the U.S. or other\neconomies. Continued\nuncertainty relating\nto the debt ceiling\ncould result in\ndowngrades of the U.S.\ncredit rating, which\ncould adversely affect\nmarket conditions,\nlead to margin\ndisputes, increases in\ninterest rates and\nborrowing costs and\nnecessitate\nsignificant\noperational changes\namong market\nparticipants,\nincluding us. A\ndowngrade of the U.S.\nfederal government\u2019s\ncredit rating could\nalso materially and\nadversely affect the\nmarket for repurchase\nagreements, securities\nborrowing and lending,\nand other financings\ntypically\ncollateralized by U.S.\nTreasury or agency\nobligations. Further,\nthe fair value,\nliquidity and credit\nratings of securities\nissued by, or other\nobligations of,\nagencies of the U.S.\ngovernment or related\nto the U.S. government\nor its agencies, as\nwell as municipal\nbonds could be\nsimilarly adversely\naffected. An\nincreasing frequency\nof government\nshutdowns, or near\nshutdowns, in the U.S.\ncould also lead to\nuncertainty as to the\ncontinued funding of\nthe U.S. government,\nwhich could, in turn,\nadversely affect the\ncredit ratings of the\nU.S. and the market\nfor U.S. Treasury or\nagency obligations.\n\nIn 2024, numerous\nelections were held\nglobally, including\nthe recent U.S.\npresidential election.\nThe outcomes of the\nelections are expected\nto result in changes\nin policy, which could\nalso have adverse\neffects on us or the\nbusiness environment\nin which we operate\nmore generally. For\nexample, the new U.S.\npresidential\nadministration has\nimposed or increased\ntariffs, including on\nimports from China,\nand proposed imposing\nor increasing tariffs\non U.S. trading\npartners, which could\nadversely affect\nmarkets, the business\nenvironment and some\nof our businesses.\n\nOur businesses have\nbeen and may in the\nfuture be adversely\naffected by declining\nasset values,\nparticularly where we\nhave net \u201clong\u201d\npositions, receive\nfees based on the\nvalue of assets\nmanaged, or receive or\npost collateral.\n\nMany of our businesses\nhave net \u201clong\u201d\npositions in debt\nsecurities, loans,\nderivatives,\nmortgages, equities\n(including private\nequity and real\nestate) and most other\nasset classes. These\ninclude positions we\ntake when we act as a\nprincipal to\nfacilitate our\nclients\u2019 activities,\nincluding our\nexchange-based market-\nmaking activities, or\ncommit large amounts\nof capital to maintain\npositions in interest\nrate and credit\nproducts, as well as\nthrough our\ncurrencies,\ncommodities, equities\nand mortgage-related\nactivities. In\naddition, we invest in\nsimilar asset classes.\nSubstantially all of\nour investing and\nmarket-making\npositions and a\nportion of our loans\nare marked-to-market\non a daily or other\nperiodic basis and\ndeclines in asset\nvalues directly and\npromptly impact our\nearnings, unless we\nhave effectively\n\u201chedged\u201d our exposures\nto those declines.\n\nIn certain\ncircumstances, it may\nnot be possible or\neconomic to hedge our\nexposures and, to the\nextent that we do so,\nthe hedge may be\nineffective or may\ngreatly reduce our\nability to profit from\nincreases in the\nvalues of the assets.\nThis is particularly\nthe case for credit\nproducts, including\nleveraged loans, and\nprivate equities or\nother securities that\nare not freely\ntradable or lack\nestablished and liquid\ntrading markets.\nSudden declines and\nsignificant volatility\nin the prices of\nassets have in the\npast substantially\ncurtailed or\neliminated, and may in\nthe future\nsubstantially curtail\nor eliminate, the\ntrading markets for\ncertain assets, which\nmay make it difficult\nto sell, hedge or\nvalue such assets. We\nmay incur losses from\ntime to time as\ntrading markets\ndeteriorate or cease\nto function, including\nwith respect to loan\ncommitments we have\nmade or securities\nofferings we have\nunderwritten. The\ninability to sell or\neffectively hedge\nassets reduces our\nability to limit\nlosses in such\npositions and the\ndifficulty in valuing\nassets has in the past\nnegatively affected,\nand may in the future\nnegatively affect, our\ncapital, liquidity or\nleverage ratios, our\nfunding costs and our\nability to deploy\ncapital.\n\nIn our exchange-based\nmarket-making\nactivities, we are\nobligated by stock\nexchange rules to\nmaintain an orderly\nmarket, including by\npurchasing securities\nin a declining market.\nIn markets where asset\nvalues are declining\nand in volatile\nmarkets, this results\nin losses and an\nincreased need for\nliquidity.\n\nWe receive asset-based\nmanagement fees based\non the value of our\nclients\u2019 portfolios or\ninvestment in funds\nmanaged by us and, in\nsome cases, we also\nreceive incentive fees\nbased on increases in\nthe value of such\ninvestments. Declines\nin asset values would\nordinarily reduce the\nvalue of our clients\u2019\nportfolios or fund\nassets, which in turn\nwould typically reduce\nthe fees we earn for\nmanaging such assets.\n                                      \n  34    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe post collateral to\nsupport our\nobligations and\nreceive collateral\nthat supports the\nobligations of our\nclients and\ncounterparties. When\nthe value of the\nassets posted as\ncollateral or the\ncredit ratings of the\nparty posting\ncollateral decline,\nthe party posting the\ncollateral may need to\nprovide additional\ncollateral or, if\npossible, reduce its\ntrading position. An\nexample of such a\nsituation is a \u201cmargin\ncall\u201d in connection\nwith a brokerage\naccount. Therefore,\ndeclines in the value\nof asset classes used\nas collateral mean\nthat either the cost\nof funding positions\nis increased or the\nsize of positions is\ndecreased. If we are\nthe party providing\ncollateral, this can\nincrease our costs and\nreduce our\nprofitability and if\nwe are the party\nreceiving collateral,\nthis can also reduce\nour profitability by\nreducing the level of\nbusiness done with our\nclients and\ncounterparties.\n\nIn addition, volatile\nor less liquid markets\nincrease the\ndifficulty of valuing\nassets, which can lead\nto costly and time-\nconsuming disputes\nover asset values and\nthe level of required\ncollateral, as well as\nincreased credit risk\nto the recipient of\nthe collateral due to\ndelays in receiving\nadequate collateral.\nIn cases where we\nforeclose on\ncollateral, sudden\ndeclines in the value\nor liquidity of the\ncollateral have in the\npast resulted in, and\nmay in the future\nresult in, significant\nlosses to us,\nespecially where there\nis a single type of\ncollateral supporting\nthe obligation. In\naddition, we have been\nand may in the future\nbe subject to claims\nthat the foreclosure\nwas not permitted\nunder the legal\ndocuments, was\nconducted in an\nimproper manner,\nincluding in violation\nof law, or caused a\nclient or counterparty\nto incur significant\nlosses or go out of\nbusiness.\n\nOur market-making\nactivities have been\nand may in the future\nbe affected by changes\nin the levels of\nmarket volatility.\n\nCertain of our market-\nmaking activities\ndepend on market\nvolatility to provide\ntrading and arbitrage\nopportunities to our\nclients, and decreases\nin volatility have\nreduced and may in the\nfuture reduce these\nopportunities and the\nlevel of client\nactivity associated\nwith them and have\nadversely affected and\nmay in the future\nadversely affect the\nresults of these\nactivities. While\nincreased volatility\ncan increase trading\nvolumes and spreads,\nit also increases risk\nas measured by Value-\nat-Risk (VaR) and\nincreases risks in\nconnection with our\nmarket-making\nactivities and can\ncause us to reduce our\ninventory. Limiting\nthe size of our\nmarket-making\npositions can\nadversely affect our\nprofitability. In\nperiods when\nvolatility is\nincreasing, but asset\nvalues are declining\nsignificantly, it may\nnot be possible to\nsell assets at all or\nit may only be\npossible to do so at\nsteep discounts. In\nthose circumstances,\nwe have been and may\nin the future be\nforced to either take\non additional risk or\nto realize losses in\norder to decrease our\nVaR. In addition,\nincreases in\nvolatility increase\nthe level of our RWAs,\nwhich increases the\namount of capital that\nwe are required to\nhold, and this can\nreduce our\nprofitability and\nreduce our ability to\ndistribute capital to\nour shareholders. For\nexample, in August\n2024, market\nvolatility increased\nsignificantly, which\nadversely affected\nactivity levels,\nincreased our market\nRWAs and adversely\nimpacted our results\non some days.\n\nOur investment\nbanking, client\nintermediation, asset\nmanagement and wealth\nmanagement businesses\nhave been adversely\naffected and may in\nthe future be\nadversely affected by\nmarket uncertainty or\nlack of confidence\namong investors and\nCEOs due to declines\nin economic activity\nand other unfavorable\neconomic, geopolitical\nor market conditions.\n\nOur investment banking\nbusiness has been and\nmay in the future be\nadversely affected by\nmarket conditions.\nPoor economic\nconditions and other\nuncertain geopolitical\nconditions may\nadversely affect and\nhave in the past\nadversely affected\ninvestor and CEO\nconfidence, resulting\nin significant\nindustry-wide declines\nin the size and number\nof underwritings and\nof advisory\ntransactions, which\nwould likely have, and\nhave in the past had,\nan adverse effect on\nour revenues and our\nprofit margins. In\nparticular, because a\nsignificant portion of\nour investment banking\nrevenues is derived\nfrom our participation\nin large transactions,\na decline in the\nnumber of large\ntransactions has in\nthe past and would in\nthe future adversely\naffect our investment\nbanking business.\nSimilarly, in recent\nyears, cross-border\ninitial public\nofferings and other\nsecurities offerings\nhave accounted for a\nsignificant proportion\nof new issuance\nactivity. Legislative,\nregulatory or other\nchanges that limit\ntrading in, or the\nissuance of,\nsecurities outside the\nissuers\u2019 domestic\nmarkets, that result\nin or could result in\nthe delisting or\nremoval of securities\nfrom exchanges or\nindices, have in the\npast adversely\naffected and would in\nthe future adversely\naffect our\nunderwriting and\nclient intermediation\nbusinesses.\nFurthermore, changes,\nor proposed changes,\nto international trade\nand investment\npolicies of the U.S.\nand other countries\ncould negatively\naffect market activity\nlevels and our\nrevenues.\n\nIn certain\ncircumstances, market\nuncertainty or general\ndeclines in market or\neconomic activity may\nadversely affect our\nclient intermediation\nbusinesses by\ndecreasing levels of\noverall activity or by\ndecreasing volatility.\n\nMarket uncertainty,\nvolatility and adverse\neconomic conditions,\nas well as declines in\nasset values, may\ncause our clients to\ntransfer their assets\nout of our funds or\nother products or\ntheir brokerage\naccounts and result in\nreduced net revenues,\nprincipally in our\nasset management and\nwealth management\nbusinesses.

This\ncould affect the\nmanagement and\nincentive fees that we\nearn on assets under\nsupervision ( AUS) or\nthe commissions and\nnet spreads that we\nearn for selling other\ninvestment products.\nTo the extent that our\nclients choose to\ninvest in products\nthat we do not\ncurrently offer, we\nwill suffer outflows\nand a loss of\nmanagement fees.\nFurther, if, due to\nchanges in investor\nsentiment or the\nrelative performance\nof certain asset\nclasses or otherwise,\nclients continue to\ninvest in products\nthat generate lower\nfees (e.g., passively\nmanaged or fixed\nincome products), our\naverage effective\nmanagement fee will\ndecline further and\nour asset management\nand wealth management\nbusinesses could be\nadversely affected.\n\nInflation has had, and\ncould continue to\nhave, a negative\neffect on our\nbusiness, results of\noperations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nInflationary pressures\nin recent years have\naffected economies,\nfinancial markets and\nmarket participants\nworldwide.\nInflationary pressures\nin recent years have\nincreased certain of\nour operating\nexpenses, and have\nadversely affected\nconsumer sentiment and\nCEO confidence.\nCentral bank responses\nto inflationary\npressures in recent\nyears have also\nresulted in higher\nmarket interest rates,\nwhich, in turn, have\ncontributed to lower\nactivity levels across\nfinancial markets, in\nparticular for debt\nunderwriting\ntransactions and\nmortgage originations,\nand resulted in lower\nvalues for certain\nfinancial assets which\nhave adversely\naffected our equity\nand debt investments.\nHigher interest rates\nincrease our borrowing\ncosts and have in\nrecent years required\nus to increase\ninterest paid on our\ndeposits. If\ninflationary pressures\nincrease, our expenses\nmay increase; we may\nbe unable to achieve\nour efficiency ratio\ntarget; activity\nlevels for certain of\nour businesses, in\nparticular debt\nunderwriting and\nmortgages, may\ndecline; our interest\nexpense could increase\nfaster than our\ninterest income,\nreducing our net\ninterest income and\nnet interest margin;\ncertain of our\ninvestments could\nincur losses or\ngenerally low levels\nof returns; AUS could\ndecline, or the\ncomposition of our AUS\ncould shift to lower\nfee products, reducing\nmanagement and other\nfees; economies\nworldwide could\nexperience recessions;\nand we could continue\nto operate in a\ngenerally unfavorable\neconomic and market\nenvironment.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nOur liquidity,\nprofitability and\nbusinesses may be\nadversely affected by\nan inability to access\nthe debt capital\nmarkets or to sell\nassets.\n\nLiquidity is essential\nto our businesses. It\nis of critical\nimportance to us, as\nmost of the failures\nof financial\ninstitutions have\noccurred in large part\ndue to insufficient\nliquidity. Our\nliquidity may be\nimpaired by an\ninability to access\nsecured and/or\nunsecured debt\nmarkets, an inability\nto raise or retain\ndeposits, an inability\nto access funds from\nour subsidiaries or\notherwise allocate\nliquidity optimally,\nan inability to sell\nassets or redeem our\ninvestments, lack of\ntimely settlement of\ntransactions, unusual\ndeposit outflows, or\nother unforeseen\noutflows of cash or\ncollateral. This\nsituation may arise\ndue to circumstances\nthat we may be unable\nto control, such as a\ngeneral market or\neconomic disruption or\nan operational problem\nthat affects third\nparties or us, or even\nby the perception\namong market\nparticipants that we,\nor other market\nparticipants, are\nexperiencing greater\nliquidity risk.\n\nWe employ structured\nproducts to benefit\nour clients and hedge\nour own risks. The\nfinancial instruments\nthat we hold and the\ncontracts to which we\nare a party are often\ncomplex, and these\ncomplex structured\nproducts often do not\nhave readily available\nmarkets to access in\ntimes of liquidity\nstress. Our investing\nand financing\nactivities may lead to\nsituations where the\nholdings from these\nactivities represent a\nsignificant portion of\nspecific markets,\nwhich could restrict\nliquidity for our\npositions.\n\nFurther, our ability\nto sell assets may be\nimpaired if there is\nnot generally a liquid\nmarket for such\nassets, as well as in\ncircumstances where\nother market\nparticipants are\nseeking to sell\nsimilar otherwise\ngenerally liquid\nassets at the same\ntime, as is likely to\noccur in a liquidity\nor other market crisis\nor in response to\nchanges to rules or\nregulations. For\nexample, in 2021, an\ninvestment management\nfirm with large\npositions with several\nfinancial institutions\ndefaulted, resulting\nin rapidly declining\nprices in the\nsecurities underlying\nthose positions. In\naddition,\nclearinghouses,\nexchanges and other\nfinancial institutions\nwith which we interact\nmay exercise set-off\nrights or the right to\nrequire additional\ncollateral, including\nin difficult market\nconditions, which\ncould further impair\nour liquidity.\n\nNumerous regulations\nimpose stringent\nliquidity requirements\non large financial\ninstitutions,\nincluding us. These\nregulations require us\nto hold large amounts\nof highly liquid\nassets and reduce our\nflexibility to source\nand deploy funding. In\naddition, our need to\nmanage our operations\nin light of certain\nregulatory\nrequirements when\napplicable thresholds\nare met has in the\npast limited and may\nin the future limit\nour ability to raise\ndeposits in GSIB or\nother funding, which\ncould adversely affect\nour liquidity or\nability to respond\nefficiently to\nliquidity stress.\n                                      \n  36    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We seek to\nfinance many of our\nassets on a secured\nbasis. Any disruptions\nin the credit markets\nmay make it harder and\nmore expensive to\nobtain funding for our\nbusinesses. If our\navailable funding is\nlimited or we are\nforced to fund our\noperations at a higher\ncost, these conditions\nmay require us to\ncurtail our business\nactivities and\nincrease our cost of\nfunding, both of which\ncould reduce our\nprofitability,\nparticularly in our\nbusinesses that\ninvolve investing,\nlending and market\nmaking.\n\nOur clients engaging\nin mergers,\nacquisitions and other\ntypes of strategic\ntransactions often\nrely on access to the\nsecured and unsecured\ncredit markets to\nfinance their\ntransactions.

In\naddition, we extend\nlarge commitments as\npart of our credit\norigination\nactivities.\nDisruptions in the\ncredit markets have in\nthe past substantially\ncurtailed or\neliminated, and may in\nthe future\nsubstantially curtail\nor eliminate, the\ntrading markets for\nloans we originate.\nThese disruptions have\nin the past made, and\nmay in the future\nmake, it difficult for\nus to sell or value\nsuch assets, which\nhave in the past\nresulted, and may in\nthe future result, in\nlosses for us.\n\nRules adopted under\nthe Dodd-Frank Act,\nand similar rules\nadopted in other\njurisdictions, require\nissuers of certain\nasset-backed\nsecurities and any\nperson who organizes\nand initiates certain\nasset-backed\nsecurities\ntransactions to retain\neconomic exposure to\nthe asset, which has\naffected the cost of\nand structures used in\nconnection with these\nsecuritization\nactivities. Our\ninability to reduce\nour credit risk by\nselling, syndicating\nor securitizing these\npositions, including\nduring periods of\nmarket stress, has in\nthe past negatively\naffected and may in\nthe future negatively\naffect our results of\noperations due to a\ndecrease in the fair\nvalue of the\npositions, including\ndue to the insolvency\nor bankruptcy of\nborrowers, as well as\nthe loss of revenues\nassociated with\nselling such\nsecurities or loans.\n\nIn the ordinary course\nof business, we are at\ntimes subject to a\nconcentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular\ncounterparty,\nborrower, issuer\n(including sovereign\nissuers) or geographic\narea or group of\nrelated countries,\nsuch as the E.U., and\na failure or downgrade\nof, or default by,\nsuch entity could\nnegatively impact our\nbusinesses, perhaps\nmaterially, and the\nsystems by which we\nset limits and monitor\nthe level of our\ncredit exposure to\nindividual entities,\nindustries, countries\nand regions may not\nfunction as we have\nanticipated.\nRegulatory reform,\nincluding the Dodd-\nFrank Act, has led to\nincreased\ncentralization of\ntrading activity\nthrough particular\nclearinghouses, agent\nbanks or exchanges,\nwhich has\nsignificantly\nincreased our\nconcentration of risk\nwith respect to these\nentities. While our\nactivities expose us\nto many different\nindustries,\ncounterparties and\ncountries, we\nroutinely execute a\nhigh volume of\ntransactions with\ncounterparties engaged\nin financial services\nactivities, including\nbrokers and dealers,\ncommercial banks,\nclearinghouses,\nexchanges and\ninvestment funds. This\nhas resulted in\nsignificant credit\nconcentration with\nrespect to these\ncounterparties.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    39  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Many of\nthese derivative\ninstruments are\nindividually\nnegotiated and non-\nstandardized, which\ncan make exiting,\ntransferring or\nsettling positions\ndifficult. Many credit\nderivatives require\nthat we deliver to the\ncounterparty the\nunderlying security,\nloan or other\nobligation in order to\nreceive payment. In a\nnumber of cases, we do\nnot hold the\nunderlying security,\nloan or other\nobligation and may not\nbe able to obtain the\nunderlying security,\nloan or other\nobligation. This could\ncause us to forfeit\nthe payments due to us\nunder these contracts\nor result in\nsettlement delays with\nthe attendant credit\nand operational risk,\nas well as increased\ncosts to us.\n\nDerivative\ntransactions also\ninvolve the risk that\ndocumentation has not\nbeen properly\nexecuted, that\nexecuted agreements\nmay not be enforceable\nagainst the\ncounterparty, or that\nobligations under such\nagreements may not be\nable to be \u201cnetted\u201d\nagainst other\nobligations with such\ncounterparty. In\naddition,\ncounterparties may\nclaim that such\ntransactions were not\nappropriate or\nauthorized.\n\nAs a signatory to the\nISDA Universal\nProtocol or U.S. ISDA\nProtocol (ISDA\nProtocols) and being\nsubject to the FRB\u2019s\nand FDIC\u2019s rules on\nQFCs and similar rules\nin other\njurisdictions, we may\nnot be able to\nexercise remedies\nagainst counterparties\nand, as this regime\nhas not yet been\ntested, we may suffer\nrisks or losses that\nwe would not have\nexpected to suffer if\nwe could immediately\nclose out transactions\nupon a termination\nevent. The ISDA\nProtocols and these\nrules and regulations\nextend to repurchase\nagreements and other\ninstruments that are\nnot derivative\ncontracts.\n\nDerivative contracts\nand other\ntransactions,\nincluding secondary\nbank loan purchases\nand sales, entered\ninto with third\nparties are not always\nconfirmed by the\ncounterparties or\nsettled on a timely\nbasis. While the\ntransaction remains\nunconfirmed or during\nany delay in\nsettlement, we are\nsubject to heightened\ncredit and operational\nrisk and in the event\nof a default may find\nit more difficult to\nenforce our rights.\n\nIn addition, as new\ncomplex derivative\nproducts are created,\ncovering a wider array\nof underlying credit\nand other instruments,\ndisputes about the\nterms of the\nunderlying contracts\ncould arise, which\ncould impair our\nability to effectively\nmanage our risk\nexposures from these\nproducts and subject\nus to increased costs.\nThe provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act\nrequiring central\nclearing of credit\nderivatives and other\nOTC derivatives, or a\nmarket shift toward\nstandardized\nderivatives, could\nreduce the risk\nassociated with these\ntransactions, but\nunder certain\ncircumstances could\nalso limit our ability\nto develop derivatives\nthat best suit the\nneeds of our clients\nand to hedge our own\nrisks, and could\nadversely affect our\nprofitability. In\naddition, these\nprovisions have\nincreased our credit\nexposure to central\nclearing platforms.\n                                              \n  Operational                                 \n                                              \nA failure in our or\nthird-party\noperational systems or\nhuman error,\nmalfeasance or other\nmisconduct, could\nimpair our liquidity,\ndisrupt our\nbusinesses, result in\nthe disclosure of\nconfidential\ninformation, damage\nour reputation and\ncause losses.\n\nOur businesses are\nhighly dependent on\nour ability to process\nand monitor, on a\ndaily basis, a very\nlarge number of\ntransactions, many of\nwhich are highly\ncomplex and occur at\nhigh volumes and\nfrequencies, across\nnumerous and diverse\nmarkets in many\ncurrencies. These\ntransactions, as well\nas the information\ntechnology services we\nprovide to clients,\noften must adhere to\nclient-specific\nguidelines, as well as\nlegal and regulatory\nstandards.\n\nMany rules and\nregulations worldwide\ngovern our obligations\nto execute\ntransactions and\nreport transactions\nand other information\nto regulators,\nexchanges and\ninvestors. Compliance\nwith these legal and\nreporting requirements\ncan be challenging,\nand we have been and\nmay in the future be\nsubject to regulatory\nfines and penalties\nfor failing to follow\nthese rules or to\nreport timely,\naccurate and complete\ninformation in\naccordance with these\nrules.\n\nAs the volume, speed,\nfrequency and\ncomplexity of\ntransactions,\nespecially electronic\ntransactions (as well\nas the requirements to\nreport such\ntransactions on a\nreal-time basis to\nclients, regulators\nand exchanges)\nincrease, developing\nand maintaining our\noperational systems\nand infrastructure has\nbecome more\nchallenging, and the\nrisk of systems or\nhuman error by us or\nour third-party\nservice providers in\nconnection with such\ntransactions has\nincreased, as have the\npotential consequences\nof errors due to the\nspeed and volume of\ntransactions involved\nand the potential\ndifficulty associated\nwith discovering\nerrors quickly enough\nto limit the resulting\nconsequences. For\nexample, the\ntransition to a T+1\nsettlement timeframe\nin the U.S. in 2024\nhas subjected us to,\nand will continue to\nsubject us to,\nincreased operational\nrisks with respect to\nreporting and timely\nsettlement of\ntransactions. These\nrisks are exacerbated\nin times of increased\nvolatility.

Enhancements and\nupdates to systems, as\nwell as the requisite\ntraining, including in\nconnection with the\nintegration of new\nbusinesses, entail\nsignificant costs and\ncreate risks\nassociated with\nimplementing new\nsystems and\nintegrating them with\nexisting ones.\n\nThe use of computing\ndevices, phones and\nother mobile devices\nis critical to the\nwork done by our\nemployees and the\noperation of our\nsystems and businesses\nand those of our\nclients and our third-\nparty service\nproviders and vendors.\nTheir importance has\ncontinued to increase,\nfor both our regular\noperations and\nbusiness continuity\nplans. Computers and\ncomputer networks are\nsubject to various\nrisks, including,\namong others, cyber\nattacks, inherent\ntechnological defects,\nsystem disruptions and\nfailures and human\nerror. For example,\nfundamental security\nflaws in computer\nchips found in many\ntypes of these\ncomputing devices and\nphones have been\nreported in the past\nand may occur in the\nfuture, and in July\n2024 there was a\nwidely publicized\ninformation technology\noutage as a result of\na faulty update to a\ncybersecurity software\nproduct that affected\nmany businesses\nworldwide. The use of\npersonal devices by\nour employees or by\nour vendors for work-\nrelated activities\nalso presents risks\nrelated to potential\nviolations of record\nretention and other\nrequirements. Cloud\ntechnologies are also\ncritical to the\noperation of our\nsystems and platforms\nand our reliance on\ncloud technologies is\ngrowing. Service\ndisruptions have\nresulted, and may\nresult in the future,\nin delays in\naccessing, or the loss\nof, data that is\nimportant to our\nbusinesses and may\nhinder our clients\u2019\naccess to our\nplatforms. There have\nbeen a number of\nwidely publicized\ncases of outages in\nconnection with access\nto cloud computing\nproviders. Addressing\nthese and similar\nissues could be costly\nand affect the\nperformance of these\nbusinesses and\nsystems. Applying\nfixes can introduce\noperational risks,\nand, despite the\nfixes, there may still\nbe residual security\nrisks.\n\nNotwithstanding the\nproliferation of\ntechnology and\ntechnology-based risk\nand control systems,\nour businesses\nultimately rely on\npeople as our greatest\nresource, and, from\ntime to time, they\nhave in the past and\nmay in the future make\nmistakes or engage in\nviolations of\napplicable policies,\nlaws, rules or\nprocedures that are\nnot always caught\nimmediately by our\ntechnological\nprocesses or by our\ncontrols and other\nprocedures, which are\nintended to prevent\nand detect such errors\nor violations. These\nhave in the past and\nmay in the future\ninclude calculation\nerrors, mistakes in\naddressing emails,\nerrors in software or\nmodel development or\nimplementation, or\nsimple errors in\njudgment, as well as\nintentional efforts to\nignore or circumvent\napplicable policies,\nlaws, rules or\nprocedures. Human\nerrors, malfeasance\nand other misconduct,\nincluding the\nintentional misuse of\nclient information in\nconnection with\ninsider trading or for\nother purposes, even\nif promptly discovered\nand remediated, has in\nthe past resulted and\nmay in the future\nresult in reputational\ndamage and losses and\nliabilities for us.\n\nThe majority of the\nemployees in our\nprimary locations,\nincluding the New York\nmetropolitan area,\nLondon, Bengaluru,\nHyderabad, Hong Kong,\nTokyo, Salt Lake City,\nDallas, Singapore,\nWarsaw and Birmingham,\nwork in close\nproximity to one\nanother.

There\nhave been a number of\nhighly publicized\ncases involving\nfinancial services\ncompanies, consumer-\nbased companies,\nsoftware and\ninformation technology\nservice providers,\ngovernmental agencies\nand other\norganizations\nreporting the\nunauthorized access or\ndisclosure of client,\ncustomer or other\nconfidential\ninformation in recent\nyears, as well as\ncyber attacks\ninvolving the\ndissemination, theft\nand destruction of\ncorporate information\nor other assets, as a\nresult of inadequate\nprocedures or the\nfailure to follow\nprocedures by\nemployees or\ncontractors or as a\nresult of actions by\nthird parties,\nincluding actions by\nforeign governments.\nThere have also been a\nnumber of highly\npublicized cases where\nhackers have requested\n\u201cransom\u201d payments in\nexchange for not\ndisclosing customer\ninformation or for\nrestoring access to\ninformation or\nsystems.\n\nWe are regularly the\ntarget of attempted\ncyber attacks,\nincluding denial-of-\nservice attacks, and\nmust continuously\nmonitor and develop\nour systems to protect\nthe integrity and\nfunctionality of our\ntechnology\ninfrastructure and\naccess to and the\nsecurity of our data.\nWe have faced a high\nvolume of cyber\nattacks as we expand\nour mobile- and other\ninternet-based\nproducts and services,\nas well as our usage\nof mobile and cloud\ntechnologies, and as\nwe provide these\nservices to individual\nconsumers. Further,\nthe use of AI by\ncybercriminals may\nincrease the frequency\nand severity of\ncybersecurity attacks\nagainst us or our\nthird-party vendors\nand clients.

Cyber\nattacks can originate\nfrom a variety of\nsources, including\nthird parties who are\naffiliated with or\nsponsored by foreign\ngovernments or are\ninvolved with\norganized crime or\nterrorist\norganizations. Third\nparties may also\nattempt to place\nindividuals in our\noffices or induce\nemployees, clients or\nother users of our\nsystems to disclose\nsensitive information\nor provide access to\nour data or that of\nour clients, and these\ntypes of risks may be\ndifficult to detect or\nprevent.\n\nAlthough we take\nprotective measures\nproactively and\nendeavor to modify\nthem as circumstances\nwarrant, our computer\nsystems, software and\nnetworks may be\nvulnerable to\nunauthorized access,\nmisuse, computer\nviruses or other\nmalicious code, cyber\nattacks on our vendors\nand other events that\ncould have a security\nimpact. Risks relating\nto cyber attacks on\nour vendors have been\nincreasing given the\ngreater frequency and\nseverity in recent\nyears of supply chain\nattacks affecting\nsoftware and\ninformation technology\nservice providers. Due\nto the complexity and\ninterconnectedness of\nour systems, the\nprocess of enhancing\nour protective\nmeasures can itself\ncreate a risk of\nsystems disruptions\nand security issues.\nIn addition,\nprotective measures\nthat we employ to\ncompartmentalize our\ndata may reduce our\nvisibility into, and\nadversely affect our\nability to respond to,\ncyber threats and\nissues with our\nsystems.\n\nIf one or more of\nthese types of events\noccur, it potentially\ncould jeopardize our,\nour clients\u2019, our\ncounterparties\u2019 or\nthird parties\u2019\nconfidential and other\ninformation processed,\nstored in, or\ntransmitted through\nour computer systems\nand networks, or\notherwise cause\ninterruptions or\nmalfunctions in our\noperations or those of\nour clients,\ncounterparties or\nthird parties, which\ncould impact their\nability to transact\nwith us or otherwise\nresult in legal or\nregulatory action,\nsignificant losses or\nreputational damage.\nIn addition, such an\nevent could persist\nfor an extended period\nof time before being\nproperly detected or\nescalated, and,\nfollowing detection or\nescalation, it could\ntake considerable time\nfor us to obtain full\nand reliable\ninformation about the\nextent, amount and\ntype of information\ncompromised. During\nthe course of an\ninvestigation, we may\nnot know the full\nimpact of the event\nand how to remediate\nit, and actions,\ndecisions and mistakes\nthat are taken or made\nmay further increase\nthe negative effects\nof the event on our\nbusiness, results of\noperations and\nreputation. Moreover,\nregulations require us\nto disclose\ninformation on a\ntimely basis about\nmaterial cybersecurity\nincidents, including\nthose that may not\nhave been resolved or\nfully investigated at\nthe time of\ndisclosure.\n\nWe have expended, and\nexpect to continue to\nexpend, significant\nresources on an\nongoing basis to\nmodify our protective\nmeasures and to\ninvestigate and\nremediate\nvulnerabilities or\nother exposures, but\nthese measures may be\nineffective and we may\nbe subject to legal or\nregulatory action, as\nwell as financial\nlosses that are either\nnot insured against or\nnot fully covered\nthrough any insurance\nmaintained by us.\nRegulatory agencies\nhave become\nincreasingly focused\non cybersecurity\nincidents.\n\nOur clients\u2019\nconfidential\ninformation may also\nbe at risk from the\ncompromise of clients\u2019\naccounts, including as\na result of a data\nsecurity breach at an\nunrelated company.\nLosses due to\nunauthorized account\nactivity could harm\nour reputation and may\nhave adverse effects\non our business,\nfinancial condition\nand results of\noperations.\n\nThe increased use of\nmobile and cloud\ntechnologies heightens\nthese and other\noperational risks, as\ndo hybrid work\narrangements. Certain\naspects of the\nsecurity of these\ntechnologies are\nunpredictable or\nbeyond our control,\nand the failure by\nmobile technology and\ncloud service\nproviders to\nadequately safeguard\ntheir systems and\nprevent cyber attacks\ncould disrupt our\noperations and result\nin misappropriation,\ncorruption or loss of\nconfidential and other\ninformation. In\naddition, there is a\nrisk that encryption\nand other protective\nmeasures, despite\ntheir sophistication,\nmay be defeated,\nparticularly to the\nextent that new\ncomputing\ntechnologies, such as\nquantum computing,\nvastly increase the\nspeed and computing\npower available.\n\nWe routinely transmit\nand receive personal,\nconfidential and\nproprietary\ninformation by email\nand other electronic\nmeans. We have\ndiscussed and worked\nwith clients, vendors,\nservice providers,\ncounterparties and\nother third parties to\ndevelop secure\ntransmission\ncapabilities and\nprotect against cyber\nattacks, but we do not\nhave, and may be\nunable to put in\nplace, secure\ncapabilities with all\nof our clients,\nvendors, service\nproviders,\ncounterparties and\nother third parties\nand we may not be able\nto ensure that these\nthird parties have\nappropriate controls\nin place to protect\nthe confidentiality of\nthe information.

Our\nrisk management\nprocess seeks to\nbalance our ability to\nprofit from market-\nmaking, investing or\nlending positions, and\nunderwriting\nactivities, with our\nexposure to potential\nlosses. While we\nemploy a broad and\ndiversified set of\nrisk monitoring and\nrisk mitigation\ntechniques, those\ntechniques and the\njudgments that\naccompany their\napplication cannot\nanticipate every\neconomic and financial\noutcome or the\nspecifics and timing\nof such outcomes.\nThus, in the course of\nour activities, we\nhave incurred and may\nin the future incur\nlosses. Market\nconditions in recent\nyears have involved\nunprecedented\ndislocations and\nhighlight the\nlimitations inherent\nin using historical\ndata to manage risk.\n\nThe models that we use\nto assess and control\nour risk exposures\nreflect assumptions\nabout the degrees of\ncorrelation or lack\nthereof among prices\nof various asset\nclasses or other\nmarket indicators. In\ntimes of market stress\nor other unforeseen\ncircumstances,\npreviously\nuncorrelated\nindicators may become\ncorrelated, or\nconversely previously\ncorrelated indicators\nmay move in different\ndirections. These\ntypes of market\nmovements have at\ntimes limited the\neffectiveness of our\nhedging strategies and\nhave caused us to\nincur significant\nlosses, and they may\ndo so in the future.\nThese changes in\ncorrelation have been\nand may in the future\nbe exacerbated where\nother market\nparticipants are using\nrisk or trading models\nwith assumptions or\nalgorithms that are\nsimilar to ours. In\nthese and other cases,\nit may be difficult to\nreduce our risk\npositions due to the\nactivity of other\nmarket participants or\nwidespread market\ndislocations,\nincluding\ncircumstances where\nasset values are\ndeclining\nsignificantly or no\nmarket exists for\ncertain assets.\n\nIn addition, the use\nof models in\nconnection with risk\nmanagement and\nnumerous other\ncritical activities\npresents risks that\nthe models may be\nineffective, either\nbecause of poor\ndesign, ineffective\ntesting, or improper\nor flawed inputs, as\nwell as unpermitted\naccess to the models\nresulting in\nunapproved or\nmalicious changes to\nthe model or its\ninputs.\n\nTo the extent that we\nhave positions through\nour market-making or\norigination activities\nor we make investments\ndirectly through our\ninvesting activities,\nincluding private\nequity or private\ncredit, that do not\nhave an established\nliquid trading market\nor are otherwise\nsubject to\nrestrictions on sale\nor hedging, we may not\nbe able to reduce our\npositions and\ntherefore reduce our\nrisk associated with\nthose positions. In\naddition, to the\nextent permitted by\napplicable law and\nregulation, we invest\nour own capital in\nprivate equity,\ncredit, real estate\nand hedge funds that\nwe manage and\nlimitations on our\nability to withdraw\nsome or all of our\ninvestments in these\nfunds, whether for\nlegal, reputational or\nother reasons, may\nmake it more difficult\nfor us to control the\nrisk exposures\nrelating to these\ninvestments.\n\nPrudent risk\nmanagement, as well as\nregulatory\nrestrictions, may\ncause us to limit our\nexposure to\ncounterparties,\ngeographic areas or\nmarkets, which may\nlimit our business\nopportunities and\nincrease the cost of\nour funding or hedging\nactivities.\n\nOur consumer offerings\npresent us with\ndifferent risks, and\nwe have needed and\ncontinue to need to\nexpand and adapt our\nrisk monitoring and\nmitigation activities\nto account for these\nbusiness activities.

Changes in\ninterpretations,\nwhether in response to\nregulatory guidance,\nindustry conventions,\nour own reassessments\nor otherwise, could\nadversely affect our\nbusinesses, results of\noperations or ability\nto satisfy applicable\nregulatory\nrequirements, such as\ncapital or liquidity\nrequirements.\n\nIf there are new laws\nor regulations or\nchanges in the\ninterpretation or\nenforcement of\nexisting laws or\nregulations applicable\nto our businesses or\nthose of our clients,\nincluding capital,\nliquidity, leverage,\nlong-term debt, total\nloss-absorbing\ncapacity and margin\nrequirements,\nrestrictions on\nleveraged lending or\nother business\npractices, reporting\nrequirements,\nrequirements relating\nto recovery and\nresolution planning,\ntax burdens and\ncompensation\nrestrictions, that are\nimposed on a limited\nsubset of financial\ninstitutions (whether\nbased on size, method\nof funding,\nactivities, geography\nor other criteria),\ncompliance with these\nnew laws or\nregulations, or\nchanges in the\nenforcement of\nexisting laws or\nregulations, could\nadversely affect our\nability to compete\neffectively with other\ninstitutions that are\nnot affected in the\nsame way. In addition,\nregulation imposed on\nfinancial institutions\nor market participants\ngenerally, such as\ntaxes on stock\ntransfers, share\nrepurchases and other\nfinancial\ntransactions, could\nadversely impact\nlevels of market\nactivity more broadly,\nand thus impact our\nbusinesses.

In\naddition, regulators\nand courts continue to\nseek to establish\n\u201cfiduciary\u201d\nobligations to\ncounterparties to\nwhich no such duty had\nbeen thought to exist.\nTo the extent that\nsuch efforts are\nsuccessful, the cost\nof, and liabilities\nassociated with,\nengaging in brokerage,\nclearing, market-\nmaking, prime\nfinancing, investing\nand other similar\nactivities could\nincrease\nsignificantly. To the\nextent that we have\nfiduciary obligations\nin connection with\nacting as a financial\nadviser or investment\nadviser or in other\nroles for individual,\ninstitutional,\nsovereign or\ninvestment fund\nclients, any breach,\nor even an alleged\nbreach, of such\nobligations could have\nmaterially negative\nlegal, regulatory and\nreputational\nconsequences.\n\nFor information about\nthe extensive\nregulation to which\nour businesses are\nsubject, see \u201cBusiness\n\u2014 Regulation\u201d in Part\nI, Item 1 of this Form\n10-K.\n\nA failure to\nappropriately identify\nand address potential\nconflicts of interest\nhas in the past and\nmay in the future\nadversely affect our\nbusinesses.\n\nDue to the broad scope\nof our businesses and\nour client base, we\nregularly address\npotential conflicts of\ninterest, including\nsituations where our\nservices to a\nparticular client or\nour own investments or\nother interests\nconflict, or are\nperceived to conflict,\nwith the interests of\nthat client or another\nclient, as well as\nsituations where one\nor more of our\nbusinesses have access\nto material non-public\ninformation that may\nnot be shared with our\nother businesses and\nsituations where we\nmay be a creditor of\nan entity with which\nwe also have an\nadvisory or other\nrelationship.\n\nIn addition, our\nstatus as a BHC\nsubjects us to\nheightened regulation\nand increased\nregulatory scrutiny by\nthe FRB with respect\nto transactions\nbetween GS Bank USA\nand its subsidiaries\nand entities that are\nor could be viewed as\naffiliates of ours\nand, under the Volcker\nRule, transactions\nbetween us and covered\nfunds.\n\nWe have extensive\nprocedures and\ncontrols that are\ndesigned to identify\nand address conflicts\nof interest, including\nthose designed to\nprevent the improper\nsharing of information\namong our businesses.\nHowever, appropriately\nidentifying and\ndealing with conflicts\nof interest is complex\nand difficult, and our\nreputation, which is\none of our most\nimportant assets,\ncould be damaged and\nthe willingness of\nclients to enter into\ntransactions with us\nmay be adversely\naffected if we fail,\nor appear to fail, to\nidentify, disclose and\ndeal appropriately\nwith conflicts of\ninterest. In addition,\npotential or perceived\nconflicts have in the\npast and may in the\nfuture give rise to\nlitigation, government\ninvestigations or\nenforcement actions.\nAdditionally, our One\nGoldman Sachs\ninitiative, as well as\nthe alignment of our\nbusinesses, aim to\nincrease collaboration\namong our businesses,\nwhich may increase the\npotential for actual\nor perceived conflicts\nof interest and\nimproper information\nsharing.\n                                      \n  48    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe may be adversely\naffected by increased\ngovernmental and\nregulatory scrutiny or\nnegative publicity.\n\nGovernmental scrutiny\nfrom regulators,\nlegislative bodies and\nlaw enforcement\nagencies with respect\nto matters relating to\ncompensation, our\nbusiness practices,\nour past actions and\nother matters remains\nat high levels.\nPolitical and public\nsentiment regarding\nfinancial institutions\nhas in the past\nresulted and may in\nthe future result in a\nsignificant amount of\nadverse press\ncoverage, as well as\nadverse statements or\ncharges by regulators\nor other government\nofficials. Press\ncoverage and other\npublic statements that\nassert some form of\nwrongdoing (including,\nin some cases, press\ncoverage and public\nstatements that do not\ndirectly involve us)\noften result in some\ntype of investigation\nby regulators,\nlegislators and law\nenforcement officials\nor in lawsuits.\n\nResponding to these\ninvestigations and\nlawsuits, regardless\nof the ultimate\noutcome of the\nproceeding, is time-\nconsuming and\nexpensive and can\ndivert the time and\neffort of our senior\nmanagement from our\nbusiness. Penalties\nand fines sought by\nregulatory authorities\nhave increased\nsubstantially and\ncertain regulators\nhave been more likely\nin recent years to\ncommence enforcement\nactions or to support\nlegislation targeted\nat the financial\nservices industry.\nGovernmental\nauthorities may also\nbe more likely to\npursue criminal or\nother actions,\nincluding seeking\nadmissions of\nwrongdoing or guilty\npleas, in connection\nwith the resolution of\nan inquiry or\ninvestigation to the\nextent a company is\nviewed as having\npreviously engaged in\ncriminal, regulatory\nor other misconduct.\nAdverse publicity,\ngovernmental scrutiny\nand legal and\nenforcement\nproceedings can also\nhave a negative impact\non our reputation and\non the morale and\nperformance of our\nemployees, which could\nadversely affect our\nbusinesses and results\nof operations.\nFurther, we are\nsubject to regulatory\nsettlements, orders\nand feedback that\nrequire significant\nremediation activities\nand enhancements to\nexisting controls,\nsystems and\nprocedures, which has\nrequired and will\nrequire us to commit\nsignificant resources,\nincluding hiring, as\nwell as testing the\noperation and\neffectiveness of new\ncontrols, policies and\nprocedures. The\nfailure to complete\nthese remediation\nactivities in a timely\nmanner could lead to\nhigher operating\nexpenses, reputational\ndamage and other\nnegative consequences.\n\nThe financial services\nindustry generally and\nour businesses in\nparticular have been\nsubject to negative\npublicity. Our\nreputation and\nbusinesses may be\nadversely affected by\nnegative publicity or\ninformation regarding\nour businesses,\npersonnel, corporate\nengagement programs\nand other initiatives,\nwhether or not\naccurate or true, that\nmay be posted on\nsocial media or other\ninternet forums or\npublished by news\norganizations.\nPostings on these\ntypes of forums may\nalso adversely impact\nrisk positions of our\nclients and other\nparties that owe us\nmoney, securities or\nother assets and\nincrease the chance\nthat they will not\nperform their\nobligations to us or\nreduce the revenues we\nreceive from their use\nof our services. The\nspeed and\npervasiveness with\nwhich information can\nbe disseminated\nthrough these\nchannels, in\nparticular social\nmedia, may magnify\nrisks relating to\nnegative publicity.\n\nIn 2023, the rapid\ndissemination of\nnegative information\nthrough social media,\nin part, is believed\nto have led to the\ncollapse of Silicon\nValley Bank (SVB). SVB\nsuffered a level of\ndeposit withdrawals\nwithin a time period\nnot previously\nexperienced by a\nfinancial institution.\nWe could also be\nsubject to rapid\ndeposit withdrawals or\nother outflows as a\nresult of negative\nsocial media posts or\nother negative\npublicity.\n\nSubstantial civil or\ncriminal liability or\nsignificant regulatory\naction against us has\nin the past had and\nmay in the future have\nmaterial adverse\nfinancial effects and\nsignificant\nreputational\nconsequences, which in\nturn could seriously\nharm our business\nprospects.\n\nWe face significant\nlegal risks in our\nbusinesses, and the\nvolume of claims and\namount of damages and\npenalties claimed in\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nagainst financial\ninstitutions remain\nhigh. See Notes 18 and\n27 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements\nin Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Form 10-K for\ninformation about\ncertain of our legal\nand regulatory\nproceedings and\ninvestigations. We\nhave seen legal claims\nby consumers and\nclients increase in a\nmarket downturn and\nemployment-related\nclaims increase\nfollowing periods in\nwhich we have reduced\nour headcount.\nAdditionally,\ngovernmental entities\nhave been plaintiffs\nand are parties in\ncertain of our legal\nproceedings, and we\nmay face future civil\nor criminal actions or\nclaims by the same or\nother governmental\nentities, as well as\nfollow-on civil\nlitigation that is\noften commenced after\nregulatory\nsettlements.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    49  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSignificant\nsettlements by large\nfinancial\ninstitutions,\nincluding, in some\ncases, us, with\ngovernmental entities\nhave become common.\nThe trend of large\nsettlements with\ngovernmental entities\nmay adversely affect\nthe outcomes for other\nfinancial\ninstitutions,\nincluding, in some\ncases, us, in similar\nactions, especially\nwhere governmental\nofficials have\nannounced that the\nlarge settlements will\nbe used as the basis\nor a template for\nother settlements. The\nuncertain regulatory\nenforcement\nenvironment makes it\ndifficult to estimate\nprobable losses, which\ncan lead to\nsubstantial\ndisparities between\nlegal reserves and\nsubsequent actual\nsettlements or\npenalties.\n\nClaims of collusion or\nanti-competitive\nconduct have become\nmore common. Financial\ninstitutions\n(including us) have\nbeen subject to civil\ncases and\ninvestigatory demands\nrelating to alleged\nbid-rigging, group\nboycotts or other\nanti-competitive\npractices. Antitrust\nlaws generally provide\nfor joint and several\nliability and treble\ndamages. These claims\nhave resulted in\nsignificant\nsettlements and fines\nfor us in the past and\nmay do so in the\nfuture.\n\nWe are subject to laws\nand regulations\nworldwide, including\nthe FCPA and the U.K.\nBribery Act, relating\nto corrupt and illegal\npayments to, and\nhiring practices with\nregard to, government\nofficials and others.\nViolation of these or\nsimilar laws and\nregulations have in\nthe past resulted in\nand could in the\nfuture result in\nsignificant monetary\npenalties. Such\nviolations could also\nresult in severe\nrestrictions on our\nactivities and damage\nto our reputation.\n\nCertain law\nenforcement\nauthorities have\nrecently required\nadmissions of\nwrongdoing, and, in\nsome cases, criminal\npleas, as part of the\nresolutions of matters\nbrought against\nfinancial institutions\nor their employees.\nSee for example,\n\u201c1MDB-Related Matters\u201d\nin Note 27 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Form\n10-K. Any such\nresolution of a\ncriminal matter\ninvolving us or our\nemployees could lead\nto increased exposure\nto civil litigation,\ncould adversely affect\nour reputation, could\nresult in penalties or\nlimitations on our\nability to conduct our\nactivities generally\nor in certain\ncircumstances and\ncould have other\nnegative effects.\nFurther, as a result\nof this type of\nsettlement, we are no\nlonger a \u201cwell-known\nseasoned issuer,\u201d\nwhich places\nlimitations on the\nmanner in which we can\nmarket our securities.\n\nIn conducting our\nbusinesses around the\nworld, we are subject\nto political, legal,\nregulatory, tax and\nother risks that are\ninherent in operating\nin many countries.\n\nIn conducting our\nbusinesses and\nsupporting our global\noperations, we are\nsubject to risks of\npossible\nnationalization,\nexpropriation, price\ncontrols, capital\ncontrols, exchange\ncontrols,\ncommunications and\nother content\nrestrictions, and\nother restrictive\ngovernmental actions.\nFor example, sanctions\nhave been imposed by\nthe U.S. and the E.U.\non certain individuals\nand companies in\nRussia and Venezuela.\nIn many countries, the\nlaws and regulations\napplicable to the\nsecurities and\nfinancial services\nindustries and many of\nthe transactions in\nwhich we are involved\nare uncertain and\nevolving, and it may\nbe difficult for us to\ndetermine the exact\nrequirements of local\nlaws in every market.\nWe have been, in some\ncases, subject to\ndivergent and\nconflicting laws and\nregulations across\nmarkets, and we are\nincreasingly subject\nto the risk that the\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate have\nimplemented or may\nimplement laws and\nregulations that\ndirectly conflict with\nthose of another\njurisdiction. Any\ndetermination by local\nregulators that we\nhave not acted in\ncompliance with the\napplication of local\nlaws in a particular\nmarket or our failure\nto develop effective\nworking relationships\nwith local regulators\ncould have a\nsignificant and\nnegative effect not\nonly on our businesses\nin that market, but\nalso on our reputation\ngenerally. Further, in\nsome jurisdictions a\nfailure, or alleged\nfailure, to comply\nwith laws and\nregulations has\nsubjected and may in\nthe future subject us\nand our personnel not\nonly to civil actions,\nbut also criminal\nactions and other\nsanctions. We are also\nsubject to the\nenhanced risk that\ntransactions we\nstructure might not be\nlegally enforceable in\nall cases.\n\nWhile business and\nother practices\nthroughout the world\ndiffer, our principal\nentities are subject\nin their operations\nworldwide to rules and\nregulations relating\nto corrupt and illegal\npayments, hiring\npractices and money\nlaundering, as well as\nlaws relating to doing\nbusiness with certain\nindividuals, groups\nand countries, such as\nthe FCPA, the BSA and\nthe U.K. Bribery Act.\nWhile we have invested\nand continue to invest\nsignificant resources\nin training and in\ncompliance monitoring,\nthe geographical\ndiversity of our\noperations, employees,\nclients and consumers,\nas well as the vendors\nand other third\nparties that we deal\nwith, greatly\nincreases the risk\nthat we may be found\nin violation of such\nrules or regulations\nand such violations\nhave in the past and\ncould in the future\nsubject us to\nsignificant penalties\nor adversely affect\nour reputation. See\nfor example, \u201c1MDB-\nRelated Matters\u201d in\nNote 27 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Form\n10-K.\n                                      \n  50    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, there\nhave been a number of\nhighly publicized\ncases around the\nworld, involving\nactual or alleged\nfraud or other\nmisconduct by\nemployees in the\nfinancial services\nindustry, and we have\nhad and may in the\nfuture have employee\nmisconduct. This\nmisconduct has\nincluded and may also\nin the future include\nintentional efforts to\nignore or circumvent\napplicable policies,\nrules or procedures or\nmisappropriation of\nfunds and the theft of\nproprietary\ninformation, including\nproprietary software.\nIt is not always\npossible to deter or\nprevent employee\nmisconduct and the\nprecautions we take to\nprevent and detect\nthis activity have not\nbeen and may not be\neffective in all\ncases, as reflected by\nthe settlements\nrelating to 1MDB.\n\nThe application of\nregulatory strategies\nand requirements in\nthe U.S. and in\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions\nto facilitate the\norderly resolution of\nlarge financial\ninstitutions could\ncreate greater risk of\nloss for Group Inc.\u2019s\nsecurity holders.\n\nAs described in\n\u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\n\u2014 Banking Supervision\nand Regulation \u2014\nInsolvency of an IDI\nor a BHC,\u201d if the FDIC\nis appointed as\nreceiver under OLA,\nthe rights of Group\nInc.\u2019s creditors would\nbe determined under\nOLA, and substantial\ndifferences exist in\nthe rights of\ncreditors between OLA\nand the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code,\nincluding the right of\nthe FDIC under OLA to\ndisregard the strict\npriority of creditor\nclaims in some\ncircumstances, which\ncould have a material\nadverse effect on our\ndebtholders.\n\nThe FDIC has announced\nthat a single point of\nentry strategy may be\na desirable strategy\nunder OLA to resolve a\nlarge financial\ninstitution in a\nmanner that would,\namong other things,\nimpose losses on\nshareholders,\ndebtholders and other\ncreditors of the top-\ntier BHC (in our case,\nGroup Inc.), while the\nBHC\u2019s subsidiaries may\ncontinue to operate.\nIt is possible that\nthe application of the\nsingle point of entry\nstrategy under OLA, in\nwhich Group Inc. would\nbe the only entity to\nenter resolution\nproceedings (and its\nmaterial broker-\ndealer, bank and other\noperating entities\nwould not enter\nresolution\nproceedings), would\nresult in greater\nlosses to Group Inc.\u2019s\nsecurity holders\n(including holders of\nour fixed rate,\nfloating rate and\nindexed debt\nsecurities), than the\nlosses that would\nresult from the\napplication of a\nbankruptcy proceeding\nor a different\nresolution strategy,\nsuch as a multiple\npoint of entry\nresolution strategy\nfor Group Inc. and\ncertain of its\nmaterial subsidiaries.\n\nAssuming Group Inc.\nentered resolution\nproceedings and\nsupport from Group\nInc. or other\nresources available to\nits subsidiaries was\nsufficient to enable\nthe subsidiaries to\nremain solvent, losses\nat the subsidiary\nlevel would be\ntransferred to Group\nInc. and ultimately\nborne by Group Inc.\u2019s\nsecurity holders,\nthird-party creditors\nof Group Inc.\u2019s\nsubsidiaries would\nreceive full\nrecoveries on their\nclaims, and Group\nInc.\u2019s security\nholders (including our\nshareholders,\ndebtholders and other\nunsecured creditors)\ncould face significant\nand possibly complete\nlosses. In that case,\nGroup Inc.\u2019s security\nholders would face\nlosses while the\nthird-party creditors\nof Group Inc.\u2019s\nsubsidiaries would\nincur no losses\nbecause the\nsubsidiaries would\ncontinue to operate\nand would not enter\nresolution or\nbankruptcy\nproceedings. In\naddition, holders of\nGroup Inc.\u2019s eligible\nlong-term debt and\nholders of Group\nInc.\u2019s other debt\nsecurities could face\nlosses ahead of its\nother similarly\nsituated creditors in\na resolution under OLA\nif the FDIC exercised\nits right, described\nabove, to disregard\nthe priority of\ncreditor claims.\n\nOLA also provides the\nFDIC with authority to\ncause creditors and\nshareholders of the\nfinancial company in\nreceivership to bear\nlosses before\ntaxpayers are exposed\nto such losses, and\namounts owed to the\nU.S. government would\ngenerally receive a\nstatutory payment\npriority over the\nclaims of private\ncreditors, including\nsenior creditors.\n\nIn addition, under\nOLA, claims of\ncreditors (including\ndebtholders) could be\nsatisfied through the\nissuance of equity or\nother securities in a\nbridge entity to which\nGroup Inc.\u2019s assets\nare transferred. If\nsuch a securities-for-\nclaims exchange were\nimplemented, there can\nbe no assurance that\nthe value of the\nsecurities of the\nbridge entity would be\nsufficient to repay or\nsatisfy all or any\npart of the creditor\nclaims for which the\nsecurities were\nexchanged. While the\nFDIC has issued\nregulations to\nimplement OLA, not all\naspects of how the\nFDIC might exercise\nthis authority are\nknown and additional\nrulemaking is\npossible.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    51  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, certain\njurisdictions,\nincluding the U.K. and\nthe E.U., have\nimplemented resolution\nregimes to provide\nresolution authorities\nwith the ability to\nrecapitalize a failing\nentity by writing down\nits unsecured debt or\nconverting its\nunsecured debt into\nequity. Such \u201cbail-in\u201d\npowers are intended to\nenable the\nrecapitalization of a\nfailing institution by\nallocating losses to\nits shareholders and\nunsecured debtholders.\nFor example, the Bank\nof England requires a\ncertain amount of\nintercompany funding\nthat we provide to our\nmaterial U.K.\nsubsidiaries to\ncontain a contractual\ntrigger to expressly\npermit the Bank of\nEngland to exercise\nsuch \u201cbail-in\u201d powers\nin certain\ncircumstances. If the\nintercompany funding\nwe provide to our\nsubsidiaries is\n\u201cbailed in,\u201d Group\nInc.\u2019s claims on its\nsubsidiaries would be\nsubordinated to the\nclaims of the\nsubsidiaries\u2019 third-\nparty creditors or\nwritten down. U.S.\nregulators are\nconsidering and\nnon-U.S. authorities\nhave adopted\nrequirements that\ncertain subsidiaries\nof large financial\ninstitutions maintain\nminimum amounts of\ntotal loss-absorbing\ncapacity that would\npass losses up from\nthe subsidiaries to\nthe top-tier BHC and,\nultimately, to\nsecurity holders of\nthe top-tier BHC in\nthe event of failure.\n\nThe application of\nGroup Inc.\u2019s proposed\nresolution strategy\ncould result in\ngreater losses for\nGroup Inc.\u2019s security\nholders.\n\nIn our resolution\nplan, Group Inc. would\nbe resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nThe strategy described\nin our resolution plan\nis a variant of the\nsingle point of entry\nstrategy: Group Inc.\nand Goldman Sachs\nFunding LLC (Funding\nIHC), a wholly-owned,\ndirect subsidiary of\nGroup Inc., would\nrecapitalize and\nprovide liquidity to\ncertain major\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding through the\nforgiveness of\nintercompany\nindebtedness, the\nextension of the\nmaturities of\nintercompany\nindebtedness and the\nextension of\nadditional\nintercompany loans. If\nthis strategy were\nsuccessful, creditors\nof some or all of\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nsubsidiaries would\nreceive full\nrecoveries on their\nclaims, while Group\nInc.\u2019s security\nholders could face\nsignificant and\npossibly complete\nlosses.\n\nTo facilitate the\nexecution of our\nresolution plan, we\nformed Funding IHC. In\nexchange for an\nunsecured subordinated\nfunding note and\nequity interest, Group\nInc. transferred\ncertain intercompany\nreceivables and\nsubstantially all of\nits GCLA to Funding\nIHC, and agreed to\ntransfer additional\nGCLA above prescribed\nthresholds.\n\nWe also put in place a\nCapital and Liquidity\nSupport Agreement\n(CLSA) among Group\nInc., Funding IHC and\nour major\nsubsidiaries. Under\nthe CLSA, Funding IHC\nhas provided Group\nInc. with a committed\nline of credit that\nallows Group Inc. to\ndraw sufficient funds\nto meet its cash needs\nduring the ordinary\ncourse of business. In\naddition, if our\nfinancial resources\ndeteriorate so\nseverely that\nresolution may be\nimminent, (i) the\ncommitted line of\ncredit will\nautomatically\nterminate and the\nunsecured subordinated\nfunding note will\nautomatically be\nforgiven, (ii) all\nintercompany\nreceivables owed by\nthe major subsidiaries\nto Group Inc. will be\ntransferred to Funding\nIHC or their\nmaturities will be\nextended to five\nyears, (iii) Group\nInc. will be obligated\nto transfer\nsubstantially all of\nits remaining\nintercompany\nreceivables and GCLA\n(other than an amount\nto fund anticipated\nbankruptcy expenses)\nto Funding IHC, and\n(iv) Funding IHC will\nbe obligated to\nprovide capital and\nliquidity support to\nthe major\nsubsidiaries. Group\nInc.\u2019s and Funding\nIHC\u2019s obligations\nunder the CLSA are\nsecured pursuant to a\nrelated security\nagreement. Such\nactions would\nmaterially and\nadversely affect Group\nInc.\u2019s liquidity. As a\nresult, during a\nperiod of severe\nstress, Group Inc.\nmight commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nat an earlier time\nthan it otherwise\nwould if the CLSA and\nrelated security\nagreement had not been\nimplemented.\n\nIf Group Inc.\u2019s\nproposed resolution\nstrategy were\nsuccessful, Group\nInc.\u2019s security\nholders could face\nlosses while the\nthird-party creditors\nof Group Inc.\u2019s major\nsubsidiaries would\nincur no losses\nbecause those\nsubsidiaries would\ncontinue to operate\nand not enter\nresolution or\nbankruptcy\nproceedings. As part\nof the strategy, Group\nInc. could also seek\nto elevate the\npriority of its\nguarantee obligations\nrelating to its major\nsubsidiaries\u2019\nderivative contracts\nor transfer them to\nanother entity so that\ncross-default and\nearly termination\nrights would be stayed\nunder the ISDA\nProtocols, as\napplicable, which\nwould result in\nholders of Group\nInc.\u2019s eligible long-\nterm debt and holders\nof Group Inc.\u2019s other\ndebt securities\nincurring losses ahead\nof the beneficiaries\nof those guarantee\nobligations. It is\nalso possible that\nholders of Group\nInc.\u2019s eligible long-\nterm debt and other\ndebt securities could\nincur losses ahead of\nother similarly\nsituated creditors of\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nsubsidiaries.\n\nIf Group Inc.\u2019s\nproposed resolution\nstrategy were not\nsuccessful, Group\nInc.\u2019s financial\ncondition would be\nadversely impacted and\nGroup Inc.\u2019s security\nholders, including\ndebtholders, may as a\nconsequence be in a\nworse position than if\nthe strategy had not\nbeen implemented.

We compete\non the basis of a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding transaction\nexecution, our\nproducts and services,\ninnovation,\nreputation,\ncreditworthiness and\nprice. There has been\nsubstantial\nconsolidation and\nconvergence among\ncompanies in the\nfinancial services\nindustry. This has\nhastened the\nglobalization of the\nsecurities and other\nfinancial services\nmarkets. As a result,\nwe have had to commit\ncapital to support our\ninternational\noperations and to\nexecute large global\ntransactions. As we\nhave expanded into new\nbusiness areas and new\ngeographic regions, we\nhave faced competitors\nwith more experience\nand more established\nrelationships with\nclients, regulators\nand industry\nparticipants in the\nrelevant market, which\ncould adversely affect\nour ability to expand\nour businesses.\n\nGovernments and\nregulators have\nadopted regulations,\nimposed taxes, adopted\ncompensation\nrestrictions or\notherwise put forward\nvarious proposals that\nhave impacted or may\nimpact our ability to\nconduct certain of our\nbusinesses in a cost-\neffective manner or at\nall in certain or all\njurisdictions,\nincluding proposals\nrelating to\nrestrictions on the\ntype of activities in\nwhich financial\ninstitutions are\npermitted to engage.\nThese or other similar\nrules, many of which\ndo not apply to all\nour U.S. or non-U.S.\ncompetitors, could\nimpact our ability to\ncompete effectively.\n\nPricing and other\ncompetitive pressures\nin our businesses have\ncontinued to increase,\nparticularly in\nsituations where some\nof our competitors may\nseek to increase\nmarket share by\nreducing prices. For\nexample, in connection\nwith investment\nbanking and other\nassignments, in\nresponse to\ncompetitive pressure\nwe have experienced,\nwe have extended and\npriced credit at\nlevels that, in some\ncases, have not fully\ncompensated us for the\nrisks we undertook.\n\nThe financial services\nindustry is highly\ninterrelated in that a\nsignificant volume of\ntransactions occur\namong a limited number\nof members of that\nindustry. Many\ntransactions are\nsyndicated to other\nfinancial\ninstitutions, and\nfinancial institutions\nare often\ncounterparties in\ntransactions. This has\nled to claims by other\nmarket participants\nand regulators that\nsuch institutions have\ncolluded in order to\nmanipulate markets or\nmarket prices,\nincluding allegations\nthat antitrust laws\nhave been violated.\nWhile we have\nextensive procedures\nand controls that are\ndesigned to identify\nand prevent such\nactivities, they may\nnot be effective.\nAllegations of such\nactivities,\nparticularly by\nregulators, can have a\nnegative reputational\nimpact and can subject\nus to large fines and\nsettlements, and\npotentially\nsignificant penalties,\nincluding treble\ndamages.\n\nThe growth of\nelectronic trading and\nthe introduction of\nnew products and\ntechnologies,\nincluding trading and\ndistributed ledger\ntechnologies, such as\ncryptocurrencies, and\nAI technologies, has\nincreased competition.\n\nTechnology is\nfundamental to our\nbusiness and our\nindustry.

Some of\nthese alternative\ntrading systems\ncompete with us,\nparticularly our\nexchange-based market-\nmaking activities, and\nwe may experience\ncontinued competitive\npressures in these and\nother areas. In\naddition, the\nincreased use by our\nclients of low-cost\nelectronic trading\nsystems and direct\nelectronic access to\ntrading markets has\ncaused and could\ncontinue to cause a\nreduction in\ncommissions and\nspreads. As our\nclients increasingly\nuse our systems to\ntrade directly in the\nmarkets, we may incur\nliabilities as a\nresult of their use of\nour order routing and\nexecution\ninfrastructure.\n\nWe have invested\nsignificant resources\ninto the development\nof electronic trading\nsystems and expect to\ncontinue to do so, but\nthere is no assurance\nthat the revenues\ngenerated by these\nsystems will yield an\nadequate return,\nparticularly given the\ngenerally lower\ncommissions arising\nfrom electronic\ntrades.\n                                      \n  54    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The adoption\nand evolution of such\nnew technologies may\nalso increase our\ncompliance and\nregulatory costs.\nFurther, technologies,\nsuch as those based on\ndistributed ledgers,\nthat do not require\nintermediation could\nalso significantly\ndisrupt payments\nprocessing and other\nfinancial services.\nRegulatory limitations\non our involvement in\nproducts and platforms\ninvolving digital\nassets and distributed\nledger technologies\nmay not apply equally\nor, in some cases, at\nall to certain of our\ncompetitors.

Any of the\nforegoing could\nadversely affect our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition, liquidity\nand results of\noperations, possibly\nmaterially.\n\nWe face enhanced risks\nas we operate in new\nlocations and transact\nwith a broader array\nof clients and\ncounterparties.\n\nOur businesses, have\nin the past, and may\nin the future, bring\nus into contact,\ndirectly or\nindirectly, with\nindividuals and\nentities that are not\nwithin our traditional\nclient and\ncounterparty base,\nexpose us to new asset\nclasses and new\nmarkets, and present\nus with integration\nchallenges. For\nexample, we continue\nto transact business\nand invest in new\nregions, including a\nwide range of emerging\nand growth markets,\nand we expect this\ntrend to continue.\nVarious emerging and\ngrowth market\ncountries have\nexperienced severe\neconomic and financial\ndisruptions, including\nsignificant\ndevaluations of their\ncurrencies, defaults\nor threatened defaults\non sovereign debt,\ncapital and currency\nexchange controls, and\nlow or negative growth\nrates in their\neconomies. The\npossible effects of\nany of these\nconditions include an\nadverse impact on our\nbusinesses and\nincreased volatility\nin financial markets\ngenerally.\n\nIn our consumer-\noriented activities,\nwe have faced and\ncontinue to face\ncompliance, legal and\nregulatory risk,\nincreased reputational\nrisk and increased\noperational risk due\nto, among other\nthings, higher\ntransaction volumes\nand significantly\nincreased retention\nand transmission of\nconsumer and client\ninformation. We are\nalso subject to\nadditional legal\nrequirements,\nincluding with respect\nto suitability and\nconsumer protection\n(for example,\nRegulation Best\nInterest, fair lending\nlaws and regulations\nand privacy laws and\nregulations). Further,\nidentity fraud may\nincrease and credit\nreporting practices\nmay change in a manner\nthat makes it more\ndifficult for\nfinancial\ninstitutions, such as\nus, to evaluate the\ncreditworthiness of\nconsumers.\n\nIn connection with our\ntransaction banking\nactivities, we face\ncompliance, legal and\nregulatory risk,\nincluding with respect\nto know-your-customer,\nanti-money laundering\nand reporting\nrequirements and\nprohibitions on\ntransfers of property\nbelonging to\ncountries, entities\nand individuals\nsubject to sanctions\nby U.S. or other\ngovernmental\nauthorities. We are\nmaking significant\nenhancements to\nexisting controls,\nsystems and procedures\nto manage these risks.\n                                      \n  58    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNew business\ninitiatives expose us\nto new and enhanced\nrisks, including risks\nassociated with\ndealing with\ngovernmental entities,\nreputational concerns\narising from dealing\nwith different types\nof clients, business\npartners,\ncounterparties and\ninvestors, greater\nregulatory scrutiny of\nthese activities,\nincreased credit-\nrelated, market,\nsovereign and\noperational risks,\nrisks arising from\naccidents or acts of\nterrorism, and\nreputational concerns\nwith the manner in\nwhich certain assets\nare being operated or\nheld or in which we\ninteract with these\nclients, business\npartners,\ncounterparties and\ninvestors. Legal,\nregulatory and\nreputational risks may\nalso exist in\nconnection with\nactivities and\ntransactions involving\nnew products or\nmarkets where there is\nregulatory uncertainty\nor where there are\ndifferent or\nconflicting\nregulations depending\non the regulator or\nthe jurisdiction\ninvolved, particularly\nwhere transactions in\nsuch products may\ninvolve multiple\njurisdictions.\n\nWe have developed and\npursued new business\nand strategic\ninitiatives, including\nacquisitions, and may\ncontinue to do so. If\nand to the extent we\nare unable to\nsuccessfully execute\nthose initiatives, we\nmay incur\nunanticipated costs\nand losses, and face\nother adverse\nconsequences, such as\nnegative reputational\neffects. In addition,\nthe actual effects of\npursuing those\ninitiatives may\ndiffer, possibly\nmaterially, from the\nbenefits that we\nexpect to realize from\nthem, such as\ngenerating additional\nrevenues, achieving\nexpense savings,\nreducing operational\nrisk exposures or\nusing capital and\nfunding more\nefficiently. Engaging\nin new activities\nexposes us to a\nvariety of risks,\nincluding that we may\nbe unable to\nsuccessfully develop\nnew, competitive,\nefficient and\neffective systems and\nprocesses, and hire\nand retain the\nnecessary personnel.\nDue to our lack of\nhistorical experience\nwith unsecured\nconsumer lending, our\nloan loss assumptions\nmay prove to be\nincorrect and we may\nincur losses\nsignificantly above\nthose which we\noriginally anticipated\nin entering the\nbusiness.\n\nIn recent years, we\nhave invested, and may\ncontinue to invest,\nmore in businesses\nthat we expect will\ngenerate a higher\nlevel of more\nconsistent revenues.\nSuch investments and\nacquisitions may not\nbe successful or have\nreturns similar to our\nother businesses.\n\nWe may not be able to\nfully realize the\nexpected benefits or\nsynergies from\nacquisitions or other\nbusiness initiatives\nin the time frames we\nexpect, or at all.\n\nWe have engaged in\nselective acquisitions\nand may continue to do\nso in the future and\nthese acquisitions\nmay, individually or\nin the aggregate, be\nmaterial to us. Any\nfuture acquisitions\ncould involve the\nissuance of common\nstock and/or the\npayment of cash as\nconsideration. The\nsuccess of our\nacquisitions will\ndepend, in part, on\nour ability to\nintegrate the acquired\nbusinesses and realize\nanticipated synergies,\ncost savings and\ngrowth opportunities.\nFor example, in 2024,\nwe sold GreenSky\nHoldings, LLC, which\nwe had previously\nacquired, and in\nconnection with the\ndisposition we\nincurred a write-down\nof intangible assets\nand goodwill. Also in\n2024, we entered into\nan agreement to\ntransition the GM\ncredit card program to\nanother issuer and\nhave incurred a write-\ndown of intangible\nassets in connection\nwith that transaction.\nIn any future\nacquisitions, we may\nface numerous risks\nand uncertainties in\ncombining and\nintegrating the\nrelevant businesses\nand systems, including\nthe need to combine or\nseparate accounting\nand data processing\nsystems and management\ncontrols and to\nintegrate\nrelationships with\nclients,\ncounterparties,\nregulators and others\nin connection with\nacquisitions.\nIntegration of\nacquired businesses is\ntime-consuming and\ncould disrupt our\nongoing businesses,\nproduce unforeseen\nregulatory or\noperating\ndifficulties, cause us\nto incur incremental\nexpenses or require\nincremental financial,\nmanagement and other\nresources. It is also\npossible that an\nacquisition, once\nannounced, may not\nclose due to the\nfailure to satisfy\napplicable closing\nconditions, such as\nthe receipt of\nnecessary shareholder\nor regulatory\napprovals.\n\nThere is no assurance\nthat any of our\nacquisitions will be\nsuccessfully\nintegrated or yield\nall of the expected\nbenefits and synergies\nin the time frames\nthat we expect, or at\nall. If we are not\nable to integrate our\nacquisitions\nsuccessfully, our\nresults of operations,\nfinancial condition\nand cash flows could\nbe adversely affected.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    59  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The use of\nfair value to measure\nfinancial instruments\nis fundamental to our\nrisk management\npractices and is our\nmost critical\naccounting policy.\n\nThe fair value of a\nfinancial instrument\nis the amount that\nwould be received to\nsell an asset or paid\nto transfer a\nliability in an\norderly transaction\nbetween market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date. We\nmeasure certain\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based\non its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit\nrisks). In determining\nfair value, the\nhierarchy under U.S.\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles\n(U.S. GAAP) gives (i)\nthe highest priority\nto unadjusted quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets for identical,\nunrestricted assets or\nliabilities (level 1\ninputs), (ii) the next\npriority to inputs\nother than level 1\ninputs that are\nobservable, either\ndirectly or indirectly\n(level 2 inputs), and\n(iii) the lowest\npriority to inputs\nthat cannot be\nobserved in market\nactivity (level 3\ninputs). In evaluating\nthe significance of a\nvaluation input, we\nconsider, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s\nnet risk exposure to\nthat input. Assets and\nliabilities are\nclassified in their\nentirety based on the\nlowest level of input\nthat is significant to\ntheir fair value\nmeasurement.\n\nThe fair values for\nsubstantially all of\nour financial assets\nand liabilities are\nbased on observable\nprices and inputs and\nare classified in\nlevels 1 and 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\nCertain level 2 and\nlevel 3 financial\nassets and liabilities\nmay require\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments that a\nmarket participant\nwould require to\narrive at fair value\nfor factors, such as\ncounterparty and our\ncredit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer\nrestrictions,\nliquidity and\nbid/offer spreads.\n\nInstruments classified\nin level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy are\nthose which require\none or more\nsignificant inputs\nthat are not\nobservable. Level 3\nfinancial assets\nrepresented 1.2% as of\nDecember 2024 and 1.5%\nas of December 2023 of\nour total assets.

Absent\nevidence to the\ncontrary, instruments\nclassified in level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy are\ninitially valued at\ntransaction price,\nwhich is considered to\nbe the best initial\nestimate of fair\nvalue. Subsequent to\nthe transaction date,\nwe use other\nmethodologies to\ndetermine fair value,\nwhich vary based on\nthe type of\ninstrument. Estimating\nthe fair value of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstruments requires\njudgments to be made.\nThese judgments\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Determining the\nappropriate valuation\nmethodology and/or\nmodel for each type of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstrument;\n\n\u2022 Determining model\ninputs based on an\nevaluation of all\nrelevant empirical\nmarket data, including\nprices evidenced by\nmarket transactions,\ninterest rates, credit\nspreads, volatilities\nand correlations; and\n\n\u2022 Determining\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments, including\nthose related to\nilliquidity or\ncounterparty credit\nquality.\n\nRegardless of the\nmethodology, valuation\ninputs and assumptions\nare only changed when\ncorroborated by\nsubstantive evidence.\n                                      \n  64    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In the event\nthat there is a\ndifference of opinion\nin situations where\nestimating the fair\nvalue of financial\ninstruments requires\njudgment (e.g.,\ncalibration to market\ncomparables or trade\ncomparison, as\ndescribed below), the\nfinal valuation\ndecision is made by\nsenior managers in our\nindependent price\nverification function\nwithin Controllers.\nThis independent price\nverification is\ncritical to ensuring\nthat our financial\ninstruments are\nproperly valued.\n\nPrice Verification.\nAll financial\ninstruments at fair\nvalue classified in\nlevels 1, 2 and 3 of\nthe fair value\nhierarchy are subject\nto our independent\nprice verification\nprocess.

The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. We\napply judgment in\nweighting individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including our\ninternally derived\neconomic outlook,\nmarket consensus,\nrecent macroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios. Risk\nfactors for wholesale\nloans include internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators (e.g.,\nunemployment rates and\nGDP), the borrower\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its\nfinancial obligations,\nthe borrower\u2019s country\nof risk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. In\naddition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nthe loan-to-value\nratio, debt service\nratio and home price\nindex. The allowance\nfor loan losses for\nwholesale loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics,\nsuch as nonaccrual\nloans, is calculated\nusing the present\nvalue of expected\nfuture cash flows\ndiscounted at the\nloan\u2019s effective rate,\nthe observable market\nprice of the loan, or,\nin the case of\ncollateral dependent\nloans, the fair value\nof the collateral less\nestimated costs to\nsell, if applicable.\nRisk factors for\ninstallment and credit\ncard loans include\nFair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators.\n\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses also\nincludes qualitative\ncomponents which allow\nmanagement to reflect\nthe uncertain nature\nof economic\nforecasting, capture\nuncertainty regarding\nmodel inputs, and\naccount for model\nimprecision and\nconcentration risk.\nThe qualitative\nfactors considered by\nmanagement include,\namong others, changes\nand trends in loan\nportfolios,\nuncertainties\nassociated with the\nmacroeconomic and\ngeopolitical\nenvironments, credit\nconcentrations,\nchanges in volume and\nseverity of past due\nand criticized loans,\nidiosyncratic events\nand deterioration\nwithin an industry or\nregion.\n\nOur estimate of credit\nlosses entails\njudgment about\ncollectability at the\nreporting dates, and\nthere are\nuncertainties inherent\nin those judgments.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses is\nsubject to a\ngovernance process\nthat involves senior\nmanagement within Risk\nand Controllers.\nPersonnel within Risk\nare responsible for\nforecasting the\neconomic variables\nthat underlie the\neconomic scenarios\nthat are used in the\nmodeling of expected\ncredit losses. While\nwe use the best\ninformation available\nto determine this\nestimate, future\nadjustments to the\nallowance may be\nnecessary based on,\namong other things,\nchanges in the\neconomic environment\nor variances between\nactual results and the\noriginal assumptions\nused. Loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\n\nWe also record an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on lending\ncommitments which are\nheld for investment\nthat are accounted for\nat amortized cost.\nSuch allowance is\ndetermined using the\nsame methodology as\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses, while also\ntaking into\nconsideration the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding,\nand whether such\ncommitments are\ncancellable by us.\n\nTo estimate the\npotential impact of an\nadverse macroeconomic\nenvironment on our\nallowance for credit\nlosses, we, among\nother things, compared\nthe expected credit\nlosses under the\nweighted average\nforecast used in the\ncalculation of\nallowance for credit\nlosses as of December\n2024 (which was\nweighted towards the\nbaseline and adverse\neconomic scenarios) to\nthe expected credit\nlosses under a 100%\nweighted adverse\neconomic scenario. The\nadverse economic\nscenario of the\nforecast model\nreflects a global\nrecession in the first\nquarter of 2025\nthrough the first\nquarter of 2026,\nresulting in an\neconomic contraction\nand rising\nunemployment rates. A\n100% weighting to the\nadverse economic\nscenario would have\nresulted in an\napproximate $0.9\nbillion increase in\nour allowance for\ncredit losses as of\nDecember 2024. This\nhypothetical increase\ndoes not take into\nconsideration any\npotential adjustments\nto qualitative\nreserves. The\nforecasts of\nmacroeconomic\nconditions are\ninherently uncertain\nand do not take into\naccount any other\noffsetting or\ncorrelated effects.\nThe actual credit loss\nin an adverse\nmacroeconomic\nenvironment may differ\nsignificantly from\nthis estimate.

When assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its carrying\nvalue. If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment. Estimating\nthe fair value of our\nreporting units\nrequires judgment.\nCritical inputs to the\nfair value estimates\ninclude projected\nearnings, allocated\nequity, price-to-\nearnings multiples and\nprice-to-book\nmultiples. There is\ninherent uncertainty\nin the projected\nearnings. The carrying\nvalue of each\nreporting unit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nDuring the third\nquarter of 2024, in\nconnection with the\nplanned sale of our\nseller financing loan\nportfolio, we\nperformed a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest and determined\nthat the goodwill\nassociated with\nTransaction banking\nand other was\nimpaired, and\naccordingly, recorded\na $14 million\nimpairment. In the\nfourth quarter of\n2024, we performed our\nannual assessment of\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, for each\nof our reporting units\nwith goodwill, by\nperforming a\nqualitative\nassessment. As a\nresult of the annual\nassessment, we\ndetermined that it was\nmore likely than not\nthat the estimated\nfair value of each\nreporting unit with\ngoodwill exceeded its\nrespective carrying\nvalue. Therefore, we\ndetermined that\ngoodwill for each\nreporting unit was not\nimpaired and that a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest was not required.\nSee Note 12 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\nannual assessment of\ngoodwill for\nimpairment. If we\nexperience a prolonged\nor severe period of\nweakness in the\nbusiness environment,\nfinancial markets, the\nperformance of one or\nmore of our reporting\nunits or our common\nstock price, or\nadditional increases\nin capital\nrequirements, our\ngoodwill could be\nimpaired in the\nfuture.\n\nIdentifiable\nintangible assets are\ntested for impairment\nwhen events or changes\nin circumstances\nsuggest that an\nasset\u2019s or asset\ngroup\u2019s carrying value\nmay not be fully\nrecoverable. Judgment\nis required to\nevaluate whether\nindications of\npotential impairment\nhave occurred, and to\ntest identifiable\nintangible assets for\nimpairment, if\nrequired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated undiscounted\ncash flows relating to\nthe asset or asset\ngroup is less than the\ncorresponding carrying\nvalue. During 2024, in\nconnection with the\nplanned transition of\nthe GM credit card\nprogram to another\nissuer, we classified\nthe GM credit card\nprogram to held for\nsale and recognized a\n$72 million write-down\nof identifiable\nintangible assets. See\nNote 12 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\nidentifiable\nintangible assets.\n\nWe also estimate and\nprovide for potential\nlosses that may arise\nout of litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nto the extent that\nsuch losses are\nprobable and can be\nreasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we\nestimate the upper end\nof the range of\nreasonably possible\naggregate loss in\nexcess of the related\nreserves for\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nwhere we believe the\nrisk of loss is more\nthan slight. See Notes\n18 and 27 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for\ninformation about\ncertain judicial,\nlitigation and\nregulatory\nproceedings.\nSignificant judgment\nis required in making\nthese estimates and\nour final liabilities\nmay ultimately be\nmaterially different.\nOur total estimated\nliability in respect\nof litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nis determined on a\ncase-by-case basis and\nrepresents an estimate\nof probable losses\nafter considering,\namong other factors,\nthe progress of each\ncase, proceeding or\ninvestigation, our\nexperience and the\nexperience of others\nin similar cases,\nproceedings or\ninvestig ations, and\nthe opinions and views\nof legal counsel.\n\nIn accounting for\nincome taxes, we\nrecognize tax\npositions in the\nfinancial statements\nonly when it is more\nlikely than not that\nthe position will be\nsustained on\nexamination by the\nrelevant taxing\nauthority based on the\ntechnical merits of\nthe position. As of\nDecember 2024, our\nliability for\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits was $2.16\nbillion.

Due to the\nintegrated nature of\nour market-making\nactivities,\ndisaggregation of net\nrevenues into client\nactivity and market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges is judgmental\nand has inherent\ncomplexities and\nlimitations. The\namount and composition\nof our net revenues\nvary over time as\nthese drivers are\nimpacted by multiple\ninterrelated factors\naffecting economic and\nmarket conditions,\nincluding volatility\nand liquidity in the\nmarket, changes in\ninterest rates,\ncurrency exchange\nrates, credit spreads,\nequity prices and\ncommodity prices,\ninvestor confidence,\nand other\nmacroeconomic concerns\nand uncertainties. In\ngeneral, assuming all\nother market-making\nconditions remain\nconstant, increases in\nclient activity levels\nor bid/offer spreads\ntend to result in\nincreases in net\nrevenues, and\ndecreases tend to have\nthe opposite effect.\nHowever, changes in\nmarket-making\nconditions can\nmaterially impact\nclient activity levels\nand bid/offer spreads,\nas well as the fair\nvalue of our\ninventory. For\nexample, a decrease in\nliquidity in the\nmarket could have the\nimpact of (i)\nincreasing our\nbid/offer spread, (ii)\ndecreasing investor\nconfidence and thereby\ndecreasing client\nactivity levels, and\n(iii) widening of\ncredit spreads on our\ninventory positions.\nOther.

See\nNote 25 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for net\ninterest income by\nsegment. \u2022 The primary\ndriver of net revenues\nfor FICC\nintermediation for all\nperiods was client\nactivity. \u2022 The\nincrease in net\ninterest income within\nFICC for 2024 compared\nwith 2023 reflected an\nincrease in interest-\nearning assets. Due to\nthe nature of\nactivities within FICC\nand Equities and the\ncomposition of their\nassociated balance\nsheet, we assess the\nperformance of these\nbusinesses based on\ntotal net revenues, as\noffsets can occur\nacross revenue line\nitems.

During 2024, Global Banking &\nMarkets operated in an environment generally\ncharacterized by continued broad macroeconomic\nconcerns, including concerns and uncertainty\nabout inflation, prolonged geopolitical\nstresses and central bank policy, and the\npotential outcomes of the national elections.\nIn investment banking, industry-wide debt\nunderwriting volumes for the year increased\nsignificantly compared with the prior year,\ndriven by strong levels of leveraged finance\nand investment-grade offerings. However,\nindustry-wide equity underwriting volumes,\ndespite improving year-over-year, and\nindustry-wide completed mergers and\nacquisitions volumes remained below historical\naverages. In interest rates, the yields on\n10-year U.S. and U.K. government bonds\nincreased during the year. In equities, the\nS&P 500 Index increased by 23% and the MSCI\nWorld Index increased by 16% compared with the\nend of 2023. In the future, if market and\neconomic conditions deteriorate, and market-\nmaking activity levels decline, industry-wide\ninvestment banking volumes decline, or credit\nspreads related to hedges on our relationship\nlending portfolio tighten, net revenues in\nGlobal Banking & Markets would likely be\nnegatively impacted. In addition, if economic\nconditions deteriorate or if the\ncreditworthiness of borrowers deteriorates,\nprovision for credit losses would likely be\nnegatively impacted.\n                                      \n  74    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During 2024, Asset &\nWealth Management operated in an environment\ngenerally characterized by continued broad\nmacroeconomic concerns, including persistent\nconcerns about the commercial real estate\nmarket. However, global equity prices were\ngenerally higher compared with the end of\n2023, positively affecting assets under\nsupervision. In the future, if market and\neconomic conditions deteriorate, it may lead\nto a decline in asset prices, or investors\ntransitioning to asset classes that typically\ngenerate lower fees or withdrawing their\nassets, and net revenues in Asset & Wealth\nManagement would likely be negatively\nimpacted. 2024 versus 2023 . Net revenues in\nAsset & Wealth Management were $16.14 billion\nfor 2024, 16% higher than 2023, primarily\nreflecting significantly higher net revenues\nin Equity investments and higher Management\nand other fees. In addition, net revenues in\nPrivate banking and lending and Incentive fees\nwere higher, while net revenues in Debt\ninvestments were lower. The increase in Equity\ninvestments net revenues primarily reflected\nsignificantly higher net gains from\ninvestments in private equities (largely\nreflecting the impact of net losses in real\nestate investments in the prior year). The\nincrease in Management and other fees\nprimarily reflected the impact of higher\naverage assets under supervision. The increase\nin Private banking and lending net revenues\nprimarily reflected the impact of the sale of\nthe Marcus loan portfolio in 2023 (including\nnet revenues of approximately $(370) million\nrelated to the sale of substantially all of\nthe portfolio) and the impact of higher\ndirect-to-consumer deposit balances. The\nincrease in Incentive fees was driven by\nharvesting. The decrease in Debt investments\nnet revenues reflected lower net interest\nincome due to a reduction in the debt\ninvestments balance sheet, partially offset by\nnet gains in the current year compared with\nnet losses (particularly in real estate\ninvestments) in the prior year. Provision for\ncredit losses was a net benefit of $232\nmillion for 2024, compared with a net benefit\nof $508 million for 2023. The net benefit for\n2024 reflected a net benefit related to the\nwholesale portfolio (driven by paydowns). The\nnet benefit for 2023 primarily reflected\nreserve reductions related to the sale of\nsubstantially all of the Marcus loan portfolio\nand lower balances in corporate loans,\npartially offset by impairments. Operating\nexpenses were $11.83 billion for 2024, 9%\nlower than 2023, due to significantly lower\nexpenses, including impairments, related to\ncommercial real estate in CIEs, partially\noffset by higher compensation and benefits\nexpenses (reflecting improved operating\nperformance). Pre-tax earnings were $4.55\nbillion for 2024, compared with $1.36 billion\nfor 2023.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    77  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The operating\nenvironment for Platform Solutions is mainly\nimpacted by the economic environment in the\nU.S., which, during 2024, was generally\ncharacterized by concerns about inflation\n(although some measures had begun to improve),\na continued low rate of unemployment and a\nslight increase in the pace of growth in\nconsumer spending compared with 2023. In the\nfuture, if economic conditions deteriorate, it\nmay lead to a decrease in consumer spending or\na deterioration in consumer credit, and net\nrevenues and provision for credit losses in\nPlatform Solutions would likely be negatively\nimpacted. 2024 versus 2023. Net revenues in\nPlatform Solutions were $2.43 billion for\n2024, 2% higher than 2023. Notwithstanding our\nstrategic decision to narrow the focus on\nconsumer-related activities, Consumer\nplatforms net revenues were slightly higher\ncompared with 2023, reflecting higher average\ncredit card balances and higher average\ndeposit balances, largely offset by the impact\nof the planned transition of the GM credit\ncard program to another issuer. Transaction\nbanking and other net revenues were lower,\nprimarily reflecting lower net revenues\nrelated to the seller financing loan portfolio\nthat was sold during 2024. See \u201cRegulatory and\nOther Matters \u2014 Other Matters \u2014 Narrowing our\nFocus on Consumer-Related Activities\u201d for\nfurther information.\n\nProvision for credit losses was $1.54 billion\nfor 2024, compared with $1.14 billion for\n2023. Provisions for 2024 reflected net\nprovisions related to the credit card\nportfolio (primarily driven by net charge-\noffs). The net provision for 2023 reflected\nnet provisions related to the credit card\nportfolio (primarily driven by net charge-\noffs), partially offset by a net release\nrelated to the GreenSky loan portfolio\n(including a reserve reduction related to the\ntransfer of the portfolio to held for sale).\nOperating expenses were $1.96 billion for\n2024, 43% lower than 2023, primarily due to\nthe write-down of identifiable intangible\nassets related to GreenSky and an impairment\nof goodwill related to Consumer platforms in\nthe prior year period. Pre-tax loss was $1.08\nbillion for 2024, compared with a pre-tax loss\nof $2.18 billion for 2023.

Balance Sheet and Funding\nSources Balance Sheet Management One of our\nrisk management disciplines is our ability to\nmanage the size and composition of our balance\nsheet. While our asset base changes due to\nclient activity, market fluctuations and\nbusiness opportunities, the size and\ncomposition of our balance sheet also reflects\nfactors, including (i) our overall risk\ntolerance, (ii) the amount of capital we hold\nand (iii) our funding profile, among other\nfactors. See \u201cCapital Management and\nRegulatory Capital \u2014 Capital Management\u201d for\ninformation about our capital management\nprocess. Although our balance sheet fluctuates\non a day-to-day basis, our total assets at\nquarter-end are generally not materially\ndifferent from those occurring within our\nreporting periods. In order to ensure\nappropriate risk management, we seek to\nmaintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet\nand have processes in place to dynamically\nmanage our assets and liabilities, which\ninclude (i) balance sheet planning, (ii)\nsetting balance sheet targets, (iii)\nmonitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario\nanalyses.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    83  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We prepare a\nbalance sheet plan\nthat combines our\nprojected total assets\nand composition of\nassets with our\nexpected funding\nsources over a three-\nyear time horizon.\nThis plan is reviewed\nquarterly and may be\nadjusted in response\nto changing business\nneeds or market\nconditions. The\nobjectives of this\nplanning process are:\n\n\u2022 To develop our\nbalance sheet\nprojections, taking\ninto account the\ngeneral state of the\nfinancial markets and\nexpected business\nactivity levels, as\nwell as regulatory\nrequirements;\n\n\u2022 To allow Corporate\nTreasury to evaluate\nbalance sheet targets\nof our revenue-\nproducing units and\nrequests to change\nsuch targets in the\ncontext of our overall\nbalance sheet\nconstraints, including\nour liability profile\nand capital levels,\nand key metrics; and\n\n\u2022 To inform the target\namount, tenor and type\nof funding to raise,\nbased on our projected\nassets and contractual\nmaturities.\n\nCorporate Treasury and\nRisk, along with our\nrevenue-producing\nunits, review current\nand prior period\ninformation and\nexpectations for the\nyear to prepare our\nbalance sheet plan.\nThe specific\ninformation reviewed\nincludes asset and\nliability size and\ncomposition, target\nutilization, risk and\nperformance measures,\nand capital usage.\n\nOur consolidated\nbalance sheet plan,\nincluding our balance\nsheets by business,\nfunding projections\nand projected key\nmetrics, is reviewed\nand approved by the\nFirmwide Asset\nLiability Committee.\nSee \u201cRisk Management \u2014\nOverview and Structure\nof Risk Management\u201d\nfor an overview of our\nrisk management\nstructure.\n\nSetting Balance Sheet\nTargets. We set\nbalance sheet targets\nwith the aim of\nensuring that our\nconsolidated balance\nsheet, as well as the\nbalance sheets for our\nbusinesses remain\nwithin our risk\nappetite. The Firmwide\nAsset Liability\nCommittee has the\nresponsibility to\nreview and approve\nbalance sheet targets\nat least quarterly.\nOur balance sheet\ntargets are set at\nlevels which are close\nto actual operating\nlevels, rather than at\nlevels which reflect\nour maximum risk\nappetite, in order to\nensure prompt\nescalation and\ndiscussion among our\nrevenue-producing\nunits, Corporate\nTreasury and Risk.\nRequests for changes\nin targets are\nevaluated after giving\nconsideration to their\nimpact on our key\nmetrics. Compliance\nwith targets is\nmonitored by our\nrevenue-producing\nunits, Corporate\nTreasury and Risk.\n\nMonitoring of Key\nMetrics. We monitor\nkey balance sheet\nmetrics both by\nbusiness and on a\nconsolidated basis,\nincluding asset and\nliability size and\ncomposition, target\nutilization and risk\nmeasures. We attribute\nassets to businesses\nand review and analyze\nmovements resulting\nfrom new business\nactivity, as well as\nmarket fluctuations.\n\nScenario Analyses. We\nconduct various\nscenario analyses,\nincluding as part of\nthe Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR) and U.S.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act Stress\nTests (DFAST), as well\nas our resolution and\nrecovery planning. See\n\u201cCapital Management\nand Regulatory Capital\n\u2014 Capital Management\u201d\nfor further\ninformation about\nthese scenario\nanalyses. These\nscenarios cover short-\nand long-term time\nhorizons using various\nmacroeconomic and\nfirm-specific\nassumptions, based on\na range of economic\nscenarios. We use\nthese analyses to\nassist us in\ndeveloping our longer-\nterm balance sheet\nmanagement strategy,\nincluding the level\nand composition of\nassets, funding and\ncapital. Additionally,\nthese analyses help us\ndevelop approaches for\nmaintaining\nappropriate funding,\nliquidity and capital\nacross a variety of\nsituations, including\na severely stressed\nenvironment.\n                                              \n   Balance Sheet Analysis and Metrics         \n                                              \nAs of December 2024,\ntotal assets in our\nconsolidated balance\nsheets were $1.68\ntrillion, an increase\nof $34.38 billion from\nDecember 2023,\nreflecting increases\nin trading assets of\n$93.05 billion\n(primarily due to an\nincrease in government\nobligations,\nreflecting the impact\nof our and our\nclients\u2019 activities),\ninvestments of $37.68\nbillion (primarily due\nto an increase in U.S.\ngovernment obligations\naccounted for as\navailable-for-sale)\nand loans of $12.84\nbillion (primarily\nreflecting our\nclients\u2019 activities),\npartially offset by\ndecreases in cash and\ncash equivalents of\n$59.49 billion\n(primarily reflecting\nour activity) and\ncollateralized\nagreements of $48.52\nbillion (primarily\nreflecting our\nactivity).

We\nfund a significant\namount of inventory\nand a portion of\ninvestments on a\nsecured basis. Secured\nfunding includes\ncollateralized\nfinancings in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets. See Note 11 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about our\ncollateralized\nfinancings, including\nits maturity profile.\nWe may also pledge our\ninventory and\ninvestments as\ncollateral for\nsecurities borrowed\nunder a securities\nlending agreement. We\nalso use our own\ninventory and\ninvestments to cover\ntransactions in which\nwe or our clients have\nsold securities that\nhave not yet been\npurchased. Secured\nfunding is less\nsensitive to changes\nin our credit quality\nthan unsecured\nfunding, due to our\nposting of collateral\nto our lenders.\nNonetheless, we\nanalyze the\nrefinancing risk of\nour secured funding\nactivities, taking\ninto account trade\ntenors, maturity\nprofiles, counterparty\nconcentrations,\ncollateral eligibility\nand counterparty\nrollover\nprobabilities. We seek\nto mitigate our\nrefinancing risk by\nexecuting term trades\nwith staggered\nmaturities,\ndiversifying\ncounterparties,\nraising excess secured\nfunding and pre-\nfunding residual risk\nthrough our GCLA. We\nseek to raise secured\nfunding with a term\nappropriate for the\nliquidity of the\nassets that are being\nfinanced, and we seek\nlonger maturities for\nsecured funding\ncollateralized by\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis,\nespecially during\ntimes of market\nstress. Our secured\nfunding, excluding\nfunding collateralized\nby liquid government\nand agency\nobligations, is\nprimarily executed for\ntenors of one month or\ngreater and is\nprimarily executed\nthrough term\nrepurchase agreements\nand securities loaned\ncontracts. Assets that\nmay be harder to fund\non a secured basis\nduring times of market\nstress include certain\nfinancial instruments\nin the following\ncategories: mortgage-\nand other asset-backed\nloans and securities,\nnon-investment-grade\ncorporate debt\nsecurities, equity\nsecurities and\nemerging market\nsecurities. We also\nraise financing\nthrough other types of\ncollateralized\nfinancings, such as\nsecured loans and\nnotes. GS Bank USA has\naccess to funding from\nthe Federal Home Loan\nBank. Our outstanding\nborrowings from the\nFederal Home Loan Bank\nwere $5.04 billion as\nof December 2024 and\nwe had no outstanding\nborrowings as of\nDecember 2023.\nAdditionally, we have\naccess to funding\nthrough the Federal\nReserve discount\nwindow, but we do not\nrely on this funding\nin our liquidity\nplanning and stress\ntesting.\n\nUnsecured Short-Term\nBorrowings. A\nsignificant portion of\nour unsecured short-\nterm borrowings was\noriginally long-term\ndebt that is scheduled\nto mature within one\nyear of the reporting\ndate. We use unsecured\nshort-term borrowings,\nincluding U.S. and\nnon-U.S. hybrid\nfinancial instruments\nand commercial paper,\nto finance liquid\nassets and for other\ncash management\npurposes. In\naccordance with\nregulatory\nrequirements, Group\nInc. does not issue\ndebt with an original\nmaturity of less than\none year, other than\nto its subsidiaries.\nSee Note 14 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\nunsecured short-term\nborrowings. Unsecured\nLong-Term Borrowings.\nUnsecured long-term\nborrowings, including\nstructured notes, are\nraised through\nsyndicated U.S.\nregistered offerings,\nU.S. registered and\nRule 144A medium-term\nnote programs,\noffshore medium-term\nnote offerings and\nother debt offerings.\nWe issue in different\ntenors, currencies and\nproducts to maximize\nthe diversification of\nour investor base.

As part of\ncapital planning, we\nproject sources and\nuses of capital given\na range of business\nenvironments,\nincluding stressed\nconditions. Our stress\ntesting process is\ndesigned to identify\nand measure material\nrisks associated with\nour business\nactivities, including\nmarket risk, credit\nrisk, operational risk\nand liquidity risk, as\nwell as our ability to\ngenerate revenues.\n\nOur capital planning\nprocess incorporates\nan internal capital\nadequacy assessment\nwith the objective of\nensuring that we are\nappropriately\ncapitalized relative\nto the risks in our\nbusinesses. We\nincorporate stress\nscenarios into our\ncapital planning\nprocess with a goal of\nholding sufficient\ncapital to ensure we\nremain adequately\ncapitalized after\nexperiencing a severe\nstress event. Our\nassessment of capital\nadequacy is viewed in\ntandem with our\nassessment of\nliquidity adequacy and\nis integrated into our\noverall risk\nmanagement structure,\ngovernance and policy\nframework.\n\nOur stress tests\nincorporate our\ninternally designed\nstress scenarios,\nincluding our\ninternally developed\nseverely adverse\nscenario, and those\nrequired by the FRB,\nand are designed to\ncapture our specific\nvulnerabilities and\nrisks. We provide\nfurther information\nabout our stress test\nprocesses and a\nsummary of the results\non our website as\ndescribed in \u201cBusiness\n\u2014 Available\nInformation\u201d in Part\nI, Item 1 of this Form\n10-K.\n\nAs required by the\nFRB\u2019s CCAR rules, we\nsubmit an annual\ncapital plan for\nreview by the FRB. The\npurpose of the FRB\u2019s\nreview is to ensure\nthat we have a robust,\nforward-looking\ncapital planning\nprocess that accounts\nfor our unique risks\nand that permits\ncontinued operation\nduring times of\neconomic and financial\nstress.\n\nThe FRB evaluates us\nbased, in part, on\nwhether we have the\ncapital necessary to\ncontinue operating\nunder the baseline and\nseverely adverse\nscenarios provided by\nthe FRB and those\ndeveloped internally.\nThis evaluation also\ntakes into account our\nprocess for\nidentifying risk, our\ncontrols and\ngovernance for capital\nplanning, and our\nguidelines for making\ncapital planning\ndecisions. In\naddition, the FRB\nevaluates our plan to\nmake capital\ndistributions (i.e.,\ndividend payments and\nrepurchases or\nredemptions of stock,\nsubordinated debt or\nother capital\nsecurities) and issue\ncapital, across the\nrange of macroeconomic\nscenarios and firm-\nspecific assumptions.\nThe FRB determines the\nSCB applicable to us\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\nThe SCB under the\nStandardized approach\nis calculated as (i)\nthe difference between\nour starting and\nminimum projected CET1\ncapital ratios under\nthe supe rvisory\nseverely adverse\nscenario and (ii) our\nplanned common stock\ndividends for each of\nthe fourth through\nseventh quarters of\nthe planning horizon,\nexpressed as a\npercentage of RWAs.\n\nBased on our 2024 CCAR\nsubmission, the FRB\nincreased our SCB from\n5.5% to 6.2%,\nresulting in a\nStandardized CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement of 13.7%\nfor the period from\nOctober 1, 2024\nthrough September 30,\n2025.

As part of our\ncomprehensive capital\nmanagement policy, we\nmaintain a contingency\ncapital plan. Our\ncontingency capital\nplan provides a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nperceived or actual\ncapital deficiency,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to,\nidentification of\ndrivers of a capital\ndeficiency, as well as\nmitigants and\npotential actions. It\noutlines the\nappropriate\ncommunication\nprocedures to follow\nduring a crisis\nperiod, including\ninternal dissemination\nof information, as\nwell as timely\ncommunication with\nexternal stakeholders.\n\nCapital Attribution.\nWe assess the capital\nusage of each of our\nbusinesses based on\nour attributed equity\nframework. This\nframework considers\nmany factors,\nincluding our internal\nassessment of risks as\nwell as the regulatory\ncapital requirements\nrelated to our\nbusiness activities .\n\nWe review and make any\nnecessary adjustments\nto our attributed\nequity in January each\nyear, to reflect,\namong other things,\nour most recent stress\ntest results and\nchanges to our\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. On\nJanuary 1, 2024, our\nallocation of\nattributed equity\nchanged (relative to\nthe allocation as of\nDecember 2023) as\nfollows: attributed\nequity increased by\napproximately $1.6\nbillion for Platform\nSolutions, while\nattributed equity\ndecreased by\napproximately $1.2\nbillion for Asset &\nWealth Management and\napproximately $0.4\nbillion for Global\nBanking & Markets. On\nJanuary 1, 2025, our\nallocation of\nattributed equity\nchanged (relative to\nthe allocation as of\nDecember 2024) as\nfollows: attributed\nequity increased by\napproximately $0.4\nbillion for Global\nBanking & Markets,\nwhile attributed\nequity decreased by\napproximately $0.3\nbillion for Asset &\nWealth Management and\napproximately $0.1\nbillion for Platform\nSolutions. See\n\u201cResults of Operations\n\u2014 Segment Assets and\nOperating Results \u2014\nSegment Operating\nResults\u201d for\ninformation about our\naverage quarterly\nattributed equity by\nsegment.\n\nShare Repur chase\nProgram. We use our\nshare repurchase\nprogram to help\nmaintain the\nappropriate level of\ncommon equity. On an\nannual basis, we\nsubmit a Board of\nDirectors of Group\nInc. ( Board) approved\ncapital plan to the\nFederal Reserve, which\nincludes planned share\nrepurchases for each\nquarter. The share\nrepurchases are\neffected primarily\nthrough regular open-\nmarket purchases\n(which may include\nrepurchase plans\ndesigned to comply\nwith Rule 10b5-1 and\naccelerated share\nrepurchases), the\namounts and timing of\nwhich are determined\nprimarily by our\ncurrent and projected\ncapital position, and\ncapital deployment\nopportunities, but\nwhich may also be\ninfluenced by general\nmarket conditions and\nthe prevailing price\nand trading volumes of\nour common stock.\n\nIn 2023, the Board\napproved a share\nrepurchase program\nauthorizing\nrepurchases of up to\n$30 billion of our\ncommon stock. The\nprogram has no set\nexpiration or\ntermination date. See\n\u201cMarket for\nRegistrant\u2019s Common\nEquity, Related\nStockholder Matters\nand Issuer Purchases\nof Equity Securities\u201d\nin Part II, Item 5 of\nthis Form 10-K and\nNote 19 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\nshare repurchase\nprogram, and see above\nfor information about\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess.\n\nDuring 2024, we\nreturned a total of\n$11.80 billion of\ncapital to common\nshareholders,\nincluding $8.00\nbillion of common\nshare repurchases and\n$3.80 billion of\ncommon stock\ndividends. Consistent\nwith our capital\nmanagement philosophy,\nwe will continue\nprioritizing\ndeployment of capital\nfor our clients where\nreturns are attractive\nand distribute any\nexcess capital to\nshareholders through\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, while\ntargeting a 50 to 100\nbasis point buffer\nabove our capital\nrequirement.\n\nWe are subject to a\none percent non-\ndeductible federal\nexcise tax (buyback\ntax) that is\napplicable to the fair\nmarket value of\ncertain corporate\nshare repurchases. The\nfair market value of\nshare repurchases\nsubject to the tax is\nreduced by the fair\nmarket value of any\napplicable stock\nissued during the\ncalendar year,\nincluding stock issued\nto employees. The\nbuyback tax did not\nhave a material impact\non our financial\ncondition, results of\noperations or cash\nflows for 2024.\n\nResolution Capital\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established a\nResolution Capital\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich is designed to\nensure that our major\nsubsidiaries (GS Bank\nUSA, Goldman Sachs &\nCo.

In\naddition, credit\nrating agencies have\nassigned ratings to\ndebt obligations of\ncertain other\nsubsidiaries of Group\nInc. The level and\ncomposition of our\ncapital are among the\nmany factors\nconsidered in\ndetermining our credit\nratings. Each agency\nhas its own definition\nof eligible capital\nand methodology for\nevaluating capital\nadequacy, and\nassessments are\ngenerally based on a\ncombination of factors\nrather than a single\ncalculation.

The capital\nrequirements\ncalculated under the\nCapital Framework\ninclude the capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements, which\nare comprised of a\n2.5% buffer (under the\nAdvanced Capital\nRules), the SCB (under\nthe Standardized\nCapital Rules), a\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer (under\nboth Capital Rules)\nand the G-SIB\nsurcharge (under both\nCapital Rules). Our\nG-SIB surcharge is\n3.0% for both 2024 and\n2025 and is expected\nto be 3.5% beginning\nin 2026. The G-SIB\nsurcharge and\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer in the\nfuture may differ due\nto additional guidance\nfrom our regulators\nand/or positional\nchanges, and our SCB\ncan change\nsignificantly from\nyear to year based on\nthe results of the\nannual supervisory\nstress tests. Our\ntarget is to maintain\ncapital ratios equal\nto the regulatory\nrequirements plus a\nbuffer of 50 to 100\nbasis points. See Note\n20 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about our\nrisk-based capital\nratios and leverage\nratios, and the\nCapital Framework.\n\nTotal Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity (TLAC) We are\nalso subject to the\nFRB\u2019s TLAC and related\nrequirements.

Regulations have been adopted or\nare being considered by regulators and policy\nmakers worldwide. Given that many of the new\nand proposed rules are highly complex, the\nfull impact of regulatory reform will not be\nknown until the rules are implemented and\nmarket practices develop under the final\nregulations.

Other Matters Narrowing our Focus\non Consumer-Related Activities. During 2023\nand 2024, we narrowed our focus with respect\nto consumer-related activities by taking the\nfollowing actions: \u2022 We completed the sale of\nsubstantially all of the Marcus loan portfolio\nin 2023 (included within Asset & Wealth\nManagement). \u2022 We sold our PFM business in\n2023 (included within Asset & Wealth\nManagement). \u2022 We sold the majority of the\nGreenSky loan portfolio in 2023 and, during\n2024, completed the sale of GreenSky (included\nwithin Platform Solutions). \u2022 During 2024, we\nentered into an agreement to transition the GM\ncredit card program (included within Platform\nSolutions) to another issuer. The transition\nis expected to be completed in the third\nquarter of 2025. \u2022 During 2024, we sold our\nseller financing loan portfolio (included\nwithin Platform Solutions). This portfolio\nconsisted of loans that were extended to\nsmall- and medium-sized retailers. We remain\ncommitted to supporting the products and\nservicing customers through the various\ntransition arrangements for our consumer-\nrelated activities.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    93  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Our\ninvolvement in these\narrangements can take\nmany different forms,\nincluding: \u2022\nPurchasing or\nretaining residual and\nother interests in\nspecial purpose\nentities, such as\nmortgage-backed and\nother asset-backed\nsecuritization\nvehicles; \u2022 Holding\nsenior and\nsubordinated debt,\ninterests in limited\nand general\npartnerships, and\npreferred and common\nstock in other\nnonconsolidated\nvehicles; \u2022 Entering\ninto interest rate,\nforeign currency,\nequity, commodity and\ncredit derivatives,\nincluding total return\nswaps; and \u2022 Providing\nguarantees,\nindemnifications,\ncommitments, letters\nof credit and\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. We enter\ninto these\narrangements for a\nvariety of business\npurposes, including\nsecuritizations. The\nsecuritization\nvehicles that purchase\nmortgages, corporate\nbonds and other types\nof financial assets\nare critical to the\nfunctioning of several\nsignificant investor\nmarkets, including the\nmortgage-backed and\nother asset-backed\nsecurities markets,\nsince they offer\ninvestors access to\nspecific cash flows\nand risks created\nthrough the\nsecuritization\nprocess.

Our risk\nmanagement structure\nis built around three\ncore components:\ngovernance, processes\nand people.\n\nGovernance. Risk\nmanagement governance\nstarts with the Board,\nwhich both directly\nand through its\ncommittees, including\nits Risk Committee,\noversees our approach\nto managing our risks\nthrough the enterprise\nrisk management\nframework. The Board\nis also responsible\nfor the annual review\nand approval of our\nrisk appetite\nstatement. The risk\nappetite statement\ndescribes the levels\nand types of risk we\nare willing to accept\nor to avoid in order\nto achieve our\nobjectives included in\nour strategy and\nbusiness plan, while\nremaining in\ncompliance with\nregulatory\nrequirements. The\nBoard reviews our\nstrategy and business\nplan and is ultimately\nresponsible for\noverseeing and\nproviding direction\nabout our strategy and\nrisk appetite.\n\nThe Board, including\nthrough its\ncommittees, receives\nregular briefings on\nfirmwide risks,\nincluding liquidity\nrisk, market risk,\ncredit risk,\noperational risk,\nmodel risk and climate\nrisk, from our chief\nrisk officer, on\ncybersecurity threats\nand risks from our\nchief information\nsecurity officer\n(CISO), on compliance\nrisk and conduct risk\nfrom our chief\ncompliance officer, on\nlegal and regulatory\nenforcement matters\nfrom our chief legal\nofficer, and on other\nmatters impacting our\nreputation from the\nchair and/or vice-\nchairs of our Firmwide\nReputational Risk\nCommittee. The chief\nrisk officer reports\nto our chief executive\nofficer and to the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard. As part of the\nreview of the firmwide\nrisk portfolio, the\nchief risk officer\nregularly advises the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard of relevant risk\nmetrics and material\nexposures, including\nrisk limits and\nthresholds established\nin our risk appetite\nstatement.\n\nEnterprise Risk, which\nreports to our chief\nrisk officer, is\nresponsible for\nensuring that our\nenterprise risk\nmanagement framework\nprovides the Board,\nour risk committees\nand senior management\nwith a consistent and\nintegrated approach to\nmanaging our various\nrisks in a manner\nconsistent with our\nrisk appetite.\n\nOur first line of\ndefense consists of\nour revenue-producing\nunits, Conflicts\nResolution,\nControllers,\nEngineering, Corporate\nTreasury and certain\nother corporate\nfunctions. The first\nline of defense is\nresponsible for its\nrisk-generating\nactivities, as well as\nfor the design and\nexecution of controls\nto mitigate such\nrisks.\n\nOur Risk and\nCompliance functions\nare considered our\nsecond line of defense\nand provide\nindependent\nassessment, oversight\nand challenge of the\nrisks taken by our\nfirst line of defense,\nas well as lead and\nparticipate in\nfirmwide risk\ncommittees.\n\nInternal Audit is\nconsidered our third\nline of defense, and\nour director of\nInternal Audit reports\nto the Audit Committee\nof the Board and\nadministratively to\nour chief executive\nofficer. Internal\nAudit includes\nprofessionals with a\nbroad range of audit\nand industry\nexperience, including\nrisk management\nexpertise. Internal\nAudit is responsible\nfor independently\nassessing and\nvalidating the\neffectiveness of key\ncontrols, including\nthose within the risk\nmanagement framework,\nand providing timely\nreporting to the Audit\nCommittee of the\nBoard, senior\nmanagement and\nregulators.\n\nThe three lines of\ndefense structure\npromotes the\naccountability of\nfirst line risk\ntakers, provides a\nframework for\neffective challenge by\nthe second line and\nempowers independent\nreview from the third\nline.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    95  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nProcesses. We maintain\nvarious processes that\nare critical\ncomponents of our risk\nmanagement framework,\nincluding (i) risk\nidentification and\nassessment, (ii) risk\nappetite, limits,\nthresholds and alerts,\n(iii) control\nmonitoring and\ntesting, and (iv) risk\nreporting.\n\n\u2022 Risk Identification\nand Assessment. We\nbelieve the\nidentification and\nassessment of our\nrisks is a critical\nstep in providing our\nBoard and senior\nmanagement\ntransparency and\ninsight into the range\nand materiality of our\nrisks. We have a\ncomprehensive data\ncollection process,\nincluding firmwide\npolicies and\nprocedures that\nrequire all employees\nto report and escalate\nrisk events. Our\napproach for risk\nidentification and\nassessment is\ncomprehensive across\nall risk types, is\ndynamic and forward-\nlooking to reflect and\nadapt to our changing\nrisk profile and\nbusiness environment,\nleverages subject\nmatter expertise, and\nallows for\nprioritization of our\nmost critical risks.\nWe perform risk\nassessments\nperiodically with the\naim of ensuring that\nour material financial\nand nonfinancial risks\nare mitigated through\ncontrols to an\nacceptable tolerance\nlevel in accordance\nwith our risk\nappetite. Our risk\nassessments include,\namong other things,\nthe use of stress\ntesting as well as an\nassessment of our\ninternal control\nprocesses designed to\nmitigate such risks.\n\nFirmwide stress\ntesting is an\nimportant part of our\nrisk management\nprocess. It allows us\nto quantify our\nexposure to tail\nrisks, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations,\nundertake risk/reward\nanalysis, and assess\nand mitigate our risk\npositions. Firmwide\nstress tests are\nperformed on a regular\nbasis and are designed\nto ensure a\ncomprehensive analysis\nof our vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic\nrisks combining\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, credit,\nmarket, liquidity and\nfunding, operational\nand compliance,\nstrategic, systemic\nand emerging risks\ninto our stress\nscenarios. We also\nperform ad hoc stress\ntests in anticipation\nof market events or\nconditions. Stress\ntests are also used to\nassess capital\nadequacy as part of\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess. See \u201cCapital\nManagement and\nRegulatory Capital \u2014\nCapital Management\u201d\nfor further\ninformation.\n\nWe maintain a daily\ndiscipline of marking\nsubstantially all of\nour inventory to\ncurrent market levels.\nWe carry our inventory\nat fair value, with\nchanges in valuation\nreflected immediately\nin our risk management\nsystems and in net\nrevenues. We do so\nbecause we believe\nthis discipline is one\nof the most effective\ntools for assessing\nand managing risk and\nthat it provides\ntransparent and\nrealistic insight into\nour inventory\nexposures.\n\n\u2022 Risk Appetite,\nLimits, Thresholds and\nAlerts. We apply risk\nlimits, thresholds and\nalerts to control and\nmonitor risk across\ntransactions,\nproducts, businesses\nand markets. The\nBoard, directly or\nindirectly through its\nRisk Committee,\napproves limits,\nthresholds and alerts\nincluded in our risk\nappetite statement at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels. In\naddition, the Firmwide\nRisk Appetite\nCommittee, through\ndelegated authority\nfrom the Firmwide\nEnterprise Risk\nCommittee, is\nresponsible for\napproving our risk\nlimits, thresholds and\nalerts policy, subject\nto the overall limits\ndirectly or indirectly\napproved by the Board,\nand monitoring these\nlimits.\n\nThe Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee is\nresponsible for\napproving and\nmonitoring limits at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels.\nCertain limits may be\nset at levels that\nwill require periodic\nadjustment, rather\nthan at levels that\nreflect our maximum\nrisk appetite. This\nfosters an ongoing\ndialogue about risk\namong our first and\nsecond lines of\ndefense, committees\nand senior management,\nas well as rapid\nescalation of risk-\nrelated matters. The\nFirmwide Risk Appetite\nCommittee also\nauthorizes Risk to set\nlimits and thresholds\nto support monitoring\nand oversight at a\nmore granular level.\nFor example, Market\nRisk sets limits at\ncertain product and\ndesk levels, and\nCredit Risk sets\nlimits for individual\ncounterparties and\ntheir subsidiaries,\nindustries and\ncountries. Limits are\nreviewed regularly and\namended on a permanent\nor temporary basis to\nreflect changes to our\nstrategic business\nplan, as well as\nchanging market\nconditions, business\nconditions or risk\ntolerance. Risks\nlimits are monitored\nby the respective Risk\nfunctions.\n                                      \n  96    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \n\u2022 Control Monitoring\nand Testing. We\nperform control\nmonitoring and testing\nto measure the\neffectiveness of our\nkey controls and to\nensure that we are in\ncompliance with\npolicies, codes of\nconduct, control\nstandards and\nregulatory\nrequirements.\nMonitoring and testing\nis performed by\ndedicated teams within\nthe first and second\nlines of defense.\nThese teams establish\nprocedures, develop\nrisk-based annual\nplans, perform control\ntesting and escalate\nidentified issues.\n\nIssues identified by\nthe dedicated teams,\nas well as self-\nidentified issues by\nour employees, are\nassessed for\nappropriate escalation\nand resolution. Where\nmaterial or thematic\nissues exist, we\ndevelop a plan to\nremediate them, as\nappropriate, and\nmonitor the\nremediation\nactivities.\n\n\u2022 Risk Reporting.\nEffective risk\nreporting depends on\nour ability to get the\nright information to\nthe right people at\nthe right time. Risk\nreporting is designed\nto be both forward-\nand backward-looking\nand consider detailed\ninformation on\nexisting and emerging\nrisk exposures. Risk\nreporting may include\nstress testing and\nscenario analysis,\ninformation about the\nrisk profiles for\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nutilization of risk\nlimits and thresholds,\ndetails of new and\nemerging risks\nidentified through our\nrisk identification\nprocesses, details of\nissues, significant\ninternal and external\nevents, and\ninformation related to\nthe effectiveness of\nour controls and\nremediation plans. As\nsuch, we focus on the\nrigor and\neffectiveness of our\nrisk systems, with the\nobjective of ensuring\nthat our risk\nmanagement technology\nsystems provide us\nwith complete,\naccurate and timely\ninformation. Our risk\nreporting process is\ndesigned to take into\naccount information\nabout both existing\nand emerging risks,\nthereby enabling our\nrisk committees and\nsenior management to\nperform their\nresponsibilities with\nthe appropriate level\nof insight into risk\nexposures.\n\nWe make extensive use\nof risk committees and\ncouncils that meet\nregularly and serve as\nan important means to\nfacilitate and foster\nongoing discussions to\nmanage and mitigate\nrisks.\n\nWe maintain strong and\nproactive\ncommunication about\nrisk and we have a\nculture of\ncollaboration in\ndecision-making among\nour first and second\nlines of defense,\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement. While our\nfirst line of defense\nis accountable and\nresponsible for\nmanagement of their\nrisk, we dedicate\nextensive resources to\nour second line of\ndefense in order to\nreinforce the\nimportance of having\neffective oversight\nand challenge, and a\nstrong culture of\nescalation and\naccountability across\nall functions.\n\nPeople. Even the best\ntechnology serves only\nas a tool for helping\nto make informed\ndecisions in real time\nabout the risks we are\ntaking. Ultimately,\neffective risk\nmanagement requires\nour people to\ninterpret our risk\ndata on an ongoing and\ntimely basis and\nadjust risk positions\naccordingly. The\nexperience of our\nprofessionals, and\ntheir understanding of\nthe nuances and\nlimitations of each\nrisk measure, guides\nus in assessing\nexposures and\nmaintaining them\nwithin prudent levels.\n\nWe reinforce a culture\nof effective risk\nmanagement, consistent\nwith our risk\nappetite, in our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nas well as in the way\nwe evaluate\nperformance, and\nrecognize and reward\nour people. Our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nincluding certain\nsessions led by our\nmost senior leaders,\nare focused on the\nimportance of risk\nmanagement, client\nrelationships and\nreputational\nexcellence. As part of\nour performance review\nprocess, we assess\nreputational\nexcellence, including\nhow an employee\nexercises good risk\nmanagement and\nreputational judgment,\nand adheres to our\ncode of conduct and\ncompliance policies.\nOur review and reward\nprocesses are designed\nto communicate and\nreinforce to our\nprofessionals the link\nbetween behavior and\nhow people are\nrecognized, the need\nto focus on our\nclients and our\nreputation, and the\nneed to always act in\naccordance with our\nhighest standards.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    97  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The Board\noversees risk both\ndirectly and through\nits committees,\nincluding its Risk\nCommittee. We also\nhave a series of\ncommittees that\ngenerally consist of\nsenior managers,\nincluding from both\nour first and second\nlines of defense, with\nspecific risk\nmanagement mandates\nthat have oversight or\ndecision-making\nresponsibilities for\nrisk management\nactivities. We have an\nestablished policy for\nthese committees so\nthat appropriate\ninformation barriers\nare in place. Our\nprimary risk\ncommittees, most of\nwhich also have\nadditional sub-\ncommittees, councils\nor working groups, are\ndescribed below. In\naddition to these\ncommittees, we have\nother risk committees\nthat provide oversight\nfor different\nbusinesses,\nactivities, products,\nregions and entities.\nAll of our committees\nhave responsibility\nfor considering the\nimpact on our\nreputation of the\ntransactions and\nactivities that they\noversee.\n\nMembership of our risk\ncommittees is reviewed\nregularly and updated\nto reflect changes in\nthe responsibilities\nof the committee\nmembers. Accordingly,\nthe length of time\nthat members serve on\nthe respective\ncommittees varies as\ndetermined by the\ncommittee chairs and\nbased on the\nresponsibilities of\nthe members.\n\nThe chart below\npresents an overview\nof our risk management\ngovernance structure.\n\nManagement Committee.\nThe Management\nCommittee oversees our\nglobal activities. It\nprovides this\noversight directly and\nthrough delegated\nauthority. This\ncommittee consists of\nour most senior\nleaders, and is\nchaired by our chief\nexecutive officer.\nMost members of the\nManagement Committee\nare also members of\nother committees. The\nfollowing are the\ncommittees that are\nprincipally involved\nin firmwide risk\nmanagement.\n\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee. The\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee is\nresponsible for\noverseeing all of our\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks. As\npart of such\noversight, the\ncommittee is\nresponsible for the\nongoing review,\napproval and\nmonitoring of our\nenterprise risk\nmanagement framework,\nas well as our risk\nlimits, and thresholds\nand alerts policy,\nthrough delegated\nauthority to the\nFirmwide Risk Appetite\nCommittee. The\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee also\nreviews new\nsignificant strategic\nbusiness initiatives\nto determine whether\nthey are consistent\nwith our risk appetite\nand risk management\ncapabilities.\nAdditionally, the\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee\nperforms enhanced\nreviews of significant\nrisk events, the top\nresidual and emerging\nrisks, and the overall\nrisk and control\nenvironment in each of\nour business units in\norder to propose\nuplifts, identify\nelements that are\ncommon to all business\nunits and analyze the\nconsolidated residual\nrisks that we face.\nThis committee, which\nreports to the\nManagement Committee,\nis co-chaired by our\npresident and chief\noperating officer and\nour chief risk\nofficer, who are\nappointed as chairs by\nour chief executive\nofficer, and the vice-\nchair is our chief\nfinancial officer, who\nis appointed as vice-\nchair by the chairs of\nthe Firmwide\nEnterprise Risk\nCommittee.

GCLA is\nliquidity that we\nmaintain to meet a\nbroad range of\npotential cash\noutflows and\ncollateral needs in a\nstressed environment.\nA primary liquidity\nprinciple is to pre-\nfund our estimated\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs\nduring a liquidity\ncrisis and hold this\nliquidity in the form\nof unencumbered,\nhighly liquid\nsecurities and cash.\nWe believe that the\nsecurities held in our\nGCLA would be readily\nconvertible to cash in\na matter of days,\nthrough liquidation,\nby entering into\nrepurchase agreements\nor from maturities of\nresale agreements, and\nthat this cash would\nallow us to meet\nimmediate obligations\nwithout needing to\nsell other assets or\ndepend on additional\nfunding from credit-\nsensitive markets.\n\nOur GCLA reflects the\nfollowing principles:\n\n\u2022 The first days or\nweeks of a liquidity\ncrisis are the most\ncritical to a\ncompany\u2019s survival;\n\n\u2022 Focus must be\nmaintained on all\npotential cash and\ncollateral outflows,\nnot just disruptions\nto financing flows.\nOur businesses are\ndiverse, and our\nliquidity needs are\ndetermined by many\nfactors, including\nmarket movements,\ncollateral\nrequirements and\nclient commitments,\nall of which can\nchange dramatically in\na difficult funding\nenvironment;\n\n\u2022 During a liquidity\ncrisis, credit-\nsensitive funding,\nincluding unsecured\ndebt, certain deposits\nand some types of\nsecured financing\nagreements, may be\nunavailable, and the\nterms (e.g., interest\nrates, collateral\nprovisions and tenor)\nor availability of\nother types of secured\nfinancing may change\nand certain deposits\nmay be withdrawn; and\n\n\u2022 As a result of our\npolicy to pre-fund\nliquidity that we\nestimate may be needed\nin a crisis, we hold\nmore unencumbered\nsecurities and have\nlarger funding\nbalances than our\nbusinesses would\notherwise require. We\nbelieve that our\nliquidity is stronger\nwith greater balances\nof highly liquid\nunencumbered\nsecurities, even\nthough it increases\nour total assets and\nour funding costs.\n\nWe maintain our GCLA\nacross Group Inc.,\nGoldman Sachs Funding\nLLC (Funding IHC) and\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries, asset\ntypes and clearing\nagents with the goal\nof providing us with\nsufficient operating\nliquidity to ensure\ntimely settlement in\nall major markets,\neven in a difficult\nfunding environment.\nIn addition to the\nGCLA, we maintain cash\nbalances and\nsecurities in several\nof our other entities,\nprimarily for use in\nspecific currencies,\nentities or\njurisdictions where we\ndo not have immediate\naccess to parent\ncompany liquidity.\n\nAsset-Liability\nManagement. Our\nliquidity risk\nmanagement policies\nare designed to ensure\nwe have a sufficient\namount of financing,\neven when funding\nmarkets experience\npersistent stress. We\nmanage the maturities\nand diversity of our\nfunding across\nmarkets, products and\ncounterparties, and\nseek to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nOur approach to asset-\nliability management\nincludes:\n\n\u2022 Conservatively\nmanaging the overall\ncharacteristics of our\nfunding book, with a\nfocus on maintaining\nlong-term, diversified\nsources of funding in\nexcess of our current\nrequirements. See\n\u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nFunding Sources\u201d for\nfurther information;\n\n\u2022 Actively managing\nand monitoring our\nasset base, with\nparticular focus on\nthe liquidity, holding\nperiod and ability to\nfund assets on a\nsecured basis. We\nassess our funding\nrequirements and our\nability to liquidate\nassets in a stressed\nenvironment while\nappropriately managing\nrisk. This enables us\nto determine the most\nappropriate funding\nproducts and tenors.\nSee \u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nBalance Sheet\nManagement\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our balance\nsheet management\nprocess and \u201c\u2014 Funding\nSources \u2014 Secured\nFunding\u201d for further\ninformation about\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis; and\n\n\u2022 Raising secured and\nunsecured financing\nthat has a long tenor\nrelative to the\nliquidity profile of\nour assets. This\nreduces the risk that\nour liabilities will\ncome due in advance of\nour ability to\ngenerate liquidity\nfrom the sale of our\nassets. Because we\nmaintain a highly\nliquid balance sheet,\nthe holding period of\ncertain of our assets\nmay be materially\nshorter than their\ncontractual maturity\ndates.\n\nOur goal is to ensure\nthat we maintain\nsufficient liquidity\nto fund our assets and\nmeet our contractual\nand contingent\nobligations in normal\ntimes, as well as\nduring periods of\nmarket stress. Through\nour dynamic balance\nsheet management\nprocess, we use actual\nand projected asset\nbalances to determine\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding requirements.\nFunding plans are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee.\nIn addition, Risk and\nthe Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee\nreview our total\nunsecured long-term\nborrowings and total\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nto help ensure that we\nmaintain a level of\nlong-term funding that\nis sufficient to meet\nour long-term\nfinancing\nrequirements. In a\nliquidity crisis, we\nwould begin by\nliquidating and\nmonetizing our GCLA\nbefore selling other\nassets. However, we\nrecognize that orderly\nasset sales may be\nprudent or necessary\nin a severe or\npersistent liquidity\ncrisis.\n                                       \n  100    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In\naddition, Group Inc.\nprovides its regulated\nsubsidiaries with the\nnecessary capital to\nmeet their regulatory\nrequirements. The\nbenefits of this\napproach to subsidiary\nfunding are enhanced\ncontrol and greater\nflexibility to meet\nthe funding\nrequirements of our\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nis also raised at the\nsubsidiary level\nthrough a variety of\nproducts, including\ndeposits, secured\nfunding and unsecured\nborrowings.\n\nOur intercompany\nfunding policies\nassume that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s funds or\nsecurities are not\nfreely available to\nits parent, Funding\nIHC or other\nsubsidiaries unless\n(i) legally provided\nfor and (ii) there are\nno additional\nregulatory, tax or\nother restrictions. In\nparticular, many of\nour subsidiaries are\nsubject to laws that\nauthorize regulatory\nbodies to block or\nreduce the flow of\nfunds from those\nsubsidiaries to Group\nInc. or Funding IHC.\nRegulatory action of\nthat kind could impede\naccess to funds that\nGroup Inc. needs to\nmake payments on its\nobligations.\nAccordingly, we assume\nthat the capital\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or other\nsubsidiaries and any\nother financing\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or Funding\nIHC until the maturity\nof such financing.\n\nGroup Inc. has\nprovided substantial\namounts of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness, directly\nor indirectly, to its\nregulated\nsubsidiaries. For\nexample, as of\nDecember 2024, Group\nInc. had $38.69\nbillion of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness invested\nin GS&Co., its\nprincipal U.S.\nregistered broker-\ndealer; $47.21 billion\ninvested in GSI, a\nregulated U.K. broker-\ndealer; $2.08 billion\ninvested in GSJCL, a\nregulated Japanese\nbroker-dealer; $62.81\nbillion invested in GS\nBank USA, a regulated\nNew York State-\nchartered bank; and\n$5.30 billion invested\nin GSIB, a regulated\nU.K. bank. Group Inc.\nalso provides\nfinancing, directly or\nindirectly, in the\nform of: $131.82\nbillion of\nunsubordinated loans\n(including secured\nloans of $59.97\nbillion) and $32.92\nbillion of collateral\nand cash deposits to\nthese entities as of\nDecember 2024. In\naddition, as of\nDecember 2024, Group\nInc. had significant\namounts of capital\ninvested in and loans\nto its other regulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nContingency Funding\nPlan. We maintain a\ncontingency funding\nplan to provide a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nliquidity crisis\nsituation or periods\nof market stress. Our\ncontingency funding\nplan outlines a list\nof potential risk\nfactors, key reports\nand metrics that are\nreviewed on an ongoing\nbasis to assist in\nassessing the severity\nof, and managing\nthrough, a liquidity\ncrisis and/or market\ndislocation. The\ncontingency funding\nplan also describes in\ndetail our potential\nresponses if our\nassessments indicate\nthat we have entered a\nliquidity crisis,\nwhich include pre-\nfunding for what we\nestimate will be our\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs, as\nwell as utilizing\nsecondary sources of\nliquidity. Mitigants\nand action items to\naddress specific risks\nwhich may arise are\nalso described and\nassigned to\nindividuals\nresponsible for\nexecution.\n\nThe contingency\nfunding plan\nidentifies key groups\nof individuals and\ntheir\nresponsibilities,\nwhich include\nfostering effective\ncoordination, control\nand distribution of\ninformation,\nimplementing liquidity\nmaintenance activities\nand managing internal\nand external\ncommunication, all of\nwhich are critical in\nthe management of a\ncrisis or period of\nmarket stress.\nStress Tests\nIn order to determine\nthe appropriate size\nof our GCLA, we model\nliquidity outflows\nover a range of\nscenarios and time\nhorizons. One of our\nprimary internal\nliquidity risk models,\nreferred to as the\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow, quantifies\nour liquidity risks\nover a 30-day stress\nscenario. We also\nconsider other\nfactors, including,\nbut not limited to, an\nassessment of our\npotential intraday\nliquidity needs\nthrough an additional\ninternal liquidity\nrisk model, referred\nto as the Intraday\nLiquidity Model, the\nresults of our long-\nterm stress testing\nmodels, our resolution\nliquidity models and\nother applicable\nregulatory\nrequirements and a\nqualitative assessment\nof our condition, as\nwell as the financial\nmarkets. The results\nof the Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow, the\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel, the long-term\nstress testing models\nand the resolution\nliquidity models are\nreported to senior\nmanagement on a\nregular basis.

Our Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow is\nbased on conducting\nmultiple scenarios\nthat include\ncombinations of\nmarket-wide and firm-\nspecific stress. These\nscenarios are\ncharacterized by the\nfollowing qualitative\nelements:\n\n\u2022 Severely challenged\nmarket environments,\nwhich include low\nconsumer and corporate\nconfidence, financial\nand political\ninstability, and\nadverse changes in\nmarket values,\nincluding potential\ndeclines in equity\nmarkets and widening\nof credit spreads; and\n\n\u2022 A firm-specific\ncrisis potentially\ntriggered by material\nlosses, reputational\ndamage (including, as\na result of, the\ndissemination of\nnegative information\nthrough social media),\nlitigation and/or a\nratings downgrade.\n\nThe following are key\nmodeling elements of\nour Modeled Liquidity\nOutflow:\n\n\u2022 Liquidity needs over\na 30-day scenario;\n\n\u2022 A two-notch\ndowngrade of our long-\nterm senior unsecured\ncredit ratings;\n\n\u2022 Changing conditions\nin funding markets,\nwhich limit our access\nto unsecured and\nsecured funding;\n\n\u2022 No support from\nadditional government\nfunding facilities.\nAlthough we have\naccess to various\ncentral bank funding\nprograms, we do not\nassume reliance on\nadditional sources of\nfunding in a liquidity\ncrisis; and\n\n\u2022 A combination of\ncontractual outflows\nand contingent\noutflows arising from\nboth our on- and off-\nbalance sheet\narrangements.\nContractual outflows\ninclude, among other\nthings, upcoming\nmaturities of\nunsecured debt, term\ndeposits and secured\nfunding. Contingent\noutflows include,\namong other things,\nthe withdrawal of\ncustomer credit\nbalances in our prime\nbrokerage business,\nincrease in variation\nmargin requirements\ndue to adverse changes\nin the value of our\nexchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared\nderivatives, draws on\nunfunded commitments\nand withdrawals of\ndeposits that have no\ncontractual maturity.\nSee notes to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\ncontractual outflows,\nincluding Note 11 for\ncollateralized\nfinancings, Note 13\nfor deposits, Note 14\nfor unsecured long-\nterm borrowings and\nNote 15 for operating\nlease payments, and\n\u201cOff-Balance Sheet\nArrangements\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our various\ntypes of off-balance\nsheet arrangements.\n\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel. Our Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nmeasures our intraday\nliquidity needs in a\nscenario where access\nto sources of intraday\nliquidity may become\nconstrained. The\nintraday liquidity\nmodel considers a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding historical\nsettlement activity.\n\nLong-Term Stress\nTesting. We utilize\nlonger-term stress\ntests to take a\nforward view on our\nliquidity position\nthrough prolonged\nstress periods in\nwhich we experience a\nsevere liquidity\nstress and recover in\nan environment that\ncontinues to be\nchallenging. We are\nfocused on ensuring\nconservative asset-\nliability management\nto prepare for a\nprolonged period of\npotential stress,\nseeking to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nResolution Liquidity\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established our\nResolution Liquidity\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich estimates\nliquidity needs of our\nmajor subsidiaries in\na stressed\nenvironment. The\nliquidity needs are\nmeasured using our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow assumptions\nand include certain\nadditional inter-\naffiliate exposures.\nWe have also\nestablished our\nResolution Liquidity\nExecution Need\nframework, which\nmeasures the liquidity\nneeds of our major\nsubsidiaries to\nstabilize and wind\ndown following a Group\nInc. bankruptcy filing\nin accordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIn addition, we have\nestablished a triggers\nand alerts framework,\nwhich is designed to\nprovide the Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc.\n                                              \n  Limits                                      \n                                              \nWe use liquidity risk\nlimits at various\nlevels and across\nliquidity risk types\nto manage the size of\nour liquidity\nexposures. Limits are\nmeasured relative to\nacceptable levels of\nrisk given our\nliquidity risk\ntolerance.

Inherent\nlimitations to VaR\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 VaR does not\nestimate potential\nlosses over longer\ntime horizons where\nmoves may be extreme;\n\n\u2022 VaR does not take\naccount of the\nrelative liquidity of\ndifferent risk\npositions; and\n\n\u2022 Previous moves in\nmarket risk factors\nmay not produce\naccurate predictions\nof all future market\nmoves.\n\nTo comprehensively\ncapture our exposures\nand relevant risks in\nour VaR calculation,\nwe use historical\nsimulations with full\nvaluation of market\nfactors at the\nposition level by\nsimultaneously\nshocking the relevant\nmarket factors for\nthat position. These\nmarket factors include\nspot prices, credit\nspreads, funding\nspreads, yield curves,\nvolatility and\ncorrelation, and are\nupdated periodically\nbased on changes in\nthe composition of\npositions, as well as\nvariations in market\nconditions. We sample\nfrom five years of\nhistorical data to\ngenerate the scenarios\nfor our VaR\ncalculation. The\nhistorical data is\nweighted so that the\nrelative importance of\nthe data reduces over\ntime. This gives\ngreater importance to\nmore recent\nobservations and\nreflects current asset\nvolatilities, which\nimproves the accuracy\nof our estimates of\npotential loss. As a\nresult, even if our\npositions included in\nVaR were unchanged,\nour VaR would increase\nwith increasing market\nvolatility and vice\nversa.\n\nGiven its reliance on\nhistorical data, VaR\nis most effective in\nestimating risk\nexposures in markets\nin which there are no\nsudden fundamental\nchanges or shifts in\nmarket conditions.\n\nOur VaR measure does\nnot include:\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nnot accounted for at\nfair value, such as\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities and loans,\ndeposits and unsecured\nborrowings that are\naccounted for at\namortized cost;\n\n\u2022 Available-for-sale\nsecurities for which\nthe related unrealized\nfair value gains and\nlosses are included in\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss);\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nbest measured and\nmonitored using\nsensitivity measures;\nand\n\n\u2022 The impact of\nchanges in\ncounterparty and our\nown credit spreads on\nderivatives, as well\nas changes in our own\ncredit spreads on\nfinancial liabilities\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected.\n\nWe perform daily\nbacktesting of our VaR\nmodel (i.e., comparing\ndaily net revenues for\npositions included in\nVaR to the VaR measure\ncalculated as of the\nprior business day) at\nthe firmwide level and\nfor each of our\nbusinesses and major\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nEarnings-at-Risk. We\nmanage our interest\nrate risk using the\nEaR metric. EaR\nmeasures the estimated\nimpact of changes in\ninterest rates to our\nnet revenues and\npreferred stock\ndividends over a\ndefined time horizon.\nEaR complements the\nVaR metric, which\nmeasures the impact of\ninterest rate changes\nthat have an immediate\nimpact on the fair\nvalues of our assets\nand liabilities (i.e.,\nmark-to-market\nchanges). Our exposure\nto interest rate risk\noccurs due to a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to:\n\n\u2022 Differences in\nmaturity or repricing\ndates of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock and certain off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments.\n\n\u2022 Differences in the\namounts of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock and certain off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments with the\nsame maturity or\nrepricing dates.\n\n\u2022 Certain interest\nrate sensitive fees.\n\nCorporate Treasury\nmanages the aggregated\ninterest rate risk\nfrom all businesses\nusing both cash and\nderivatives\ninstruments, including\navailable-for-sale and\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities and\ninterest rate\nderivatives. We\nmeasure EaR over a\none-year time horizon\nfollowing a 100- and\n200-basis point\ninstantaneous parallel\nshock in both short-\nand long-term interest\nrates. This\nsensitivity is\ncalculated relative to\na baseline market\nscenario, which takes\ninto consideration,\namong other things,\nthe market\u2019s\nexpectation of forward\nrates, as well as our\nexpectation of future\nbusiness activity.\nThese scenarios\ninclude contractual\nelements of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock, and certain\noff-balance sheet\ninstruments, such as\nrates of interest,\nprincipal repayment\nschedules, maturity\nand reset dates, and\nany interest rate\nceilings or floors, as\nwell as assumptions\nwith respect to our\nbalance sheet size and\ncomposition,\nprepayment behavior\nand deposit repricing.\nDeposit repricing is\ncaptured by evaluating\nthe change in deposit\nrate paid relative to\nthe change in market\nrates (deposit beta)\nand we calibrate the\ndeposit betas used in\nour models by using a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding observed\nhistorical behavior,\nfuture expectations,\nfunding needs and the\ncompetitive landscape.\nWe continuously\nmonitor the\nperformance of our key\nassumptions against\nobserved behavior and\nregularly review their\nsensitivity on our\nrisk metrics.\n\nWe manage EaR with a\ngoal to reduce\npotential volatility\nresulting from changes\nin interest rates so\nit remains within our\nEaR risk appetite. Our\nEaR scenario is\nregularly evaluated\nand updated, if\nnecessary, to reflect\nchanges in our\nbusiness plans, market\nconditions and other\nmacroeconomic factors.\nWhile management uses\nthe best information\navailable to estimate\nEaR, actual results\nmay differ materially\nas a result of, among\nother things, changes\nin the economic\nenvironment or\nassumptions used in\nthe process. We also\nmeasure the\nsensitivity of the\neconomic value of our\nequity (EVE) to\nchanges in interest\nrates. Compared to\nEaR, EVE provides a\nlonger-term\nmeasurement of the\ninterest rate risk\nexposure, primarily on\nnon-trading assets and\nliabilities, by\ncapturing the net\nimpact of changes in\ninterest rates to the\npresent value of their\ncash flows.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    107  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Risk,\nwhich is part of our\nsecond line of defense\nand reports to our\nchief risk officer,\nhas primary\nresponsibility for\nassessing, monitoring\nand managing our\ninterest rate risk\n(including EaR and EVE\nsensitivity) by\nproviding independent\nfirmwide oversight and\nchallenge across our\nglobal businesses.\nStress Testing. Stress\ntesting is a method of\ndetermining the effect\nof various\nhypothetical stress\nscenarios. We use\nstress tests to\nexamine risks of\nspecific portfolios,\nas well as the\npotential impact of\nour significant risk\nexposures. We use a\nvariety of stress\ntesting techniques to\ncalculate the\npotential loss from a\nwide range of market\nmoves on our\nportfolios, including\nfirmwide stress tests,\nsensitivity analysis\nand scenario analysis.\nThe results of our\nvarious stress tests\nare analyzed together\nfor risk management\npurposes. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\nSensitivity analysis\nis used to quantify\nthe impact of a market\nmove in a single risk\nfactor across all\npositions (e.g.,\nequity prices or\ncredit spreads) using\na variety of defined\nmarket shocks, ranging\nfrom those that could\nbe expected over a\none-day time horizon\nup to those that could\ntake many months to\noccur. We also use\nsensitivity analysis\nto quantify the impact\nof the default of any\nsingle entity, which\ncaptures the risk of\nlarge or concentrated\nexposures. Scenario\nanalysis is used to\nquantify the impact of\na specified event,\nincluding how the\nevent impacts multiple\nrisk factors\nsimultaneously. For\nexample, for sovereign\nstress testing we\ncalculate potential\ndirect exposure\nassociated with our\nsovereign positions,\nas well as the\ncorresponding debt,\nequity and currency\nexposures associated\nwith our non-sovereign\npositions that may be\nimpacted by the\nsovereign distress.\nWhen conducting\nscenario analysis, we\noften consider a\nnumber of possible\noutcomes for each\nscenario, ranging from\nmoderate to severely\nadverse market\nimpacts. In addition,\nthese stress tests are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical events and\nforward-looking\nhypothetical\nscenarios. Unlike VaR\nmeasures, which have\nan implied probability\nbecause they are\ncalculated at a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, there may not\nbe an implied\nprobability that our\nstress testing\nscenarios will occur.\nInstead, stress\ntesting is used to\nmodel both moderate\nand more extreme moves\nin underlying market\nfactors. When\nestimating potential\nloss, we generally\nassume that our\npositions cannot be\nreduced or hedged\n(although experience\ndemonstrates that we\nare generally able to\ndo so).\n\nLimits We use market\nrisk limits at various\nlevels to manage the\nsize of our market\nexposures. These\nlimits are set based\non VaR, EaR and on a\nrange of stress tests\nrelevant to our\nexposures. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess. Limits are\nmonitored by Corporate\nTreasury and Risk.\nRisk is responsible\nfor identifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded (e.g., due to\npositional changes or\nchanges in market\nconditions, such as\nincreased volatilities\nor changes in\ncorrelations). Such\ninstances are\nremediated by a\nreduction in the\npositions we hold\nand/or a temporary or\npermanent increase to\nthe limit, if\nwarranted. Metrics We\nanalyze VaR at the\nfirmwide level and a\nvariety of more\ndetailed levels,\nincluding by risk\ncategory, business and\nregion.\nDiversification effect\nin the tables below\nrepresents the\ndifference between\ntotal VaR and the sum\nof the VaRs for the\nfour risk categories.\nThis effect arises\nbecause the four\nmarket risk categories\nare not perfectly\ncorrelated.\nSubstantially all\npositions in VaR are\nincluded within Global\nBanking & Markets.

Credit Risk Management Overview Credit\nrisk represents the potential for loss due to\nthe default or deterioration in credit quality\nof a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives\ncounterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of\nsecurities or other instruments we hold. Our\nexposure to credit risk comes mostly from\nclient transactions in OTC derivatives and\nloans and lending commitments. Credit risk\nalso comes from cash placed with banks,\nsecurities financing transactions (i.e.,\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending activities)\nand customer and other receivables.\n\nCredit Risk, which is part of our second line\nof defense and reports to our chief risk\nofficer, has primary responsibility for\nassessing, monitoring and managing our credit\nrisk by providing independent firmwide\noversight and challenge across our global\nbusinesses. In addition, we hold other\npositions that give rise to credit risk (e.g.,\nbonds and secondary bank loans). These credit\nrisks are captured as a component of market\nrisk measures, which are monitored and managed\nby Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives\nto manage market risk exposures. Such\nderivatives also give rise to credit risk,\nwhich is monitored and managed by Credit Risk.\nCredit Risk Management Process Our process for\nmanaging credit risk includes the critical\ncomponents of our risk management framework\ndescribed in the \u201cOverview and Structure of\nRisk Management,\u201d as well as the following: \u2022\nMonitoring compliance with established credit\nrisk limits and reporting our credit exposures\nand credit concentrations; \u2022 Establishing or\napproving underwriting standards; \u2022 Assessing\nthe likelihood that a counterparty will\ndefault on its payment obligations; \u2022\nMeasuring our current and potential credit\nexposure and losses resulting from a\ncounterparty default; \u2022 Using credit risk\nmitigants, including collateral and hedging;\nand \u2022 Maximizing recovery through active\nworkout and restructuring of claims. We also\nperform credit analyses, which incorporate\ninitial and ongoing evaluations of the\ncapacity and willingness of a counterparty to\nmeet its financial obligations. For\nsubstantially all of our credit exposures, the\ncore of our process is an annual counterparty\ncredit evaluation or more frequently if deemed\nnecessary as a result of events or changes in\ncircumstances. We determine an internal credit\nrating for the counterparty by considering the\nresults of the credit evaluations and\nassumptions with respect to the nature of and\noutlook for the counterparty\u2019s industry and\nthe economic environment. For collateralized\nloans, we also take into consideration\ncollateral received or other credit support\narrangements when determining an internal\ncredit rating. Senior personnel, with\nexpertise in specific industries, inspect and\napprove credit reviews and internal credit\nratings. Our risk assessment process may also\ninclude, where applicable, reviewing certain\nkey metrics, including, but not limited to,\ndelinquency status, collateral value, FICO\ncredit scores and other risk factors.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    111  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These shocks\ncover a wide range of\nmoderate and more\nextreme market\nmovements, including\nshocks to multiple\nrisk factors,\nconsistent with the\noccurrence of a severe\nmarket or economic\nevent. In the case of\nsovereign default, we\nestimate the direct\nimpact of the default\non our sovereign\ncredit exposures,\nchanges to our credit\nexposures arising from\npotential market moves\nin response to the\ndefault, and the\nimpact of credit\nmarket deterioration\non corporate borrowers\nand counterparties\nthat may result from\nthe sovereign default.\nUnlike potential\nexposure, which is\ncalculated within a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, stress testing\ndoes not generally\nassume a probability\nof these events\noccurring. We also\nperform firmwide\nstress tests. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\n\nTo supplement these\nregular stress tests,\nas described above, we\nalso conduct tailored\nstress tests on an ad\nhoc basis in response\nto specific events\nthat we deem\nsignificant.

The\nparameters of these\nshocks vary based on\nthe scenario reflected\nin each stress test.\nWe review estimated\nlosses produced by the\nstress tests in order\nto understand their\nmagnitude, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations, and\nassess and seek to\nmitigate our\nexposures, where\nnecessary.\n                                              \n  Limits                                      \n                                              \nWe use credit risk\nlimits at various\nlevels, as well as\nunderwriting standards\nto manage the size and\nnature of our credit\nexposures.

The\ntype and structure of\nrisk mitigants\nemployed can\nsignificantly\ninfluence the degree\nof credit risk\ninvolved in a loan or\nlending commitment.\n\nWhen we do not have\nsufficient visibility\ninto a counterparty\u2019s\nfinancial strength or\nwhen we believe a\ncounterparty requires\nsupport from its\nparent, we may obtain\nthird-party guarantees\nof the counterparty\u2019s\nobligations. We may\nalso seek to mitigate\nour credit risk using\ncredit derivatives or\nparticipation\nagreements.\n                                       \n  112    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\npercentage of our\ncredit exposures\narising from non-\ninvestment-grade\ncounterparties (based\non our internally\ndetermined public\nrating agency\nequivalents) increased\ncompared with December\n2023, primarily\nreflecting a decrease\nin investment-grade\ncredit exposure\nrelated to cash\ndeposits with central\nbanks.

OTC Derivatives.\nOur credit exposure on\nOTC derivatives arises\nprimarily from our\nmarket-making\nactivities. As a\nmarket maker, we enter\ninto derivative\ntransactions to\nprovide liquidity to\nclients and to\nfacilitate the\ntransfer and hedging\nof their risks. We\nalso enter into\nderivatives to manage\nmarket risk exposures.\nWe manage our credit\nexposure on OTC\nderivatives using the\ncredit risk process,\nmeasures, limits and\nrisk mitigants\ndescribed above.\n\nWe generally enter\ninto OTC derivatives\ntransactions under\nbilateral collateral\narrangements that\nrequire the daily\nexchange of\ncollateral. As credit\nrisk is an essential\ncomponent of fair\nvalue, we include a\ncredit valuation\nadjustment (CVA) in\nthe fair value of\nderivatives to reflect\ncounterparty credit\nrisk, as described in\nNote 7 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements.

These\nreceivables generally\nhave minimal credit\nrisk due to the low\nprobability of\nclearing organization\ndefault and the short-\nterm nature of\nreceivables related to\nsecurities\nsettlements.\nReceivables from\ncustomers and\ncounterparties\ngenerally consist of\ncollateralized\nreceivables related to\ncustomer securities\ntransactions and\ngenerally have minimal\ncredit risk due to\nboth the value of the\ncollateral received\nand the short-term\nnature of these\nreceivables.

In conjunction with third-\nparty vendors and consultants, we perform risk\nassessments to gauge the performance of the\nCybersecurity Program, to estimate our risk\nprofile and to assess compliance with relevant\nregulatory requirements. We perform periodic\nassessments of control efficacy through our\ninternal risk and control self-assessment\nprocess, as well as a variety of external\ntechnical assessments, including external\npenetration tests and \u201cred team\u201d engagements\nwhere third parties test our defenses. The\nresults of these risk assessments, together\nwith control performance findings, are used to\nestablish priorities, allocate resources, and\nidentify and improve controls. We use third\nparties, such as outside forensics firms, to\naugment our cyber incident response\ncapabilities. We have a vendor management\nprogram that documents a risk-based framework\nfor managing third-party vendor relationships.\nInformation security risk management is built\ninto our vendor management process, which\ncovers vendor selection, onboarding,\nperformance monitoring and risk management.\nSee \u201cThird-Party Risk\u201d for further information\nabout vendor risk.\n                                       \n  122    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Accordingly, we\nhave in place a\ncomprehensive capital\nmanagement policy that\nprovides a framework,\ndefines objectives and\nestablishes guidelines\nto maintain an\nappropriate level and\ncomposition of capital\nin both business-as-\nusual and stressed\nconditions. Our\ncapital management\nframework is designed\nto provide us with the\ninformation needed to\nidentify and\ncomprehensively manage\nrisk, and develop and\napply projected stress\nscenarios that capture\nidiosyncratic\nvulnerabilities with a\ngoal of holding\nsufficient capital to\nremain adequately\ncapitalized even after\nexperiencing a severe\nstress event. See\n\u201cCapital Management\nand Regulatory\nCapital\u201d for further\ninformation about our\ncapital management\nprocess.\n\nWe have established a\ncomprehensive\ngovernance structure\nto manage and oversee\nour day-to-day capital\nmanagement activities\nand to ensure\ncompliance with\ncapital rules and\nrelated policies. Our\ncapital management\nactivities are\noverseen by the Board\nand its committees.\nThe Board is\nresponsible for\napproving our annual\ncapital plan and the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard approves our\ncapital management\npolicy, which details\nthe risk committees\nand members of senior\nmanagement who are\nresponsible for the\nongoing monitoring of\nour capital adequacy\nand evaluation of\ncurrent and future\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, the\nreview of the results\nof our capital\nplanning and stress\ntests processes, and\nthe results of our\ncapital models. In\naddition, our risk\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement are\nresponsible for the\nreview of our\ncontingency capital\nplan, key capital\nadequacy metrics,\nincluding regulatory\ncapital ratios, and\ncapital plan metrics,\nsuch as the payout\nratio, as well as\nmonitoring capital\ntargets and potential\nbreaches of capital\nrequirements.\n\nOur process for\nmanaging capital risk\nalso includes\nindependent oversight\nby Risk that assesses\nour capital management\nframework, regulatory\ncapital policies and\nrelated\ninterpretations and\nescalates certain\ninterpretations to\nsenior management\nand/or the appropriate\nrisk committee. This\noversight includes,\namong other things,\nindependent review and\nchallenge of our\ncapital ratio targets,\nplanned capital\nactions and regulatory\ncapital calculations;\nanalysis of the\nrelated documentation;\nindependent testing;\nand an assessment of\nthe appropriateness of\nthe calculations and\ntheir alignment with\nthe relevant\nregulatory capital\nrules.\nClimate-Related and\nEnvironmental Risk\nManagement\nWe categorize climate-\nrelated and\nenvironmental risks\ninto physical risk and\ntransition risk.\nPhysical risk is the\nrisk that asset values\nmay decline or\noperations may be\ndisrupted as a result\nof changes in the\nclimate, while\ntransition risk is the\nrisk that asset values\nmay decline because of\nchanges in climate\npolicies or changes in\nthe underlying economy\ndue to\ndecarbonization.\n\nClimate-related and\nenvironmental risks\nmanifest in different\nways across our\nbusinesses. We have\ncontinued to make\nsignificant\nenhancements to our\nclimate risk\nmanagement framework,\nincluding steps to\nfurther integrate\nclimate risk into our\nbroader risk\nmanagement processes.\nWe have integrated\noversight of climate-\nrelated risks into our\nrisk management\ngovernance structure,\nfrom senior management\nto our Board and its\ncommittees, including\nthe Risk and Public\nResponsibilities\ncommittees. The Risk\nCommittee of the Board\noversees firmwide\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nwhich include climate\nrisk, and, as part of\nits oversight,\nreceives updates on\nour risk management\napproach to climate\nrisk, including our\napproaches towards\nscenario analysis and\nintegration into\nexisting risk\nmanagement processes.\nThe Public\nResponsibilities\nCommittee of the Board\nassists the Board in\nits oversight of our\nfirmwide\nsustainability\nstrategy and\nsustainability issues\naffecting us,\nincluding with respect\nto climate change. As\npart of its oversight,\nthe Public\nResponsibilities\nCommittee receives\nperiodic updates on\nour sustainability\nstrategy and\ndisclosures, and also\nperiodically reviews\nour governance and\nrelated policies and\nprocesses for climate\nand other\nsustainability-related\nmatters. Senior\nmanagement within\nRisk, in coordination\nwith senior management\nin our revenue-\nproducing units, is\nresponsible for the\ndevelopment of the\nclimate-related and\nenvironmental risk\nprogram. The objective\nof this program is to\nintegrate climate-\nrelated and\nenvironmental risks\ninto existing risk\ndisciplines and\nbusiness\nconsiderations, such\nas the integration of\nclimate risk into our\ncredit evaluation and\nunderwriting processes\nfor select industries.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    125  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Our\nCompliance Risk\nManagement Program,\nadministered by\nCompliance, assesses\nour compliance,\nregulatory and\nreputational risk;\nmonitors for\ncompliance with new or\namended laws, rules\nand regulations;\ndesigns and implements\ncontrols, policies,\nprocedures and\ntraining; conducts\nindependent testing;\ninvestigates, surveils\nand monitors for\ncompliance risks and\nbreaches; and leads\nour responses to\nregulatory\nexaminations, audits\nand inquiries. We\nmonitor and review\nbusiness practices to\nassess whether they\nmeet or exceed minimum\nregulatory and legal\nstandards in all\nmarkets and\njurisdictions in which\nwe conduct business.\nConflicts Management\nConflicts of interest\nand our approach to\ndealing with them are\nfundamental to our\nclient relationships,\nour reputation and our\nlong-term success. The\nterm \u201cconflict of\ninterest\u201d does not\nhave a universally\naccepted meaning, and\nconflicts can arise in\nmany forms within a\nbusiness or between\nbusinesses. The\nresponsibility for\nidentifying potential\nconflicts, as well as\ncomplying with our\npolicies and\nprocedures, is shared\nby all of our\nemployees.\n\nWe have a multilayered\napproach to resolving\nconflicts and\naddressing\nreputational risk. Our\nsenior management\noversees policies\nrelated to conflicts\nresolution and, in\nconjunction with\nConflicts Resolution,\nLegal and Compliance,\nand internal\ncommittees, formulates\npolicies, standards\nand principles, and\nassists in making\njudgments regarding\nthe appropriate\nresolution of\nparticular conflicts.\nResolving potential\nconflicts necessarily\ndepends on the facts\nand circumstances of a\nparticular situation\nand the application of\nexperienced and\ninformed judgment.\n\nAs a general matter,\nConflicts Resolution\nreviews financing and\nadvisory assignments\nin Global Banking &\nMarkets and certain of\nour investing, lending\nand other activities.\nIn addition, we have\nvarious transaction\noversight committees\nthat also review new\nunderwritings, loans,\ninvestments and\nstructured products.\nThese groups and\ncommittees work with\ninternal and external\ncounsel and Compliance\nto evaluate and\naddress any actual or\npotential conflicts.\nThe head of Conflicts\nResolution reports to\nour chief legal\nofficer, who reports\nto our chief executive\nofficer.\n\nWe regularly assess\nour policies and\nprocedures that\naddress conflicts of\ninterest in an effort\nto conduct our\nbusiness in accordance\nwith the highest\nethical standards and\nin compliance with all\napplicable laws, rules\nand regulations.\n                                              \n  Reputational Risk Management                \n                                              \nReputational risk is\nthe potential risk\nthat negative\npublicity regarding\nour business\npractices, whether\ntrue or not, will\ncause a decline in our\ncustomer base, costly\nlitigation or revenue\nreductions. Our\nreputation is critical\nto effectively serving\nour clients and\nfostering and\nmaintaining long-term\nclient relationships,\nand it is integral to\nhow we are viewed by\nour key stakeholders.\n\nIn evaluating business\nopportunities,\nreputational risk is\none of the most\nsignificant components\nwe consider. We\nevaluate the ethics,\nsuitability and\ntransparency of\ntransactions\nundertaken by us. Our\nemployees are\nresponsible for\nconsidering the\nreputational impacts\nthat our business\nactivities may have.\n\nWe have implemented a\ncomprehensive program\ndesigned to monitor\nreputational risk. The\nFirmwide Reputational\nRisk Committee, which\nreports into the\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee, is\nresponsible for\nassessing reputational\nrisks arising from\nbusiness opportunities\nthat have been\nidentified as having\npotential heightened\nreputational risk.\nThis committee is also\nresponsible for\noverseeing client-\nrelated business\nstandards and\naddressing client-\nrelated reputational\nrisk and considers,\namong other things,\nthe potential effects\nany business\nopportunities,\nproducts,\ntransactions, new\nactivities,\nacquisitions,\ndispositions or\ninvestments could have\non our reputation.\n\nFor further\ninformation about our\nrisk management\nprocesses, see\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d in Part I,\nItem 1A of this Form\n10-K.\n                                       \n  126    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nConsolidation The firm consolidates entities\nin which the firm has a controlling financial\ninterest. The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a\nvoting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)\nthe total equity investment at risk is\nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity\nholders have the power to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the\nentity and the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting\ninterest entity is ownership of a majority\nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest\nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable\nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that\nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a\nvoting interest entity. The firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when\nthe firm has a variable interest or interests\nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive\nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for\nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method\nInvestments. When the firm does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity\nbut can exert significant influence over the\nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair\nvalue by electing the fair value option\navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant\ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns\n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstance common stock. In certain cases, the\nfirm applies the equity method of accounting\nto new investments that are strategic in\nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s\nprincipal business activities, when the firm\nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or\nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less\nsignificant. See Note 8 for further\ninformation about equity-method investments.\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed\ninvestment funds with third-party investors.\nThese funds are typically organized as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies\nfor which the firm acts as general partner or\nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a\nmajority of the economic interests in these\nfunds. These funds are usually voting interest\nentities and generally are not consolidated\nbecause third-party investors typically have\nrights to terminate the funds or to remove the\nfirm as general partner or manager.\nInvestments in these funds are generally\nmeasured at net asset value (NAV) and are\nincluded in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and\n22 for further information about investments\nin funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of\nthese consolidated financial statements\nrequires management to make certain estimates\nand assumptions, the most important of which\nrelate to fair value measurements, the\nallowance for credit losses on loans and\nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, provisions for losses that\nmay arise from litigation and regulatory\nproceedings (including governmental\ninvestigations), and accounting for income\ntaxes. These estimates and assumptions are\nbased on the best available information, but\nactual results could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition Financial Assets and\nLiabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and\nliabilities and certain investments are\ncarried at fair value either under the fair\nvalue option or in accordance with other U.S.\nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to\naccount for certain of its loans and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nby electing the fair value option. The fair\nvalue of a financial instrument is the amount\nthat would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked\nto bid prices and financial liabilities are\nmarked to offer prices. Fair value\nmeasurements do not include transaction costs.\nFair value gains or losses are generally\nincluded in market making or other principal\ntransactions. See Note 4 for further\ninformation about fair value measurements.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    137  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with\nclients for services, such as investment\nbanking, investment management, and execution\nand clearing (contracts with clients), when\nthe performance obligations related to the\nunderlying transaction are completed. Revenues\nfrom contracts with clients represent\napproximately 45% of total non-interest\nrevenues for both 2024 and 2023 (including\napproximately 85% of investment banking\nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment\nmanagement revenues and all commissions and\nfees), and approximately 50% of total non-\ninterest revenues for 2022 (including\napproximately 85% of investment banking\nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment\nmanagement revenues and all commissions and\nfees). See Note 25 for information about net\nrevenues by business segment. Investment\nBanking Advisory. Fees from financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues when\nthe services related to the underlying\ntransaction are completed under the terms of\nthe assignment. Non-refundable deposits and\nmilestone payments in connection with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nin revenues upon completion of the underlying\ntransaction or when the assignment is\notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nwhen incurred and are included in transaction\nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such\nexpenses are included in investment banking\nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon\ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses\nassociated with underwriting assignments are\ngenerally deferred until the related revenue\nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise\nconcluded. Such expenses are included in\ntransaction based expenses for completed\nassignments. Investment Management The firm\nearns management fees and incentive fees for\ninvestment management services, which are\nincluded in investment management revenues.\nThe firm makes payments to brokers and\nadvisors related to the placement of the\nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),\nwhich are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily NAV and are received monthly. Management\nfees for hedge funds are calculated as a\npercentage of month-end NAV and are generally\nreceived quarterly. Management fees for\nseparately managed accounts are calculated as\na percentage of either the daily or monthly\nNAV and are received quarterly. Management\nfees for private equity funds are calculated\nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are generally received\nquarterly, semi-annually or annually,\ndepending on the fund. Management fees are\nrecognized over time in the period the\nservices are provided. Distribution fees paid\nby the firm are calculated based on either a\npercentage of the management fee, the\ninvestment fund\u2019s NAV or the committed\ncapital. Such fees are included in transaction\nbased expenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees\nare calculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or\nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other\nperformance target. Incentive fees are\ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a\nfund. Fees that are based on performance over\na twelve-month period are subject to\nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment\nperformance over the life of the fund, future\ninvestment underperformance may require fees\npreviously distributed to the firm to be\nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned\nfrom a fund or separately managed account are\nrecognized when it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal of such fees will not\noccur, which is generally when such fees are\nno longer subject to fluctuations in the\nmarket value of investments held by the fund\nor separately managed account. Therefore,\nincentive fees recognized during the period\nmay relate to performance obligations\nsatisfied in previous periods.\n                                       \n  138    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm also provides\nthird-party research services to clients in\nconnection with certain soft-dollar\narrangements. Third-party research costs\nincurred by the firm in connection with such\narrangements are presented net within\ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance\nObligations Remaining performance obligations\nare services that the firm has committed to\nperform in the future in connection with its\ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining\nperformance obligations are generally related\nto its financial advisory assignments and\ncertain investment management activities.\nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory\nassignments cannot be determined until the\noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s\ninvestment management activities, where fees\nare calculated based on the NAV of the fund or\nseparately managed account, future revenues\nassociated with such remaining performance\nobligations cannot be determined as such fees\nare subject to fluctuations in the market\nvalue of investments held by the fund or\nseparately managed account. The firm is able\nto determine the future revenues associated\nwith management fees calculated based on\ncommitted capital. As of December 2024,\nsubstantially all future net revenues\nassociated with such remaining performance\nobligations will be recognized through 2033.\nAnnual revenues associated with such\nperformance obligations average less than $\n300million through 2033. Transfers of\nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has\nrelinquished control over the assets\ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses\nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or\nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement with transferred\nfinancial assets are initially recognized at\nfair value. For transfers of financial assets\nthat are not accounted for as sales, the\nassets are generally included in trading\nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a\ncollateralized financing, with the related\ninterest expense recognized over the life of\nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about transfers of financial\nassets accounted for as collateralized\nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted\nfor as sales. Cash and Cash Equivalents The\nfirm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid\novernight deposits held in the ordinary course\nof business. Cash and cash equivalents\nincluded cash and due from banks of $\n5.36billion as of December 2024 and $\n7.93billion as of December 2023. Cash and cash\nequivalents also included interest-bearing\ndeposits with banks of $ 176.73billion as of\nDecember 2024 and $ 233.65billion as of\nDecember 2023. The firm segregates cash for\nregulatory and other purposes related to\nclient activity. Cash and cash equivalents\nsegregated for regulatory and other purposes\nwere $ 14.84billion as of December 2024 and $\n17.08billion as of December 2023. In addition,\nthe firm segregates securities for regulatory\nand other purposes related to client activity.\nSee Note 11 for further information about\nsegregated securities. Customer and Other\nReceivables Customer and other receivables\nincluded receivables from customers and\ncounterparties of $ 92.88billion as of\nDecember 2024 and $ 90.16billion as of\nDecember 2023, and receivables from brokers,\ndealers and clearing organizations of $\n40.84billion as of December 2024 and $\n42.33billion as of December 2023. Such\nreceivables primarily consist of customer\nmargin loans, collateral posted in connection\nwith certain derivative transactions, and\nreceivables resulting from unsettled\ntransactions. Substantially all of these\nreceivables are accounted for at amortized\ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,\nwhich generally approximates fair value. As\nthese receivables are not accounted for at\nfair value, they are not included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5.\nHad these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of\nboth December 2024 and December 2023. See Note\n10 for further information about customer and\nother receivables accounted for at fair value\nunder the fair value option. Interest on\ncustomer and other receivables is recognized\nover the life of the transaction and included\nin interest income. Customer and other\nreceivables includes receivables from\ncontracts with clients and contract assets.\nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to\nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s\nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n4.08billion as of December 2024 and $\n3.59billion as of December 2023. As of both\nDecember 2024 and December 2023, contract\nassets were not material.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    139  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Such\npayables primarily consist of customer credit\nbalances related to the firm\u2019s prime brokerage\nactivities. Customer and other payables are\naccounted for at cost plus accrued interest,\nwhich generally approximates fair value. As\nthese payables are not accounted for at fair\nvalue, they are not included in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had\nthese payables been included in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy, substantially all would\nhave been classified in level 2 as of both\nDecember 2024 and December 2023. Interest on\ncustomer and other payables is recognized over\nthe life of the transaction and included in\ninterest expense. Offsetting Assets and\nLiabilities To reduce credit exposures on\nderivatives and securities financing\ntransactions, the firm may enter into master\nnetting agreements or similar arrangements\n(collectively, netting agreements) with\ncounterparties that permit it to offset\nreceivables and payables with such\ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a\ncontract with a counterparty that permits net\nsettlement of multiple transactions with that\ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of\ntermination rights by a non-defaulting party.\nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all\ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is\ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with\nrespect to its derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms\nof the related credit support agreements or\nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit\nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit\nsupport agreement grants the non-defaulting\nparty exercising termination rights the right\nto liquidate the collateral and apply the\nproceeds to any amounts owed. In order to\nassess enforceability of the firm\u2019s right of\nsetoff under netting and credit support\nagreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in\nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the\nagreement. Derivatives are reported on a net-\nby-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for derivative assets and\nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the\nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting\nagreement. Resale agreements and securities\nsold under agreements to repurchase\n(repurchase agreements) and securities\nborrowed and loaned transactions with the same\nsettlement date are presented on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis in the consolidated balance\nsheets when such transactions meet certain\nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements. In the consolidated balance\nsheets, derivatives are reported net of cash\ncollateral received and posted under\nenforceable credit support agreements, when\ntransacted under an enforceable netting\nagreement. In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and\nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not\nreported net of the related cash and\nsecurities received or posted as collateral.\nSee Note 11 for further information about\ncollateral received and pledged, including\nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See\nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about\noffsetting assets and liabilities. Foreign\nCurrency Translation Assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-U.S. currencies are\ntranslated at rates of exchange prevailing on\nthe date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at\naverage rates of exchange for the period.\nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies\nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a\nnon-U.S. operation, when the functional\ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are\nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive\nincome.\n                                       \n  140    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value Measurements The fair value\nof a financial instrument is the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid\nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not\ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures\ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active\nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by\nreference to prices for similar instruments,\nquoted prices or recent transactions in less\nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or\nindependently sourced inputs, including, but\nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities,\nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding\nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference\nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower\ncould finance a given financial instrument\nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.\nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for\ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This\nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving\nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based\non the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In\nevaluating the significance of a valuation\ninput, the firm considers, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to\nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as\nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical,\nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.\nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are\nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values\nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial\nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain\nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and\nliabilities may require valuation adjustments\nthat a market participant would require to\narrive at fair value for factors, such as\ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments\nare generally based on market evidence.\nThe table below presents financial assets and\nliabilities carried at fair value.\n                                              \n  $

See Note 5 for further\ninformation about significant unobservable\ninputs used to value level 3 financial\ninstruments. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Trading Cash\nInstruments, Investments and Loans Level 1.\nLevel 1 instruments include U.S. government\nobligations, most non-U.S. government\nobligations, certain agency obligations,\ncertain corporate debt instruments, certain\nmoney market instruments and actively traded\nlisted equities. These instruments are valued\nusing quoted prices for identical unrestricted\ninstruments in active markets. The firm\ndefines active markets for equity instruments\nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market\ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm\ndefines active markets for debt instruments\nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity.\nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain\nnon-U.S. government obligations, most agency\nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and\nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,\nmost state and municipal obligations, most\nmoney market instruments, most other debt\nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed\nequities, certain private equities,\ncommodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be\nverified to quoted prices, recent trading\nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative\npricing sources with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency. Consideration is given to\nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor executable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Valuation\nadjustments are typically made to level 2\ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject\nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair\nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally\nbased on market evidence. Level 3. Level 3\ninstruments have one or more significant\nvaluation inputs that are not observable.\nAbsent evidence to the contrary, level 3\ninstruments are initially valued at\ntransaction price, which is considered to be\nthe best initial estimate of fair value.\nSubsequently, the firm uses other\nmethodologies to determine fair value, which\nvary based on the type of instrument.\nValuation inputs and assumptions are changed\nwhen corroborated by substantive observable\nevidence, including values realized on sales.\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments\nvary by instrument, but are generally based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques. The valuation\ntechniques and the nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair values of\neach type of level 3 instrument are described\nbelow: Loans and Securities Backed by\nCommercial Real Estate Loans and securities\nbacked by commercial real estate are directly\nor indirectly collateralized by a single\nproperty or a portfolio of properties, and may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. Significant inputs are\ngenerally determined based on relative value\nanalyses and include: \u2022 Market yields implied\nby transactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and changes in market\nindices, such as the CMBX (an index that\ntracks the performance of commercial mortgage\nbonds); \u2022 Transaction prices in both the\nunderlying collateral and instruments with the\nsame or similar underlying collateral; \u2022 A\nmeasure of expected future cash flows in a\ndefault scenario (recovery rates) implied by\nthe value of the underlying collateral, which\nis mainly driven by current performance of the\nunderlying collateral and capitalization\nrates. Recovery rates are expressed as a\npercentage of notional or face value of the\ninstrument and reflect the benefit of credit\nenhancements on certain instruments; and \u2022\nTiming of expected future cash flows\n(duration) which, in certain cases, may\nincorporate the impact of any loan\nforbearances and other unobservable inputs\n(e.g., prepayment speeds). Loans and\nSecurities Backed by Residential Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by residential\nreal estate are directly or indirectly\ncollateralized by portfolios of residential\nreal estate and may include tranches of\nvarying levels of subordination. Significant\ninputs are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons to instruments with similar\ncollateral and risk profiles. Significant\ninputs include: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets; \u2022\nTransaction prices in both the underlying\ncollateral and instruments with the same or\nsimilar underlying collateral; and \u2022 Duration,\ndriven by underlying loan prepayment speeds\nand residential property liquidation\ntimelines.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    143  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nCorporate Debt Instruments Corporate debt\ninstruments includes corporate loans, debt\nsecurities and convertible debentures.\nSignificant inputs for corporate debt\ninstruments are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons both to prices of credit default\nswaps that reference the same or similar\nunderlying instrument or entity and to other\ndebt instruments for the same or similar\nissuer for which observable prices or broker\nquotations are available. Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks\nthe performance of corporate credit); \u2022\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions\nand, where the firm uses credit default swaps\nto value the related instrument, the cost of\nborrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n\u2022 Duration; and \u2022 Market and transaction\nmultiples for corporate debt instruments with\nconvertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities Equity securities consists\nof private equities. Recent third-party\ncompleted or pending transactions (e.g.,\nmerger proposals, debt restructurings, tender\noffers) are considered the best evidence for\nany change in fair value. When these are not\navailable, the following valuation\nmethodologies are used, as appropriate: \u2022\nIndustry multiples (primarily EBITDA and\nrevenue multiples) and public comparables; \u2022\nTransactions in similar instruments; \u2022\nDiscounted cash flow techniques; and \u2022 Third-\nparty appraisals. The firm also considers\nchanges in the outlook for the relevant\nindustry and financial performance of the\nissuer as compared to projected performance.\nSignificant inputs include: \u2022 Market and\ntransaction multiples; \u2022 Discount rates and\ncapitalization rates; and \u2022 For equity\nsecurities with debt-like features, market\nyields implied by transactions of similar or\nrelated assets, current performance and\nrecovery assumptions, and duration. Other\nTrading Cash Instruments, Investments and\nLoans The significant inputs to the valuation\nof other trading cash instruments, investments\nand loans are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons both to prices of credit default\nswaps that reference the same or similar\nunderlying instrument or entity and to other\ndebt instruments for the same issuer for which\nobservable prices or broker quotations are\navailable. Significant inputs include: \u2022\nMarket yields implied by transactions of\nsimilar or related assets and/or current\nlevels and trends of market indices; \u2022 Current\nperformance and recovery assumptions and,\nwhere the firm uses credit default swaps to\nvalue the related instrument, the cost of\nborrowing the underlying reference obligation;\nand \u2022 Duration. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Derivatives The firm\u2019s\nlevel 2 and level 3 derivatives are valued\nusing derivative pricing models (e.g.,\ndiscounted cash flow models, correlation\nmodels and models that incorporate option\npricing methodologies, such as Monte Carlo\nsimulations). Price transparency of\nderivatives can generally be characterized by\nproduct type, as described below. \u2022 Interest\nRate. In general, the key inputs used to value\ninterest rate derivatives are transparent,\neven for most long-dated contracts. Interest\nrate swaps and options denominated in the\ncurrencies of leading industrialized nations\nare characterized by high trading volumes and\ntight bid/offer spreads. Interest rate\nderivatives that reference indices, such as an\ninflation index, or the shape of the yield\ncurve (e.g., 10-year swap rate vs. 2-year swap\nrate) are more complex, but the key inputs are\ngenerally observable. \u2022 Credit. Price\ntransparency for credit default swaps,\nincluding both single names and baskets of\ncredits, varies by market and underlying\nreference entity or obligation. Credit default\nswaps that reference indices, large corporates\nand major sovereigns generally exhibit the\nmost price transparency. For credit default\nswaps with other underliers, price\ntransparency varies based on credit rating,\nthe cost of borrowing the underlying reference\nobligations, and the availability of the\nunderlying reference obligations for delivery\nupon the default of the issuer. Credit default\nswaps that reference loans, asset-backed\nsecurities and emerging market debt\ninstruments tend to have less price\ntransparency than those that reference\ncorporate bonds. In addition, more complex\ncredit derivatives, such as those sensitive to\nthe correlation between two or more underlying\nreference obligations, generally have less\nprice transparency.\n                                       \n  144    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n\u2022 Currency. Prices for currency derivatives\nbased on the exchange rates of leading\nindustrialized nations, including those with\nlonger tenors, are generally transparent. The\nprimary difference between the price\ntransparency of developed and emerging market\ncurrency derivatives is that emerging markets\ntend to be only observable for contracts with\nshorter tenors. \u2022 Commodity. Commodity\nderivatives include transactions referenced to\nenergy (e.g., oil, natural gas and\nelectricity), metals (e.g., precious and base)\nand soft commodities (e.g., agricultural).\nPrice transparency varies based on the\nunderlying commodity, delivery location, tenor\nand product quality (e.g., diesel fuel\ncompared to unleaded gasoline). In general,\nprice transparency for commodity derivatives\nis greater for contracts with shorter tenors\nand contracts that are more closely aligned\nwith major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n\u2022 Equity. Price transparency for equity\nderivatives varies by market and underlier.\nOptions on indices and the common stock of\ncorporates included in major equity indices\nexhibit the most price transparency. Equity\nderivatives generally have observable market\nprices, except for contracts with long tenors\nor reference prices that differ significantly\nfrom current market prices. More complex\nequity derivatives, such as those sensitive to\nthe correlation between two or more individual\nstocks, generally have less price\ntransparency. Liquidity is essential to the\nobservability of all product types. If\ntransaction volumes decline, previously\ntransparent prices and other inputs may become\nunobservable. Conversely, even highly\nstructured products may at times have trading\nvolumes large enough to provide observability\nof prices and other inputs. Level 1. Level 1\nderivatives include short-term contracts for\nfuture delivery of securities when the\nunderlying security is a level 1 instrument,\nand exchange-traded derivatives if they are\nactively traded and are valued at their quoted\nmarket price. Level 2. Level 2 derivatives\ninclude OTC derivatives for which all\nsignificant valuation inputs are corroborated\nby market evidence and exchange-traded\nderivatives that are not actively traded\nand/or that are valued using models that\ncalibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC\nderivatives. The selection of a particular\nmodel to value a derivative depends on the\ncontractual terms of and specific risks\ninherent in the instrument, as well as the\navailability of pricing information in the\nmarket. For derivatives that trade in liquid\nmarkets, model selection does not involve\nsignificant management judgment because\noutputs of models can be calibrated to market-\nclearing levels. Valuation models require a\nvariety of inputs, such as contractual terms,\nmarket prices, yield curves, discount rates\n(including those derived from interest rates\non collateral received and posted as specified\nin credit support agreements for\ncollateralized derivatives), credit curves,\nmeasures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss\nseverity rates and correlations of such\ninputs. Significant inputs to the valuations\nof level 2 derivatives can be verified to\nmarket transactions, broker or dealer\nquotations or other alternative pricing\nsources with reasonable levels of price\ntransparency. Consideration is given to the\nnature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or\nexecutable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Level 3 . Level 3\nderivatives are valued using models which\nutilize observable level 1 and/or level 2\ninputs, as well as unobservable level 3\ninputs. The significant unobservable inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s level 3 derivatives\nare described below. \u2022 For level 3 interest\nrate and currency derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include correlations of\ncertain currencies and interest rates (e.g.,\nthe correlation between Euro inflation and\nEuro interest rates) and specific interest\nrate and currency volatilities. \u2022 For level 3\ncredit derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs include illiquid credit spreads and\nupfront credit points, which are unique to\nspecific reference obligations and reference\nentities, and recovery rates. \u2022 For level 3\ncommodity derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include volatilities for\noptions with strike prices that differ\nsignificantly from current market prices and\nprices or spreads for certain products for\nwhich the product quality or physical location\nof the commodity is not aligned with benchmark\nindices. \u2022 For level 3 equity derivatives,\nsignificant unobservable inputs generally\ninclude equity volatility inputs for options\nthat are long-dated and/or have strike prices\nthat differ significantly from current market\nprices. In addition, the valuation of certain\nstructured trades requires the use of level 3\ncorrelation inputs, such as the correlation of\nthe price performance of two or more\nindividual stocks or the correlation of the\nprice performance for a basket of stocks to\nanother asset class, such as commodities.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    145  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Level 3 inputs are\nchanged when corroborated by evidence, such as\nsimilar market transactions, third-party\npricing services and/or broker or dealer\nquotations or other empirical market data. In\ncircumstances where the firm cannot verify the\nmodel value by reference to market\ntransactions, it is possible that a different\nvaluation model could produce a materially\ndifferent estimate of fair value. See Note 5\nfor further information about significant\nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of\nlevel 3 derivatives. Valuation Adjustments.\nValuation adjustments are integral to\ndetermining the fair value of derivative\nportfolios and are used to adjust the mid-\nmarket valuations produced by derivative\npricing models to the exit price valuation.\nThese adjustments incorporate bid/offer\nspreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and\nfunding valuation adjustments, which account\nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in\nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative\nportfolios. The firm also makes funding\nvaluation adjustments to collateralized\nderivatives where the terms of the agreement\ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge\ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are\ngenerally used when calibrating valuation\nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In\naddition, for derivatives that include\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm\nmakes model or exit price adjustments to\naccount for the valuation uncertainty present\nin the transaction. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Other Financial Assets\nand Liabilities at Fair Value In addition to\ntrading cash instruments, derivatives, and\ncertain investments and loans, the firm\naccounts for certain of its other financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value under the\nfair value option. Such instruments include\nrepurchase agreements and substantially all\nresale agreements; certain securities borrowed\nand loaned transactions; certain customer and\nother receivables, including certain margin\nloans; certain time deposits, including\nstructured certificates of deposit, which are\nhybrid financial instruments; substantially\nall other secured financings, including\nstructured financing arrangements and\ntransfers of assets accounted for as\nfinancings; certain unsecured short- and long-\nterm borrowings, substantially all of which\nare hybrid financial instruments; and certain\nother assets and liabilities. These\ninstruments are generally valued based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques, which\nincorporate inputs with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency, and are generally\nclassified in level 2 because the inputs are\nobservable. Valuation adjustments may be made\nfor liquidity and for counterparty and the\nfirm\u2019s credit quality. The significant inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s other financial\nassets and liabilities are described below.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements and\nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of resale\nand repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and interest rates. Customer and Other\nReceivables. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of receivables are interest rates,\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and funding spreads. Deposits. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of time\ndeposits are interest rates and the amount and\ntiming of future cash flows. The inputs used\nto value the embedded derivative component of\nhybrid financial instruments are consistent\nwith the inputs used to value the firm\u2019s other\nderivative instruments described above. See\nNote 7 for further information about\nderivatives and Note 13 for further\ninformation about deposits. Other Secured\nFinancings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other secured financings are the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, funding spreads and the\nfair value of the collateral delivered by the\nfirm (determined using the amount and timing\nof expected future cash flows, market prices,\nmarket yields and recovery assumptions). See\nNote 11 for further information about other\nsecured financings. Unsecured Short- and Long-\nTerm Borrowings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of unsecured short- and long-term\nborrowings are the amount and timing of\nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,\nthe credit spreads of the firm and commodity\nprices for prepaid commodity transactions. The\ninputs used to value the embedded derivative\ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are\nconsistent with the inputs used to value the\nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described\nabove. See Note 7 for further information\nabout derivatives and Note 14 for further\ninformation about borrowings. Other Assets and\nLiabilities. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other assets and liabilities are\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, market yields,\nvolatility and correlation inputs. The inputs\nused to value the embedded derivative\ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are\nconsistent with the inputs used to value the\nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described\nabove.

For\nexample, the highest\nrecovery rate for\ncorporate debt\ninstruments is\nappropriate for\nvaluing a specific\ncorporate debt\ninstrument, but may\nnot be appropriate for\nvaluing any other\ncorporate debt\ninstrument.\nAccordingly, the\nranges of inputs do\nnot represent\nuncertainty in, or\npossible ranges of,\nfair value\nmeasurements of level\n3 trading cash\ninstruments. \u2022\nIncreases in yield or\nduration used in the\nvaluation of level 3\ntrading cash\ninstruments would have\nresulted in a lower\nfair value\nmeasurement, while\nincreases in recovery\nrate or multiples\nwould have resulted in\na higher fair value\nmeasurement as of both\nDecember 2024 and\nDecember 2023. Due to\nthe distinctive nature\nof each level 3\ntrading cash\ninstrument, the\ninterrelationship of\ninputs is not\nnecessarily uniform\nwithin each product\ntype. \u2022 Trading cash\ninstruments are valued\nusing discounted cash\nflows. \u2022 The\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nfor multiples related\nto other trading cash\ninstruments as of\nDecember 2024 did not\nhave a range (and\nthere was no weighted\naverage) as it related\nto a single position.\nTherefore, such\nunobservable inputs\nare not included in\nthe table above.\n\nLevel 3 Rollforward.\nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level 3\ntrading cash\ninstruments.\n                                              \n                  Year                        \n  $ in           Ended                        \n  milli\u2026       Decemb\u2026  2024            2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Assets                                      \n  Begin\u2026    $    1,791        $  1,734        \n  balan\u2026                                      \n  Net                                         \n  reali\u2026           161             154        \n  gains\u2026                                      \n  Net                                         \n  unrea\u2026             7             -32        \n  gains\u2026                                      \n  Purch\u2026           512             825        \n  Sales           -618            -515        \n  Settl\u2026          -382            -286        \n  Trans\u2026                                      \n  into             222             167        \n  level                                       \n  3                                           \n  Trans\u2026                                      \n  out of          -480            -256        \n  level                                       \n  3                                           \n  Ending    $    1,213        $  1,791        \n  balan\u2026                                      \n  Liabi\u2026                                      \n  Begin\u2026    $      -78        $    -64        \n  balan\u2026                                      \n  Net                                         \n  reali\u2026             4               3        \n  gains\u2026                                      \n  Net                                         \n  unrea\u2026           -25             -66        \n  gains\u2026                                      \n  Purch\u2026            57              90        \n  Sales            -43             -77        \n  Settl\u2026             1               1        \n  Trans\u2026                                      \n  into              -9              -3        \n  level                                       \n  3                                           \n  Trans\u2026                                      \n  out of            18              38        \n  level                                       \n  3                                           \n  Ending    $      -75        $    -78        \n  balan\u2026                                      \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\n\u2022 Changes in fair\nvalue are presented\nfor all trading cash\ninstruments that are\nclassified in level 3\nas of the end of the\nperiod.\n\n\u2022 Net unrealized\ngains/(losses) relates\nto trading cash\ninstruments that were\nstill held at period-\nend.\n\n\u2022 Transfers between\nlevels of the fair\nvalue hierarchy are\nreported at the\nbeginning of the\nreporting period in\nwhich they occur.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n\u2022 Averages represent the arithmetic average of\nthe inputs and are not weighted by the\nrelative fair value or notional amount of the\nrespective financial instruments. An average\ngreater than the median indicates that the\nmajority of inputs are below the average. For\nexample, the difference between the average\nand the median for credit spreads indicates\nthat the majority of the inputs fall in the\nlower end of the range. \u2022 The ranges, averages\nand medians of these inputs are not\nrepresentative of the appropriate inputs to\nuse when calculating the fair value of any one\nderivative. For example, the highest\ncorrelation for interest rate derivatives is\nappropriate for valuing a specific interest\nrate derivative but may not be appropriate for\nvaluing any other interest rate derivative.\nAccordingly, the ranges of inputs do not\nrepresent uncertainty in, or possible ranges\nof, fair value measurements of level 3\nderivatives. \u2022 Interest rates, currencies and\nequities derivatives are valued using option\npricing models, credit derivatives are valued\nusing option pricing, correlation and\ndiscounted cash flow models, and commodities\nderivatives are valued using option pricing\nand discounted cash flow models. \u2022 The fair\nvalue of any one instrument may be determined\nusing multiple valuation techniques. For\nexample, option pricing models and discounted\ncash flow models are typically used together\nto determine fair value. Therefore, the level\n3 balance encompasses both of these\ntechniques. \u2022 Correlation within currencies\nand equities includes cross-product type\ncorrelation. \u2022 Natural gas spread represents\nthe spread per million British thermal units\nof natural gas. \u2022 Oil spread represents the\nspread per barrel of oil and refined products.\n\u2022 Electricity price represents the price per\nmegawatt hour of electricity. Range of\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs. The following\nprovides information about the ranges of\nsignificant unobservable inputs used to value\nthe firm\u2019s level 3 derivative instruments: \u2022\nCorrelation. Ranges for correlation cover a\nvariety of underliers both within one product\ntype (e.g., equity index and equity single\nstock names) and across product types (e.g.,\ncorrelation of an interest rate and a\ncurrency), as well as across regions.\nGenerally, cross-product type correlation\ninputs are used to value more complex\ninstruments and are lower than correlation\ninputs on assets within the same derivative\nproduct type. \u2022 Volatility. Ranges for\nvolatility cover numerous underliers across a\nvariety of markets, maturities and strike\nprices. For example, volatility of equity\nindices is generally lower than volatility of\nsingle stocks. \u2022 Credit spreads, upfront\ncredit points and recovery rates. The ranges\nfor credit spreads, upfront credit points and\nrecovery rates cover a variety of underliers\n(index and single names), regions, sectors,\nmaturities and credit qualities (high-yield\nand investment-grade). The broad range of this\npopulation gives rise to the width of the\nranges of significant unobservable inputs. \u2022\nCommodity prices and spreads. The ranges for\ncommodity prices and spreads cover variability\nin products, maturities and delivery\nlocations. Sensitivity of Fair Value\nMeasurement to Changes in Significant\nUnobservable Inputs. The following is a\ndescription of the directional sensitivity of\nthe firm\u2019s level 3 fair value measurements to\nchanges in significant unobservable inputs, in\nisolation, as of each period-end: \u2022\nCorrelation. In general, for contracts where\nthe holder benefits from the convergence of\nthe underlying asset or index prices (e.g.,\ninterest rates, credit spreads, foreign\nexchange rates, inflation rates and equity\nprices), an increase in correlation results in\na higher fair value measurement. \u2022 Volatility.\nIn general, for purchased options, an increase\nin volatility results in a higher fair value\nmeasurement. \u2022 Credit spreads, upfront credit\npoints and recovery rates. In general, the\nfair value of purchased credit protection\nincreases as credit spreads or upfront credit\npoints increase or recovery rates decrease.\nCredit spreads, upfront credit points and\nrecovery rates are strongly related to\ndistinctive risk factors of the underlying\nreference obligations, which include reference\nentity-specific factors, such as leverage,\nvolatility and industry, market-based risk\nfactors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity\nof the underlying reference obligation, and\nmacroeconomic conditions. \u2022 Commodity prices\nand spreads. In general, for contracts where\nthe holder is receiving a commodity, an\nincrease in the spread (price difference from\na benchmark index due to differences in\nquality or delivery location) or price results\nin a higher fair value measurement. Due to the\ndistinctive nature of each of the firm\u2019s level\n3 derivatives, the interrelationship of inputs\nis not necessarily uniform within each product\ntype.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    151  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For\nexample, the highest\nmultiple for private\nequity securities is\nappropriate for\nvaluing a specific\nprivate equity\nsecurity but may not\nbe appropriate for\nvaluing any other\nprivate equity\nsecurity.

Due to\nthe distinctive nature\nof each level 3\ninvestment, the\ninterrelationship of\ninputs is not\nnecessarily uniform\nwithin each product\ntype.\n\u2022 Corporate debt\nsecurities, securities\nbacked by real estate\nand other debt\nobligations are valued\nusing discounted cash\nflows, and equity\nsecurities are valued\nusing market\ncomparables and\ndiscounted cash flows.\n\u2022 The fair value of\nany one instrument may\nbe determined using\nmultiple valuation\ntechniques. For\nexample, market\ncomparables and\ndiscounted cash flows\nmay be used together\nto determine fair\nvalue.

For example, the\nhighest yield for corporate loans is\nappropriate for valuing a specific corporate\nloan but may not be appropriate for valuing\nany other corporate loan. Accordingly, the\nranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty\nin, or possible ranges of, fair value\nmeasurements of level 3 loans. \u2022 Increases in\nyield or duration used in the valuation of\nlevel 3 loans would have resulted in a lower\nfair value measurement, while increases in\nrecovery rate would have resulted in a higher\nfair value measurement as of both December\n2024 and December 2023. Due to the distinctive\nnature of each level 3 loan, the\ninterrelationship of inputs is not necessarily\nuniform within each product type. \u2022 Loans are\nvalued using discounted cash flows. \u2022 The\nsignificant unobservable inputs for yield and\nduration (related to other loans) as of\nDecember 2024 did not have a range (and there\nwas no weighted average) as each pertained to\na single position.

Certain of the\nfirm\u2019s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled\nthrough central clearing counterparties (OTC-\ncleared), while others are bilateral contracts\nbetween two counterparties (bilateral OTC).\nMarket Making. As a market maker, the firm\nenters into derivative transactions to provide\nliquidity to clients and to facilitate the\ntransfer and hedging of their risks. In this\nrole, the firm typically acts as principal and\nis required to commit capital to provide\nexecution, and maintains market-making\npositions in response to, or in anticipation\nof, client demand. Risk Management. The firm\nalso enters into derivatives to actively\nmanage risk exposures that arise from its\nmarket-making and investing and financing\nactivities. The firm\u2019s holdings and exposures\nare hedged, in many cases, on either a\nportfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed\nto an instrument-by-instrument basis. The\noffsetting impact of this economic hedging is\nreflected in the same business segment as the\nrelated revenues. In addition, the firm may\nenter into derivatives designated as hedges\nunder U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to\nmanage interest rate exposure of certain\nfixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits\nand certain U.S. and non-U.S. government\nsecurities classified as available-for-sale,\nforeign exchange risk of certain available-\nfor-sale securities, the net investment in\ncertain non-U.S. operations and the exposure\nto the variability of the forecasted cash\nflows associated with certain floating-rate\nassets.\n\nThe firm enters into various types of\nderivatives, including: \u2022 Futures and\nForwards. Contracts that commit counterparties\nto purchase or sell financial instruments,\ncommodities or currencies in the future. \u2022\nSwaps. Contracts that require counterparties\nto exchange cash flows, such as currency or\ninterest payment streams. The amounts\nexchanged are based on the specific terms of\nthe contract with reference to specified\nrates, financial instruments, commodities,\ncurrencies or indices. \u2022 Options. Contracts in\nwhich the option purchaser has the right, but\nnot the obligation, to purchase from or sell\nto the option writer financial instruments,\ncommodities or currencies within a defined\ntime period for a specified price. Derivatives\nare reported on a net-by-counterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable or receivable for\nderivative assets and liabilities for a given\ncounterparty) when a legal right of setoff\nexists under an enforceable netting agreement\n(counterparty netting). Derivatives are\naccounted for at fair value, net of cash\ncollateral received or posted under\nenforceable credit support agreements (cash\ncollateral netting). Derivative assets are\nincluded in trading assetsand derivative\nliabilities are included in trading\nliabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and\nlosseson derivatives not designated as hedges\nare included in market making (for derivatives\nincluded in Fixed Income, Currency and\nCommodities (FICC) and Equities within Global\nBanking & Markets), and other principal\ntransactions (for derivatives included in\nInvestment banking fees and Other within\nGlobal Banking & Markets, as well as\nderivatives in Asset & Wealth Management) in\nthe consolidated statements of earnings. For\nboth 2024 and 2023, substantially all of the\nfirm\u2019s derivatives were included in Global\nBanking & Markets.\n                                       \n  162    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Credit Derivatives The firm\nenters into a broad array of credit\nderivatives to facilitate client transactions\nand to manage the credit risk associated with\nmarket-making and investing and financing\nactivities. Credit derivatives are actively\nmanaged based on the firm\u2019s net risk position.\nCredit derivatives are generally individually\nnegotiated contracts and can have various\nsettlement and payment conventions. Credit\nevents include failure to pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of indebtedness, restructuring,\nrepudiation and dissolution of the reference\nentity. The firm enters into the following\ntypes of credit derivatives: \u2022 Credit Default\nSwaps. Single-name credit default swaps\nprotect the buyer against the loss of\nprincipal on one or more bonds, loans or\nmortgages (reference obligations) in the event\nthe issuer of the reference obligations\nsuffers a credit event. The buyer of\nprotection pays an initial or periodic premium\nto the seller and receives protection for the\nperiod of the contract. If there is no credit\nevent, as defined in the contract, the seller\nof protection makes no payments to the buyer.\nIf a credit event occurs, the seller of\nprotection is required to make a payment to\nthe buyer, calculated according to the terms\nof the contract. \u2022 Credit Options. In a credit\noption, the option writer assumes the\nobligation to purchase or sell a reference\nobligation at a specified price or credit\nspread. The option purchaser buys the right,\nbut does not assume the obligation, to sell\nthe reference obligation to, or purchase it\nfrom, the option writer. The payments on\ncredit options depend either on a particular\ncredit spread or the price of the reference\nobligation.\n                                       \n  164    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n\u2022 Credit Indices, Baskets and Tranches. Credit\nderivatives may reference a basket of single-\nname credit default swaps or a broad-based\nindex. If a credit event occurs in one of the\nunderlying reference obligations, the\nprotection seller pays the protection buyer.\nThe payment is typically a pro-rata portion of\nthe transaction\u2019s total notional amount based\non the underlying defaulted reference\nobligation. In certain transactions, the\ncredit risk of a basket or index is separated\ninto various portions (tranches), each having\ndifferent levels of subordination.

A total return swap\ntransfers the risks relating to economic\nperformance of a reference obligation from the\nprotection buyer to the protection seller.\nTypically, the protection buyer receives a\nfloating rate of interest and protection\nagainst any reduction in fair value of the\nreference obligation, and the protection\nseller receives the cash flows associated with\nthe reference obligation, plus any increase in\nthe fair value of the reference obligation.\nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to\nwritten credit derivatives primarily by\nentering into offsetting purchased credit\nderivatives with identical underliers.\nSubstantially all of the firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative transactions are with\nfinancial institutions and are subject to\nstringent collateral thresholds. In addition,\nupon the occurrence of a specified trigger\nevent, the firm may take possession of the\nreference obligations underlying a particular\nwritten credit derivative, and consequently\nmay, upon liquidation of the reference\nobligations, recover amounts on the underlying\nreference obligations in the event of default.\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout credit\nderivatives.\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026  0        \u2026              \u2026         \n         \u2026  -        -              \u2026         \n         \u2026  \u2026        \u2026              \u2026         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 Fair values exclude\nthe effects of both\nnetting of receivable\nbalances with payable\nbalances under\nenforceable netting\nagreements, and\nnetting of cash\nreceived or posted\nunder enforceable\ncredit support\nagreements, and\ntherefore are not\nrepresentative of the\nfirm\u2019s credit\nexposure.\n\u2022 Tenor is based on\nthe remaining\ncontractual maturity\nfor substantially all\nwritten credit\nderivatives.\n\u2022 The credit spread on\nthe underlier,\ntogether with the\ntenor of the contract,\nare indicators of\npayment/performance\nrisk.

If the firm has the intent to sell\nthe debt security, or if it is more likely\nthan not that the firm will be required to\nsell the debt security before recovery of its\namortized cost, the difference between the\namortized cost (net of allowance, if any) and\nthe fair value of the securities is recognized\nas an impairment loss in earnings. The firm\ndid not record any such impairment losses\nduring either 2024 or 2023. Impaired\navailable-for-sale debt securities that the\nfirm has the intent and ability to hold are\nreviewed to determine if an allowance for\ncredit losses should be recorded. The firm\nconsiders various factors in such\ndetermination, including market conditions,\nchanges in issuer credit ratings and severity\nof the unrealized losses. The firm did not\nrecord any provision for credit losses on such\nsecurities during either 2024 or 2023. The\ngross realized gains and gross realized losses\nrelating to the sales of available-for-sale\nsecurities were not material for each of 2024,\n2023 and 2022.

Corporate\nloans are secured (typically by a senior lien\non the assets of the borrower) or unsecured,\ndepending on the loan purpose, the risk\nprofile of the borrower and other factors. \u2022\nCommercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate\nloans includes originated loans that are\ndirectly or indirectly secured by hotels,\nretail stores, multifamily housing complexes\nand commercial and industrial properties.\nCommercial real estate loans also includes\nloans extended to clients who warehouse assets\nthat are directly or indirectly backed by\ncommercial real estate. In addition,\ncommercial real estate includes loans\npurchased by the firm. \u2022 Residential Real\nEstate. Residential real estate loans\nprimarily includes loans extended to wealth\nmanagement clients and to clients who\nwarehouse assets that are directly or\nindirectly secured by residential real estate.\nIn addition, residential real estate includes\nloans purchased by the firm. \u2022 Securities-\nBased. Securities-based loans includes loans\nthat are secured by stocks, bonds, mutual\nfunds, and exchange-traded funds. These loans\nare primarily extended to the firm\u2019s wealth\nmanagement clients and used for purposes other\nthan purchasing, carrying or trading margin\nstocks. Securities-based loans require\nborrowers to post additional collateral on a\ndaily basis (daily margin requirement) based\non changes in the underlying collateral\u2019s fair\nvalue. \u2022 Other Collateralized. Other\ncollateralized loans includes loans that are\nbacked by specific collateral (other than\nsecurities-based loans where there is a daily\nmargin requirement and real estate loans).\nSuch loans are extended to clients who\nwarehouse assets that are directly or\nindirectly secured by corporate loans,\nconsumer loans and other assets. Other\ncollateralized loans also includes loans to\ninvestment funds (managed by third parties)\nthat are collateralized by capital commitments\nof the funds\u2019 investors or assets held by the\nfund, as well as other secured loans extended\nto the firm\u2019s wealth management and corporate\nclients. \u2022 Installment. Installment loans are\nunsecured loans that were originated by the\nfirm. \u2022 Credit Cards. Credit card loans are\nloans made pursuant to revolving lines of\ncredit issued to consumers by the firm. \u2022\nOther. Other loans primarily includes\nunsecured loans extended to wealth management\nclients and unsecured consumer loans purchased\nby the firm. See Note 4 for an overview of the\nfirm\u2019s fair value measurement policies,\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nused to determine the fair value of loans, and\nNote 5 for information about loans within the\nfair value hierarchy. Credit Quality Risk\nAssessment. The firm\u2019s risk assessment process\nincludes evaluating the credit quality of its\nloans by Risk. For corporate loans and a\nmajority of securities-based, real estate,\nother collateralized and other loans, the firm\nperforms credit analyses which incorporate\ninitial and ongoing evaluations of the\ncapacity and willingness of a borrower to meet\nits financial obligations.

To\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, the firm\nclassifies its loans\nand lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at amortized cost\ninto wholesale and\nconsumer portfolios.\nThese portfolios\nrepresent the level at\nwhich the firm has\ndeveloped and\ndocumented its\nmethodology to\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. The allowance\nfor credit losses is\nmeasured on a\ncollective basis for\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics using\na modeled approach and\non an asset-specific\nbasis for loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses takes\ninto account the\nweighted average of a\nrange of forecasts of\nfuture economic\nconditions over the\nexpected life of the\nloans and lending\ncommitments. The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-\nyearperiod. For loans\nwith expected lives\nbeyond three years,\nthe model reverts to\nhistorical loss\ninformation based on a\nnon-linear modeled\napproach. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios described\nbelow. The firm\napplies judgment in\nweighing individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including the\nfirm\u2019s internally\nderived economic\noutlook, market\nconsensus, recent\nmacroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends.

The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for wholesale\nloans and lending\ncommitments that\nexhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics is\nmeasured using a\nmodeled approach.\nThese models determine\nthe probability of\ndefault and loss given\ndefault based on\nvarious risk factors,\nincluding internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators, the\nborrower\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial\nobligations, the\nborrower\u2019s country of\nrisk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. For\nlending commitments,\nthe methodology also\nconsiders the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding.\nIn addition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nthe loan-to-value\nratio, debt service\nratio and home price\nindex. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nwholesale loans and\nlending commitments\ninclude unemployment\nrates, GDP, credit\nspreads, commercial\nand industrial\ndelinquency rates,\nshort- and long-term\ninterest rates, and\noil prices. The\nallowance for loan\nlosses for wholesale\nloans that do not\nshare similar risk\ncharacteristics, such\nas nonaccrual loans,\nis calculated using\nthe present value of\nexpected future cash\nflows discounted at\nthe loan\u2019s effective\nrate, the observable\nmarket price of the\nloan, or, in the case\nof collateral\ndependent loans, the\nfair value of the\ncollateral less\nestimated costs to\nsell, if applicable.\nWholesale loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\nConsumer. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for consumer\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics is\ncalculated using a\nmodeled approach which\nclassifies consumer\nloans into pools based\non borrower-related\nand exposure-related\ncharacteristics that\ndifferentiate a pool\u2019s\nrisk characteristics\nfrom other pools. The\nfactors considered in\ndetermining a pool are\ngenerally consistent\nwith the risk\ncharacteristics used\nfor internal credit\nrisk measurement and\nmanagement and include\nkey metrics, such as\nFICO credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nconsumer loans include\nunemployment rates and\ndelinquency rates. The\nexpected life of\nrevolving credit card\nloans is determined by\nmodeling expected\nfuture draws and the\ntiming and amount of\nrepayments allocated\nto the funded balance.\nThe firm does not\nrecognize an allowance\nfor credit losses on\ncredit card lending\ncommitments as they\nare cancellable by the\nfirm. Credit card\nloans are charged off\nwhen they are 180 days\npast due. Installment\nloans were charged off\nwhen they were 120\ndays past due.\n\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses Rollforward\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout the allowance\nfor credit losses.\n

As of\nDecember 2024, this\nmulti-scenario\nforecast was weighted\ntowards the baseline\nand adverse economic\nscenarios.\nThe table below\npresents the\nforecasted U.S.\nunemployment and U.S.\nGDP growth rates used\nin the baseline\neconomic scenario of\nthe forecast model.\n                                              \n  U.S.                                        \n  unemployment                                \n  rate                                        \n  Forecast for the         As of December     \n  quarter ended:           2024               \n  June 2025           4.4  %                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  December 2025       4.4  %                  \n  June 2026           4.3  %                  \n  Growth in U.S.                              \n  GDP                                         \n  Forecast for the                            \n  year:                                       \n  2025                2.0  %                  \n  2026                1.7  %                  \n  2027                1.7  %                  \n                                              \nThe adverse economic\nscenario of the\nforecast model\nreflects a global\nrecession in the first\nquarter of 2025\nthrough the first\nquarter of 2026,\nresulting in an\neconomic contraction\nand rising\nunemployment rates. In\nthis scenario, the\nU.S. unemployment rate\npeaks at approximately\n7.4% during the first\nquarter of 2026 and\nthe maximum decline in\nthe quarterly U.S. GDP\nrelative to the fourth\nquarter of 2024 is\napproximately 2.7%,\nwhich occurs during\nthe fourth quarter of\n2025.\nIn the table above:\n\u2022 U.S. unemployment\nrate represents the\nrate forecasted as of\nthe respective\nquarter-end.\n\u2022 Growth in U.S. GDP\nrepresents the year-\nover-year growth rate\nforecasted for the\nrespective years.\n\u2022 While the U.S.\nunemployment and U.S.\nGDP growth rates are\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model,\nthe model contemplates\na variety of other\ninputs across a range\nof scenarios to\nprovide a forecast of\nfuture economic\nconditions. Given the\ncomplex nature of the\nforecasting process,\nno single economic\nvariable can be viewed\nin isolation and\nindependently of other\ninputs.\n\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses Commentary Year\nEnded December 2024.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses\ndecreased by $\n330million during\n2024, primarily\nreflecting a reserve\nrelease relating to\nthe wholesale\nportfolio due to\nimproved macroeconomic\nenvironment, partially\noffset by growth in\nthe credit card\nportfolio. Charge-offs\nfor 2024 for wholesale\nloans (principally\nrelated to term loans\noriginated in 2022 and\n2021) were primarily\nrelated to corporate\nloans and charge-offs\nfor consumer loans\nwere primarily related\nto credit cards. Year\nEnded December 2023.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses\ndecreased by $\n647million during\n2023, reflecting a net\nrelease related to the\nGreenSky installment\nloan portfolio\n(including a reserve\nreduction of $\n637million related to\nthe partial sale and\ntransfer of the\nportfolio to held for\nsale), a reserve\nreduction of $\n442million associated\nwith the sale of\nMarcus loans, a\nreserve reduction of $\n160million related to\nthe transfer of the GM\nco-branded credit card\nportfolio to held for\nsale, a reserve\nrelease in the\nconsumer portfolio\nbased on actual\nrepayment experience\nand lower balances in\ncorporate loans due to\nsales and paydowns,\npartially offset by\nasset-specific\nprovisions and ratings\ndowngrades in the\nwholesale portfolio\nand seasoning of the\ncredit card portfolio.\nCharge-offs for 2023\nfor wholesale loans\n(principally related\nto term loans\noriginated in 2021 and\nrevolving loans) were\nprimarily related to\ncorporate loans and\ncharge-offs for\nconsumer loans were\nprimarily related to\ncredit cards.\nEstimated Fair Value\nThe table below\npresents the estimated\nfair value of loans\nthat are not accounted\nfor at fair value and\nin what level of the\nfair value hierarchy\nthey would have been\nclassified if they had\nbeen included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value\nhierarchy.\n                                              \n                       \u2026                      \n            \u2026    \u2026     \u2026  \u2026                   \n            \u2026    2     \u2026  3         \u2026         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026          $  \u2026     $  8\u2026     $  1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026          $  \u2026     $  6\u2026     $  3\u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026          $  \u2026     $  8\u2026     $  1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026          $  \u2026     $  3\u2026     $  7\u2026  \n                                              \nSee Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s\nfair value measurement\npolicies, valuation\ntechniques and\nsignificant inputs\nused to determine the\nfair value of loans,\nand Note 5 for\ninformation about\nloans within the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\n                                       \n  180    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value\nOption Other Financial\nAssets and Liabilities\nat Fair Value In\naddition to trading\nassets and\nliabilities, and\ncertain investments\nand loans, the firm\naccounts for certain\nof its other financial\nassets and liabilities\nat fair value,\nsubstantially all\nunder the fair value\noption. The primary\nreasons for electing\nthe fair value option\nare to: \u2022 Reflect\neconomic events in\nearnings on a timely\nbasis; \u2022 Mitigate\nvolatility in earnings\nfrom using different\nmeasurement attributes\n(e.g., transfers of\nfinancial assets\naccounted for as\nfinancings are\nrecorded at fair\nvalue, whereas the\nrelated secured\nfinancing would be\nrecorded on an accrual\nbasis absent electing\nthe fair value\noption); and \u2022 Address\nsimplification and\ncost-benefit\nconsiderations (e.g.,\naccounting for hybrid\nfinancial instruments\nat fair value in their\nentirety versus\nbifurcation of\nembedded derivatives\nand hedge accounting\nfor debt hosts).\nHybrid financial\ninstruments are\ninstruments that\ncontain bifurcatable\nembedded derivatives\nand do not require\nsettlement by physical\ndelivery of\nnonfinancial assets\n(e.g., physical\ncommodities). Unless\nthe firm has elected\nto account for the\nentire hybrid\nfinancial instrument\nat fair value under\nthe fair value option,\nthe embedded\nderivative is\nbifurcated from the\nassociated host\ncontract, the\nderivative is\naccounted for at fair\nvalue and the host\ncontract is accounted\nfor at amortized cost,\nadjusted for the\neffective portion of\nany fair value hedges.\nOther financial assets\nand liabilities\naccounted for at fair\nvalue under the fair\nvalue option include:\n\u2022 Repurchase\nagreements and\nsubstantially all\nresale agreements; \u2022\nCertain securities\nborrowed and loaned\ntransactions; \u2022\nCertain customer and\nother receivables and\ncertain other assets\nand liabilities; \u2022\nCertain time deposits\n(deposits with no\nstated maturity are\nnot eligible for a\nfair value option\nelection), including\nstructured\ncertificates of\ndeposit, which are\nhybrid financial\ninstruments; \u2022\nSubstantially all\nother secured\nfinancings, including\nstructured financing\narrangements and\ntransfers of assets\naccounted for as\nfinancings; and \u2022\nCertain unsecured\nshort- and long-term\nborrowings,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich are hybrid\nfinancial instruments.\n\nSee Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s\nfair value measurement\npolicies, valuation\ntechniques and\nsignificant inputs\nused to determine the\nfair value of other\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities, and Note\n5 for information\nabout other financial\nassets and liabilities\nwithin the fair value\nhierarchy.

As a result, gains or\nlosses on other financial assets and\nliabilities do not necessarily represent the\noverall impact on the firm\u2019s results of\noperations, liquidity or capital resources.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    181  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See\nNote 18 for further\ninformation about\nlending commitments.\n\nImpact of Credit\nSpreads on Loans and\nLending Commitments\nThe estimated net loss\nattributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads on loans and\nlending commitments\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected was not\nmaterial for 2024, $\n125million for 2023\nand $ 281million for\n2022. The firm\ngenerally calculates\nthe fair value of\nloans and lending\ncommitments for which\nthe fair value option\nis elected by\ndiscounting future\ncash flows at a rate\nwhich incorporates the\ninstrument-specific\ncredit spreads. For\nfloating-rate loans\nand lending\ncommitments,\nsubstantially all\nchanges in fair value\nare attributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads, whereas for\nfixed-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nchanges in fair value\nare also attributable\nto changes in interest\nrates.\n                                       \n  182    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things,\nfacilitate client activities, invest excess\ncash, acquire securities to cover short\npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings with\nthe same settlement date are presented on a\nnet-by-counterparty basis when such\ntransactions meet certain settlement criteria\nand are subject to netting agreements.\nInterest on collateralized agreements, which\nis included in interest income, and\ncollateralized financings, which is included\nin interest expense, is recognized over the\nlife of the transaction. See Note 23 for\nfurther information about interest income and\ninterest expense. Resale and Repurchase\nAgreements A resale agreement is a transaction\nin which the firm purchases financial\ninstruments from a seller, typically in\nexchange for cash, and simultaneously enters\ninto an agreement to resell the same or\nsubstantially the same financial instruments\nto the seller at a stated price plus accrued\ninterest at a future date. A repurchase\nagreement is a transaction in which the firm\nsells financial instruments to a buyer,\ntypically in exchange for cash, and\nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same\nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a\nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale\nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d) involve the legal transfer of\nownership of financial instruments, they are\naccounted for as financing arrangements\nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the\nmaturity of the agreement. The financial\ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and\nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations, and\ninvestment-grade sovereign obligations. The\nfirm receives financial instruments purchased\nunder resale agreements and makes delivery of\nfinancial instruments sold under repurchase\nagreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the\nfirm monitors the market value of these\nfinancial instruments on a daily basis, and\ndelivers or obtains additional collateral due\nto changes in the market value of the\nfinancial instruments, as appropriate. For\nresale agreements, the firm typically requires\ncollateral with a fair value approximately\nequal to the carrying value of the relevant\nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRepurchase agreements and substantially all\nresale agreements are recorded at fair value\nunder the fair value option. See Note 5 for\nfurther information about repurchase and\nresale agreements. Securities Borrowed and\nLoaned Transactions In a securities borrowed\ntransaction, the firm borrows securities from\na counterparty in exchange for cash or\nsecurities. When the firm returns the\nsecurities, the counterparty returns the cash\nor securities. Interest is generally paid\nperiodically over the life of the transaction.\nIn a securities loaned transaction, the firm\nlends securities to a counterparty in exchange\nfor cash or securities. When the counterparty\nreturns the securities, the firm returns the\ncash or securities posted as collateral.\nInterest is generally paid periodically over\nthe life of the transaction. In a transaction\nwhere the firm lends securities and receives\nsecurities that can be delivered or pledged as\ncollateral, the firm recognizes the securities\nreceived within securities borrowed and the\nobligation to return those securities within\nsecurities loaned in the consolidated balance\nsheets. The firm receives securities borrowed\nand makes delivery of securities loaned. To\nmitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these securities on a\ndaily basis, and delivers or obtains\nadditional collateral due to changes in the\nmarket value of the securities, as\nappropriate. For securities borrowed\ntransactions, the firm typically requires\ncollateral with a fair value approximately\nequal to the carrying value of the securities\nborrowed transaction. Securities borrowed and\nloaned within FICC financing are recorded at\nfair value under the fair value option. See\nNote 5 for further information about\nsecurities borrowed and loaned accounted for\nat fair value. Substantially all of the\nsecurities borrowed and loaned within Equities\nfinancing are recorded based on the amount of\ncash collateral advanced or received plus\naccrued interest. The firm also reviews such\nsecurities borrowed to determine if an\nallowance for credit losses should be recorded\nby taking into consideration the fair value of\ncollateral received. As these agreements\ngenerally can be terminated on demand, they\nexhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes\nin interest rates. Therefore, the carrying\nvalue of such agreements approximates fair\nvalue. As these agreements are not accounted\nfor at fair value, they are not included in\nthe firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and\n5. Had these agreements been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, they would have\nbeen classified in level 2 as of both December\n2024 and December 2023.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    183  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These\nother secured\nfinancings include: \u2022\nLiabilities of CIEs\nand consolidated VIEs;\n\u2022 Transfers of assets\naccounted for as\nfinancings rather than\nsales (e.g., pledged\ncommodities, bank\nloans and mortgage\nwhole loans); and \u2022\nOther structured\nfinancing\narrangements. Other\nsecured financings\nincluded nonrecourse\narrangements.\nNonrecourse other\nsecured financings\nwere $ 3.74billion as\nof December 2024 and $\n5.57billion as of\nDecember 2023. The\nfirm has elected to\napply the fair value\noption to\nsubstantially all\nother secured\nfinancings because the\nuse of fair value\neliminates non-\neconomic volatility in\nearnings that would\narise from using\ndifferent measurement\nattributes. See Note 5\nfor further\ninformation about\nother secured\nfinancings that are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue.

When\nassessing goodwill for impairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment can be made to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not\nthat the estimated fair value of a reporting\nunit is less than its carrying value. If the\nresults of the qualitative assessment are not\nconclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is\nperformed. Alternatively, a quantitative\ngoodwill test can be performed without\nperforming a qualitative assessment. The\nquantitative goodwill test compares the\nestimated fair value of each reporting unit\nwith its carrying value (including goodwill\nand identifiable intangible assets). If the\nreporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value exceeds\nits carrying value, goodwill is not impaired.\nAn impairment is recognized if the estimated\nfair value of a reporting unit is less than\nits carrying value and any such impairment is\nincluded in depreciation and amortization.\n\nWhen performing a quantitative goodwill test,\nthe estimated fair value of each reporting\nunit is based on valuation techniques the firm\nbelieves market participants would use to\nvalue these reporting units. Estimated fair\nvalues are generally derived from utilizing a\nrelative value technique, which applies\nobservable price-to-earnings multiples or\nprice-to-book multiples of comparable\ncompetitors to the reporting units\u2019 net\nearnings or net book value, or a discounted\ncash flow valuation approach, for reporting\nunits with businesses in early stages of\ndevelopment. The carrying value of each\nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and represents the\nestimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity\nrequired to support the activities of the\nreporting unit under currently applicable\nregulatory capital requirements. During the\nthird quarter of 2024, in connection with the\nplanned sale of the firm\u2019s seller financing\nloan portfolio, the firm performed a\nquantitative goodwill test and determined that\nthe goodwill associated with Transaction\nbanking and other was impaired, and\naccordingly, recorded a $ 14million\nimpairment. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the\nfirm performed its annual assessment of\ngoodwill for impairment, for each of its\nreporting units with goodwill, by performing a\nqualitative assessment. Multiple factors were\nassessed with respect to each of these\nreporting units to determine whether it was\nmore likely than not that the estimated fair\nvalue of each of those reporting units was\nless than its carrying value. The firm\nconsidered the following factors in the\nqualitative annual assessment: \u2022 Performance\nIndicators. During 2024, the firm\u2019s net\nrevenues, efficiency ratio (total operating\nexpenses divided by total net revenues),\ndiluted earnings per common share (EPS),\nreturn on average common shareholders\u2019 equity\nand book value per common share all improved\nfrom 2023 and from 2022 (when a quantitative\ntest was last performed). Within the reporting\nunits with goodwill, there continued to be\nsolid fundamentals underlying our businesses,\nwhere the firm continued to maintain industry\nleadership positions and execute on strategic\ngoals. \u2022 Macroeconomic Indicators. Despite\nbroad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns,\nthe global economy continued to grow in 2024.\n\u2022 Firm and Industry Events. There were no\nevents, entity-specific or otherwise, that\nwould have had a significant negative impact\non the valuation of the firm\u2019s reporting units\nwith goodwill. \u2022 Fair Value Indicators. Fair\nvalue indicators for both the firm and its\npeers have generally improved since the annual\nassessment performed in 2023 and from 2022\n(when a quantitative test was last performed).\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    187  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

that an asset\u2019s or asset\ngroup\u2019s carrying value may not be fully\nrecoverable. To the extent the carrying value\nof an asset or asset group exceeds the\nprojected undiscounted cash flows expected to\nresult from the use and eventual disposal of\nthe asset or asset group, the firm determines\nthe asset or asset group is impaired and\nrecords an impairment equal to the difference\nbetween the estimated fair value and the\ncarrying value of the asset or asset group. In\naddition, the firm will recognize an\nimpairment prior to the sale of an asset or\nasset group if the carrying value of the asset\nor asset group exceeds its estimated fair\nvalue.Other than as noted above, there were no\nmaterial impairments or write-downs during\neach of 2024, 2023 and 2022. Operating Lease\nRight-of-Use Assets The firm enters into\noperating leases for real estate, office\nequipment and other assets, substantially all\nof which are used in connection with its\noperations. For leases longer than one year,\nthe firm recognizes a right-of-use asset\nrepresenting the right to use the underlying\nasset for the lease term, and a lease\nliability representing the liability to make\npayments. The lease term is generally\ndetermined based on the contractual maturity\nof the lease. For leases where the firm has\nthe option to terminate or extend the lease,\nan assessment of the likelihood of exercising\nthe option is incorporated into the\ndetermination of the lease term. Such\nassessment is initially performed at the\ninception of the lease and is updated if\nevents occur that impact the original\nassessment. An operating lease right-of-use\nasset is initially determined based on the\noperating lease liability, adjusted for\ninitial direct costs, lease incentives and\namounts paid at or prior to lease\ncommencement. This amount is then amortized\nover the lease term.Right-of-use assets and\noperating lease liabilities recognized (in\nnon-cash transactions for leases entered into\nor assumed) by the firm were $ 167million for\n2024, $ 333million for 2023 and $ 256million\nfor 2022. See Note 15 for information about\noperating lease liabilities. For leases where\nthe firm will derive no economic benefit from\nleased space that it has vacated or where the\nfirm has shortened the term of a lease when\nspace is no longer needed, the firm will\nrecord an impairment or accelerated\namortization of right-of-use assets.There were\nno material impairments or accelerated\namortizations during each of 2024, 2023 and\n2022.\n                                       \n  188    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See\nNote 17 for further\ninformation about\nthese investments.\nNote 16.\nSecuritization\nActivities The firm\nsecuritizes\nresidential and\ncommercial mortgages,\ncorporate bonds, loans\nand other types of\nfinancial assets by\nselling these assets\nto securitization\nvehicles (e.g.,\ntrusts, corporate\nentities and limited\nliability companies)\nor through a\nresecuritization. The\nfirm acts as\nunderwriter of the\nbeneficial interests\nthat are sold to\ninvestors. The firm\u2019s\nresidential mortgage\nsecuritizations are\nprimarily in\nconnection with\ngovernment agency\nsecuritizations. The\nfirm accounts for a\nsecuritization as a\nsale when it has\nrelinquished control\nover the transferred\nfinancial assets.\nPrior to\nsecuritization, the\nfirm generally\naccounts for assets\npending transfer at\nfair value and\ntherefore does not\ntypically recognize\nsignificant gains or\nlosses upon the\ntransfer of assets.\nNet revenues from\nunderwriting\nactivities are\nrecognized in\nconnection with the\nsales of the\nunderlying beneficial\ninterests to\ninvestors. The firm\ngenerally receives\ncash in exchange for\nthe transferred assets\nbut may also have\ncontinuing involvement\nwith the transferred\nfinancial assets,\nincluding ownership of\nbeneficial interests\nin securitized\nfinancial assets,\nprimarily in the form\nof debt instruments.\nThe firm may also\npurchase senior or\nsubordinated\nsecurities issued by\nsecuritization\nvehicles (which are\ntypically VIEs) in\nconnection with\nsecondary market-\nmaking activities.\n\nThe primary risks\nincluded in beneficial\ninterests and other\ninterests from the\nfirm\u2019s continuing\ninvolvement with\nsecuritization\nvehicles are the\nperformance of the\nunderlying collateral,\nthe position of the\nfirm\u2019s investment in\nthe capital structure\nof the securitization\nvehicle and the market\nyield for the\nsecurity.

The firm\u2019s variable\ninterests in VIEs include senior and\nsubordinated debt; loans and lending\ncommitments; limited and general partnership\ninterests; preferred and common equity;\nderivatives that may include foreign currency,\nequity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and\ncertain of the fees the firm receives from\ninvestment funds. Certain interest rate,\nforeign currency and credit derivatives the\nfirm enters into with VIEs are not variable\ninterests because they create, rather than\nabsorb, risk. VIEs generally finance the\npurchase of assets by issuing debt and equity\nsecurities that are either collateralized by\nor indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The\ndebt and equity securities issued by a VIE may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. The firm\u2019s involvement with\nVIEs includes securitization of financial\nassets, as described in Note 16, and\ninvestments in and loans to other types of\nVIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the\nfirm\u2019s consolidation policies, including the\ndefinition of a VIE. VIE Consolidation\nAnalysis The enterprise with a controlling\nfinancial interest in a VIE is known as the\nprimary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE.\nThe firm determines whether it is the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis\nthat principally considers: \u2022 Which variable\ninterest holder has the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly\nimpact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; \u2022 Which\nvariable interest holder has the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s purpose\nand design, including the risks the VIE was\ndesigned to create and pass through to its\nvariable interest holders; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s capital\nstructure; \u2022 The terms between the VIE and its\nvariable interest holders and other parties\ninvolved with the VIE; and \u2022 Related-party\nrelationships. The firm reassesses its\nevaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when\ncertain reconsideration events occur. The firm\nreassesses its determination of whether it is\nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and\ncircumstances.\n\nVIE Activities The firm is principally\ninvolved with VIEs through the following\nbusiness activities: Mortgage-Backed VIEs. The\nfirm sells residential and commercial mortgage\nloans and securities to mortgage-backed VIEs\nand may retain beneficial interests in the\nassets sold to these VIEs. The firm purchases\nand sells beneficial interests issued by\nmortgage-backed VIEs in connection with\nmarket-making activities. In addition, the\nfirm may enter into derivatives with certain\nof these VIEs, primarily interest rate swaps,\nwhich are typically not variable interests.\nThe firm generally enters into derivatives\nwith other counterparties to mitigate its\nrisk. Tax Credit and Other Investing VIEs .\nThe firm makes equity investments in VIEs that\ninvest in qualified affordable housing and\nrenewable energy projects designed to generate\na return through the realization of tax\ncredits and related tax benefits. The firm\nalso purchases equity and debt securities\nissued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold\nreal estate, performing and nonperforming\ndebt, distressed loans and equity securities.\nIn addition, the firm makes equity investments\nin certain investment fund VIEs it manages and\nis entitled to receive fees from these VIEs.\nThe firm generally does not sell assets to, or\nenter into derivatives with, these VIEs.\nCorporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs.\nThe firm structures VIEs that issue notes to\nclients, purchases and sells beneficial\ninterests issued by corporate debt and other\nasset-backed VIEs in connection with market-\nmaking activities, and makes loans to VIEs\nthat warehouse corporate debt. Certain of\nthese VIEs synthetically create the exposure\nfor the beneficial interests they issue by\nentering into credit derivatives with the\nfirm, rather than purchasing the underlying\nassets. In addition, the firm may enter into\nderivatives, such as total return swaps, with\ncertain corporate debt and other asset-backed\nVIEs, under which the firm pays the VIE a\nreturn due to the beneficial interest holders\nand receives the return on the collateral\nowned by the VIE. The collateral owned by\nthese VIEs is primarily other asset-backed\nloans and securities. The firm may be removed\nas the total return swap counterparty and may\nenter into derivatives with other\ncounterparties to mitigate its risk related to\nthese swaps. The firm may sell assets to the\ncorporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs it\nstructures.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    195  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nPrincipal-Protected\nNote VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs\nown portfolios of\nassets, principally\nwith exposure to hedge\nfunds. Substantially\nall of the principal\nprotection on the\nnotes issued by these\nVIEs is provided by\nthe asset portfolio\nrebalancing that is\nrequired under the\nterms of the notes.\nThe firm enters into\ntotal return swaps\nwith these VIEs under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE the return due\nto the principal-\nprotected note holders\nand receives the\nreturn on the assets\nowned by the VIE. The\nfirm may enter into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk. The\nfirm also obtains\nfunding through these\nVIEs.

See the\ntables in\n\u201cCommitments\u201d above\nfor a summary of the\nfirm\u2019s commitments.\n\u2022 The carrying value for derivatives included\nderivative assets of $ 464million as of\nDecember 2024 and $ 359million as of December\n2023, and derivative liabilities of $\n4.00billion as of December 2024 and $\n5.60billion as of December 2023.\n\nDerivative Guarantees. The firm enters into\nvarious derivatives that meet the definition\nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including\nwritten equity and commodity put options,\nwritten currency contracts and interest rate\ncaps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives\nare risk managed together with derivatives\nthat do not meet the definition of a\nguarantee, and therefore the amounts in the\ntable above do not reflect the firm\u2019s overall\nrisk related to derivative activities.\nDisclosures about derivatives are not required\nif they may be cash settled and the firm has\nno basis to conclude it is probable that the\ncounterparties held the underlying instruments\nat the inception of the contract. The firm has\nconcluded that these conditions have been met\nfor certain large, internationally active\ncommercial and investment bank counterparties,\ncentral clearing counterparties, hedge funds\nand certain other counterparties. Accordingly,\nthe firm has not included such contracts in\nthe table above. See Note 7 for information\nabout credit derivatives that meet the\ndefinition of a guarantee, which are not\nincluded in the table above. Derivatives are\naccounted for at fair value and therefore the\ncarrying value is considered the best\nindication of payment/performance risk for\nindividual contracts. However, the carrying\nvalues in the table above exclude the effect\nof counterparty and cash collateral netting.\nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees .\nSecurities lending and clearing guarantees\ninclude the indemnifications and guarantees\nthat the firm provides in its capacity as an\nagency lender and in its capacity as a\nsponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. As an agency lender, the firm\nindemnifies most of its securities lending\ncustomers against losses incurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not return securities and\nthe collateral held is insufficient to cover\nthe market value of the securities\nborrowed.The maximum payout of such\nindemnifications was $ 10.62billion as of\nDecember 2024 and $ 14.19billion as of\nDecember 2023. Collateral held by the lenders\nin connection with securities lending\nindemnifications was $ 11.02 billionas of\nDecember 2024 and $ 14.63 billionas of\nDecember 2023. Because the contractual nature\nof these arrangements requires the firm to\nobtain collateral with a market value that\nexceeds the value of the securities lent to\nthe borrower, there is minimal performance\nrisk associated with these indemnifications.\n                                       \n  200    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nAs a sponsoring member of the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the\nperformance of its sponsored member clients to\nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in\nconnection with certain resale and repurchase\nagreements. To minimize potential losses on\nsuch guarantees, the firm obtains a security\ninterest in the collateral that the sponsored\nclient placed with the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on\nsuch guarantees is minimal. The maximum payout\non this guarantee was $ 47.44billion as of\nDecember 2024 and $ 14.60billion as of\nDecember 2023. The related collateral held was\n$ 46.96 billionas of December 2024 and $ 14.69\nbillionas of December 2023. Other Financial\nGuarantees . In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm provides other financial\nguarantees of the obligations of third parties\n(e.g., standby letters of credit and other\nguarantees to enable clients to complete\ntransactions and fund-related guarantees).\nThese guarantees represent obligations to make\npayments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed\nparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a\ncontractual arrangement with that\nbeneficiary.Other financial guarantees also\ninclude a guarantee that the firm has provided\nto the Government of Malaysia that it will\nreceive, by August 2025, at least $ 1.4billion\nin assets and proceeds from assets seized by\ngovernmental authorities around the world\nrelated to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a\nsovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In\nconnection with this guarantee, the firm\nagreed to make a one-time interim payment of $\n250million towards the $ 1.4billion if the\nGovernment of Malaysia did not receive at\nleast $ 500million in assets and proceeds by\nAugust 2022. The firm does not believe that\nany interim payment is required. Any amounts\npaid by the firm would, in any event, be\nsubject to reimbursement in the event the\nassets and proceeds received by the Government\nof Malaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed $\n1.4billion. On October 11, 2023, the firm\nfiled a demand for arbitration alleging that\nthe Government of Malaysia had, as of August\n2022, recovered assets and proceeds well in\nexcess of $ 500million; it had recovered\nsubstantial additional assets and proceeds\nthat should be credited against the guarantee;\nand it had not used all reasonable efforts to\nrecover other assets and proceeds that cou ld\nbe credited against the guarantee. On November\n8, 2023, the Government of Malaysia filed a\nresponse to the firm\u2019s demand for arbitration\nand on June 10, 2024, filed an application for\na partial award to immediately enforce the\ninterim payment (plus interest). On July 24,\n2024, the arbitral tribunal rejected that\napplication. Final determinations on all\nremaining issues, including any subsequent\nenforcement of the interim payment, are to be\nmade at a final hearing. The arbitral process\nis ongoing. See Note 27 for further\ninformation about matters related to 1MDB.\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The\nfirm has established trusts, including Goldman\nSachs Capital I, Goldman Sachs Capital II and\nGoldman Sachs Capital III (the Trusts), and\nother entities, for the limited purpose of\nissuing securities to third parties, lending\nthe proceeds to the firm and entering into\ncontractual arrangements with the firm and\nthird parties related to this purpose. The\nfirm does not consolidate these entities. See\nNotes 14 and 19 for further information about\nthe transactions involving the Trusts. The\nfirm effectively provides for the full and\nunconditional guarantee of the securities\nissued by these entities. Timely payment by\nthe firm of amounts due to these entities\nunder the guarantee, borrowing, preferred\nstock and related contractual arrangements\nwill be sufficient to cover payments due on\nthe securities issued by these entities. No\nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the\nsecurities of the Trusts. Management believes\nthat it is unlikely that any circumstances\nwill occur, such as nonperformance on the part\nof paying agents or other service providers,\nthat would make it necessary for the firm to\nmake payments related to these entities other\nthan those required under the terms of the\nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and\nrelated contractual arrangements and in\nconnection with certain expenses incurred by\nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of\nService Providers. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees\ncertain service providers, such as clearing\nand custody agents, trustees and\nadministrators, against specified potential\nlosses in connection with their acting as an\nagent of, or providing services to, the firm\nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses\narising from its custodial role or caused by\nacts or omissions of third-party service\nproviders, including sub-custodians and third-\nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has\nthe right to seek indemnification from these\nthird-party service providers for certain\nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In\naddition, the firm is a member of payment,\nclearing and settlement networks, as well as\nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of\nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of\nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In\nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear\nand settle transactions entered into by\nclients with other brokerage firms. The firm\u2019s\nobligations in respect of such transactions\nare secured by the assets in the client\u2019s\naccount and proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the firm\non behalf of the client. In connection with\njoint venture investments, the firm may issue\nloan guarantees under which it may be liable\nin the event of fraud, misappropriation,\nenvironmental liabilities and other matters\ninvolving the borrower.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    201  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nThe firm is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder these guarantees\nand indemnifications\nas this depends upon\nthe occurrence of\nfuture events,\nincluding an\nassessment of claims\nthat have not yet\noccurred. However,\nmanagement believes\nthat it is unlikely\nthe firm will have to\nmake any material\npayments under these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\nguarantees and\nindemnifications have\nbeen recognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both\nDecember 2024 and\nDecember 2023. Other\nRepresentations,\nWarranties and\nIndemnifications. The\nfirm provides\nrepresentations and\nwarranties to\ncounterparties in\nconnection with a\nvariety of commercial\ntransactions and\noccasionally\nindemnifies them\nagainst potential\nlosses caused by the\nbreach of those\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. The firm\nmay also provide\nindemnifications\nprotecting against\nchanges in or adverse\napplication of certain\nU.S. tax laws in\nconnection with\nordinary-course\ntransactions, such as\nsecurities issuances,\nborrowings or\nderivatives. In\naddition, the firm may\nprovide\nindemnifications to\nsome counterparties to\nprotect them in the\nevent additional taxes\nare owed or payments\nare withheld, due\neither to a change in\nor an adverse\napplication of certain\nnon-U.S. tax laws.\nThese\nindemnifications, as\nwell as\nindemnifications\nprovided by the firm\non other contractual\nor other obligations,\ngenerally are standard\ncontractual terms and\nare entered into in\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness. Generally,\nthere are no stated or\nnotional amounts\nincluded in these\nindemnifications, and\nthe contingencies\ntriggering the\nobligation to\nindemnify are not\nexpected to occur.\nFuture changes in tax\nlaws and how such laws\nwould apply to these\nindemnifications\ncannot be determined.\nTherefore, the firm is\nunable to develop an\nestimate of the\nmaximum payout under\nthese guarantees and\nindemnifications.\nHowever, management\nbelieves that it is\nunlikely the firm will\nhave to make any\nmaterial payments\nunder these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\narrangements have been\nrecognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both\nDecember 2024 and\nDecember 2023.\nGuarantees of\nSubsidiaries. Group\nInc. is the entity\nthat fully and\nunconditionally\nguarantees the\nsecurities issued by\nGS Finance Corp., a\nwholly-owned finance\nsubsidiary of the\nfirm. Group Inc. has\nguaranteed the payment\nobligations of Goldman\nSachs & Co. LLC\n(GS&Co.), GS Bank USA\nand Goldman Sachs\nParis Inc. et Cie,\nsubject to certain\nexceptions. Group Inc.\nalso guarantees many\nof the obligations of\nits other consolidated\nsubsidiaries on a\ntransaction-by-\ntransaction basis, as\nnegotiated with\ncounterparties.

Regulation\nand Capital Adequacy\nThe FRB is the primary\nregulator of Group\nInc., a bank holding\ncompany under the U.S.\nBank Holding Company\nAct of 1956 and a\nfinancial holding\ncompany under\namendments to this\nAct. The firm is\nsubject to\nconsolidated\nregulatory capital\nrequirements which are\ncalculated in\naccordance with the\nregulations of the FRB\n(Capital Framework).\nThe capital\nrequirements are\nexpressed as risk-\nbased capital and\nleverage ratios that\ncompare measures of\nregulatory capital to\nrisk-weighted assets\n(RWAs), average assets\nand off-balance sheet\nexposures. Failure to\ncomply with these\ncapital requirements\nwould result in\nrestrictions being\nimposed by the firm\u2019s\nregulators and could\nlimit the firm\u2019s\nability to repurchase\nshares, pay dividends\nand make certain\ndiscretionary\ncompensation payments.\nThe firm\u2019s capital\nlevels are also\nsubject to qualitative\njudgments by the\nregulators about\ncomponents of capital,\nrisk weightings and\nother factors.\nFurthermore, certain\nof the firm\u2019s\nsubsidiaries are\nsubject to separate\nregulations and\ncapital requirements.\nCapital Framework The\nregulations under the\nCapital Framework are\nlargely based on the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\u2019s\n(Basel Committee)\ncapital framework for\nstrengthening\ninternational capital\nstandards (Basel III)\nand also implement\ncertain provisions of\nthe U.S. Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection\nAct. Under the Capital\nFramework, the firm is\nan \u201cAdvanced\napproaches\u201d banking\norganization and has\nbeen designated as a\nglobal systemically\nimportant bank\n(G-SIB). The Capital\nFramework includes the\nminimum risk-based\ncapital and the\ncapital conservation\nbuffer requirements.\nThe buffer must\nconsist entirely of\ncapital that qualifies\nas Common Equity Tier\n1 (CET1) capital. The\nfirm calculates its\nCET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total\ncapital ratios in\naccordance with both\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules. Each of the\nratios calculated\nunder the Standardized\nand Advanced Capital\nRules must meet its\nrespective capital\nrequirements. Under\nthe Capital Framework,\nthe firm is also\nsubject to leverage\nrequirements which\nconsist of a minimum\nTier 1 leverage ratio\nand a minimum\nsupplementary leverage\nratio (SLR), as well\nas the SLR buffer.\n\nConsolidated\nRegulatory Capital\nRequirements Risk-\nBased Capital Ratios.\nThe table below\npresents the risk-\nbased capital\nrequirements.\n                                              \n                   Standar\u2026          Advanc\u2026  \n  As of                                       \n  Decemb\u2026                                     \n  2024                                        \n  CET1                                        \n  capital    13.7  %           10.0  %        \n  ratio                                       \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capital    15.2  %           11.5  %        \n  ratio                                       \n  Total                                       \n  capital    17.2  %           13.5  %        \n  ratio                                       \n  As of                                       \n  Decemb\u2026                                     \n  2023                                        \n  CET1                                        \n  capital    13.0  %           10.0  %        \n  ratio                                       \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capital    14.5  %           11.5  %        \n  ratio                                       \n  Total                                       \n  capital    16.5  %           13.5  %        \n  ratio                                       \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\n\u2022 As of both December 2024 and December 2023,\nunder both the Standardized and Advanced\nCapital Rules, the CET1 capital ratio\nrequirement includes a minimum of 4.5%, the\nTier 1 capital ratio requirement includes a\nminimum of 6.0% and the Total capital ratio\nrequirement includes a minimum of 8.0%. These\nrequirements also include the capital\nconservation buffer requirements, consisting\nof the G-SIB surcharge (Method 2) of 3.0% and\nthe countercyclical capital buffer, which the\nFRB has set to zero percent. In addition, the\ncapital conservation buffer requirements\ninclude the stress capital buffer (SCB) of\n6.2% as of December 2024 and 5.5% as of\nDecember 2023 under the Standardized Capital\nRules and a buffer of 2.5% as of both December\n2024 and December 2023 under the Advanced\nCapital Rules.\n\n\u2022 The G-SIB surcharge is updated annually\nbased on financial data from the prior year\nand is generally applicable for the following\nyear. The G-SIB surcharge is calculated using\ntwo methodologies, the higher of which is\nreflected in the firm\u2019s risk-based capital\nrequirements.

RWAs are calculated in accordance with\nboth the Standardized and Advanced Capital\nRules. Credit Risk Credit RWAs are calculated\nbased on measures of exposure, which are then\nrisk weighted under the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules: \u2022 The Standardized\nCapital Rules apply prescribed risk-weights,\nwhich depend largely on the type of\ncounterparty. The exposure measures for\nderivatives and securities financing\ntransactions are based on specific formulas\nwhich take certain factors into consideration.\n\u2022 Under the Advanced Capital Rules, the firm\ncomputes risk-weights for wholesale and retail\ncredit exposures in accordance with the\nAdvanced Internal Ratings-Based approach. The\nexposure measures for derivatives and\nsecurities financing transactions are computed\nutilizing internal models. \u2022 For both\nStandardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the\nrisk-weights for securitizations and equities\nare based on specific required formulaic\napproaches.\n\nMarket Risk RWAs for market risk in accordance\nwith the Standardized and Advanced Capital\nRules are generally consistent. Market RWAs\nare calculated based on measures of exposure\nwhich include the following: \u2022 Value-at-Risk\n(VaR) is the potential loss in value of\ntrading assets and liabilities, as well as\ncertain investments, loans, and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities accounted for\nat fair value, due to adverse market movements\nover a defined time horizon with a specified\nconfidence level. For both risk management\npurposes and regulatory capital calculations,\nthe firm uses a single VaR model which\ncaptures risks, including those related to\ninterest rates, equity prices, currency rates\nand commodity prices. However, VaR used for\nrisk management purposes differs from VaR used\nfor regulatory capital requirements\n(regulatory VaR) due to differences in time\nhorizons, confidence levels and the scope of\npositions on which VaR is calculated. For risk\nmanagement purposes, a 95% one-dayVaR is used,\nwhereas for regulatory capital requirements, a\n99% 10-dayVaR is used to determine Market RWAs\nand a 99% one-dayVaR is used to determine\nregulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the\ndaily net revenues used to determine risk\nmanagement VaR exceptions (i.e., comparing the\ndaily net revenues to the VaR measure\ncalculated as of the end of the prior business\nday) include intraday activity, whereas the\nCapital Framework requires that intraday\nactivity be excluded from daily net revenues\nwhen calculating regulatory VaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity includes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are more likely than not to be\npositive by their nature. As a result, there\nmay be differences in the number of VaR\nexceptions and the amount of daily net\nrevenues calculated for regulatory VaR\ncompared to the amounts calculated for risk\nmanagement VaR.

If not utilized, the U.S. federal,\nthe state and local, and foreign net operating\nloss carryforwards will begin to expire in\n2025. If these carryforwards expire, they will\nnot have a material impact on the firm\u2019s\nresults of operations. As of December 2024,\nthe firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $\n405million in connection with foreign tax\ncredit carryforwards and a related valuation\nallowance of $ 289million.

As of\nDecember 2024, the firm had deferred tax\nassets of $ 365million in connection with\nforeign capital loss carryforwards and a\nvaluation allowance of $ 346million related to\nthese capital loss carryforwards. The\nvaluation allowance increased by $ 86million\nduring 2024 and $ 409million during 2023. The\nincreases in both 2024 and 2023 were primarily\ndue to an increase in deferred tax assets from\nwhich the firm does not expect to realize any\nbenefit.

These\nbusiness segments are determined and organized\nbased on products and services provided, and\nthe types of customers and counterparties\nserved. See Note 1 for a description of the\nfirm\u2019s business segments. The firm\u2019s chief\noperating decision maker (CODM) is its\npresident and chief operating officer. The\nCODM makes operating decisions, assesses the\nperformance of, and allocates resources to,\nthe firm\u2019s operating segments principally\nbased on the total net revenues of the\nsegments, revenues net of provision for credit\nlosses, total operating expenses, pre-tax\nearnings, net earnings applicable to common\nshareholders and the return on average common\nequity to assess the performance of the\nsegments. The CODM evaluates segment operating\nperformance against the firm\u2019s targets and\nindustry metrics and considers the current and\nfuture business and operating environment. The\naccounting policies used to prepare the\noperating results and other metrics for the\nsegments are consistent with those described\nin Note 3. The following provides a\ndescription of the primary components of the\nfirm\u2019s segment results disclosed in the table\nbelow. \u2022 The firm fully allocates its\nrevenues, expenses, assets and shareholders\u2019\nequity to the firm\u2019s threebusiness segments. \u2022\nRevenues and expenses directly associated with\neach segment are included in determining pre-\ntax earnings for the respective segment.\n\n\u2022 Net revenues in the firm\u2019s segments include\nallocations of interest income and expense\nbased on the funding generated by, or the\nfunding and liquidity requirements of the\nrespective segments. Net interest is included\nin segment net revenues as it is consistent\nwith how management assesses segment\nperformance. \u2022 Expenses not directly\nassociated with specific segments are\nallocated among the business segments based on\nan estimate of support provided to each\nsegment. \u2022 Compensation and benefits expenses\nin the firm\u2019s segments reflect, among other\nfactors, the overall performance of the firm,\nas well as the performance of individual\nbusinesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in\none segment of the firm\u2019s business may be\nsignificantly affected by the performance of\nthe firm\u2019s other business segments. \u2022 Certain\nassets (including allocations of global core\nliquid assets and cash, and secured client\nfinancing), not directly associated with\nspecific segments are generally allocated\namong the business segments based on the\nfunding and liquidity requirements of the\nsegments. \u2022 Common shareholders\u2019 equity and\npreferred stock dividends are allocated to\neach segment based on the estimated amount of\nequity required to support the activities of\nthe segment under relevant regulatory capital\nrequirements. \u2022 Net earnings for each segment\nis calculated by applying the firmwide tax\nrate to each segment\u2019s pre-tax earnings. \u2022\nManagement believes that this allocation\nprovides a reasonable representation of each\nsegment\u2019s contribution to consolidated net\nearnings to common, return on average common\nequity and total assets. Due to the integrated\nnature of these segments, estimates and\njudgments are made in allocating these assets,\nrevenues and expenses. Transactions between\nsegments are based on specific criteria or\napproximate third-party rates.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    215  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These\nactivities expose the\nfirm to many different\nindustries and\ncounterparties, and\nmay also subject the\nfirm to a\nconcentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular central\nbank, counterparty,\nborrower or issuer,\nincluding sovereign\nissuers, or to a\nparticular\nclearinghouse or\nexchange. The firm\nseeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by\nactively monitoring\nexposures and\nobtaining collateral\nfrom counterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm\nconsiders when\ndetermining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts. Netting and\ncollateral agreements\npermit the firm to\noffset receivables and\npayables with such\ncounterparties and/or\nenable the firm to\nobtain collateral on\nan upfront or\ncontingent basis.\nThe table below\npresents the credit\nconcentrations\nincluded in trading\ncash instruments and\ninvestments.\n                                              \n  $ in          As of                         \n  mill\u2026       Decemb\u2026  2024             2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S.                                        \n  gove\u2026                                       \n  and      $  389,148        $  260,5\u2026        \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  obli\u2026                                       \n  Perc\u2026                                       \n  of             23.2  %          15.9  %     \n  total                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Non-\u2026                                       \n  gove\u2026                                       \n  and      $   74,496        $  90,681        \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  obli\u2026                                       \n  Perc\u2026                                       \n  of              4.4  %           5.5  %     \n  total                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n                                              \nIn addition, the firm\nhad $ 151.84billion as\nof December 2024 and $\n206.07billion as of\nDecember 2023 of cash\ndeposits held at\ncentral banks\n(included in cash and\ncash equivalents), of\nwhich $ 105.78billion\nas of December 2024\nand $ 105.66billion as\nof December 2023 was\nheld at the Federal\nReserve.\nAs of both December\n2024 and December\n2023, the firm did not\nhave credit exposure\nto any other\ncounterparty that\nexceeded 2% of total\nassets.\nCollateral obtained by\nthe firm related to\nderivative assets is\nprincipally cash and\nis held by the firm or\na third-party\ncustodian.

Note 27.\nLegal Proceedings The firm is involved in a\nnumber of judicial, regulatory and arbitration\nproceedings (including those described below)\nconcerning matters arising in connection with\nthe conduct of the firm\u2019s businesses. Many of\nthese proceedings are in early stages, and\nmany of these cases seek an indeterminate\namount of damages. Under ASC 450, an event is\n\u201creasonably possible\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the\nfuture event or events occurring is more than\nremote but less than likely\u201d and an event is\n\u201cremote\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the future event or\nevents occurring is slight.\u201d Thus, references\nto the upper end of the range of reasonably\npossible loss for cases in which the firm is\nable to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible loss mean the upper end of the range\nof loss for cases for which the firm believes\nthe risk of loss is more than slight.\n\nWith respect to matters described below for\nwhich management has been able to estimate a\nrange of reasonably possible loss where (i)\nactual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an\namount of money damages, (ii) the firm is\nbeing, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers\nin a securities offering and is not being\nindemnified by a party that the firm believes\nwill pay the full amount of any judgment, or\n(iii) the purchasers are demanding that the\nfirm repurchase securities, management has\nestimated the upper end of the range of\nreasonably possible loss based on (a) in the\ncase of (i), the amount of money damages\nclaimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the\ndifference between the initial sales price of\nthe securities that the firm sold in such\noffering and the estimated lowest subsequent\nprice of such securities prior to the action\nbeing commenced and (c) in the case of (iii),\nthe price that purchasers paid for the\nsecurities less the estimated value, if any,\nas of December 2024 of the relevant\nsecurities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and\n(iii), taking into account any other factors\nbelieved to be relevant to the particular\nmatter or matters of that type. As of the date\nhereof, the firm has estimated the upper end\nof the range of reasonably possible aggregate\nloss for such matters and for any other\nmatters described below where management has\nbeen able to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible aggregate loss to be approximately $\n1.7billion in excess of the aggregate reserves\nfor such matters. Management is generally\nunable to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible loss for matters other than those\nincluded in the estimate above, including\nwhere (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have\nnot claimed an amount of money damages, except\nin those instances where management can\notherwise determine an appropriate amount,\n(ii) matters are in early stages, (iii)\nmatters relate to regulatory investigations or\nreviews, except in those instances where\nmanagement can otherwise determine an\nappropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty\nas to the likelihood of a class being\ncertified or the ultimate size of the class,\n(v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of\npending appeals or motions, (vi) there are\nsignificant factual issues to be resolved,\nand/or (vii) there are novel legal issues\npresented. For example, the firm\u2019s potential\nliabilities with respect to the investigations\nand reviews described below in \u201cRegulatory\nInvestigations and Reviews and Related\nLitigation\u201d generally are not included in\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible\nloss. However, management does not believe,\nbased on currently available information, that\nthe outcomes of such other matters will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the firm\u2019s\nfinancial condition, though the outcomes could\nbe material to the firm\u2019s operating results\nfor any particular period, depending, in part,\nupon the operating results for such period.\n                                       \n  218    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

On November 1, 2018,\nthe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed\na criminal information and guilty plea by Tim\nLeissner, a former participating managing\ndirector of the firm, and an indictment\nagainst Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing\ndirector of the firm. On August 28, 2018,\nLeissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork of conspiring to launder money and to\nviolate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct\u2019s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal\naccounting controls provisions. Ng was charged\nwith conspiring to launder money and to\nviolate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery and internal\naccounting controls provisions, and on April\n8, 2022, Ng was found guilty on all counts\nfollowing a trial. On August 18, 2020, the\nfirm announced that it entered into a\nsettlement agreement with the Government of\nMalaysia to resolve the criminal and\nregulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving\nthe firm, which includes a guarantee that the\nGovernment of Malaysia receives at least $\n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets\nseized by governmental authorities around the\nworld related to 1MDB. See Note 18 for further\ninformation about this guarantee, including\nrelated arbitration proceedings. On October\n22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached\nsettlements of governmental and regulatory\ninvestigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ,\nthe SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the Financial\nConduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation\nAuthority, the Singapore Attorney General\u2019s\nChambers, the Singapore Commercial Affairs\nDepartment, the Monetary Authority of\nSingapore and the Hong Kong Securities and\nFutures Commission. Group Inc. entered into a\nthree-year deferred prosecution agreement with\nthe DOJ, in which a charge against the firm,\none count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA,\nwas filed and was later dismissed on May 6,\n2024 in accordance with the agreement. In\naddition, GS Malaysia pleaded guilty to one\ncount of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, and\nwas sentenced on June 9, 2021. In May 2021,\nthe U.S. Department of Labor granted the firm\na five-year exemption to maintain its status\nas a qualified professional asset manager\n(QPAM). On December 20, 2018, a putative\nsecurities class action lawsuit was filed in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York against Group Inc. and\ncertain former officers of the firm alleging\nviolations of the anti-fraud provisions of the\nExchange Act with respect to Group Inc.\u2019s\ndisclosures and public statements concerning\n1MDB and seeking unspecified damages. The\nplaintiff filed the second amended complaint\non October 28, 2019. On June 28, 2021, the\ncourt dismissed the claims against one of the\nindividual defendants but denied the\ndefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss with respect to\nthe firm and the remaining individual\ndefendants. On August 4, 2023, the plaintiff\nfiled a third amended complaint. On September\n29, 2023, the plaintiff moved for class\ncertification. On April 5, 2024, the\nMagistrate Judge recommended that the\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification be\ngranted in part and denied in part. On May 3,\n2024, the defendants filed objections to the\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation\nwith the district court.

On\nNovember 23, 2020, the court granted in part\nand denied in part defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss the complaint in the first action and\ndenied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint in the second action.

The firm\nalso provides certain\nbenefits to former or\ninactive employees\nprior to retirement.\nDefined Benefit\nPension Plans and\nPostretirement Plans\nEmployees of certain\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries\nparticipate in various\ndefined benefit\npension plans. These\nplans generally\nprovide benefits based\non years of credited\nservice and a\npercentage of eligible\ncompensation. The firm\nmaintains a defined\nbenefit pension plan\nfor certain U.K.\nemployees. As of April\n2008, the U.K. defined\nbenefit plan was\nclosed to new\nparticipants and\nfrozen for existing\nparticipants as of\nMarch 31, 2016. The\nnon-U.S. plans do not\nhave a material impact\non the firm\u2019s\nconsolidated results\nof operations. The\nfirm also maintains a\ndefined benefit\npension plan for\nsubstantially all U.S.\nemployees hired prior\nto November 1, 2003.\nAs of November 2004,\nthis plan was closed\nto new participants\nand frozen for\nexisting participants.\nIn addition, the firm\nmaintains unfunded\npostretirement benefit\nplans that provide\nmedical and life\ninsurance for eligible\nretirees and their\ndependents covered\nunder these programs.\nThese plans do not\nhave a material impact\non the firm\u2019s\nconsolidated results\nof operations. The\nfirm recognizes the\nfunded status of its\ndefined benefit\npension and\npostretirement plans,\nmeasured as the\ndifference between the\nfair value of the plan\nassets and the benefit\nobligation, in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets.As of December\n2024, other assets\nincluded $ 73million\n(related to overfunded\npension plans) and\nother liabilities\nincluded $ 344million\nrelated to these\nplans. As of December\n2023, other assets\nincluded $ 93million\n(related to overfunded\npension plans) and\nother liabilities\nincluded $ 449million\nrelated to these\nplans. Defined\nContribution Plans The\nfirm contributes to\nemployer-sponsored\nU.S. and non-U.S.\ndefined contribution\nplans. The firm\u2019s\ncontribution to these\nplans was $ 382million\nfor 2024, $ 377million\nfor 2023 and $\n378million for 2022.\n                                       \n  230    Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Share-\nbased awards that do not require future\nservice (i.e., vested awards, including awards\ngranted to retirement-eligible employees) are\nexpensed immediately. Share-based awards that\nrequire future service are amortized over the\nrelevant service period. Forfeitures are\nrecorded when they occur. Cash dividend\nequivalents paid on RSUs are generally charged\nto retained earnings. If RSUs that require\nfuture service are forfeited, the related\ndividend equivalents originally charged to\nretained earnings are reclassified to\ncompensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues\nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of\nshare-based awards. In limited cases, as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements,\nthe firm may cash settle share-based awards\naccounted for as equity instruments. For these\nawards, additional paid-in capital is adjusted\nto the extent of the difference between the\nvalue of the award at the time of cash\nsettlement and the grant-date value of the\naward. The tax effect related to the\nsettlement of share-based awards and payments\nof dividend equivalents is recorded in income\ntax benefit or expense. Stock Incentive Plan\nThe firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The\nGoldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock\nIncentive Plan (2021) (2021 SIP), which\nprovides for grants of RSUs, restricted stock,\ndividend equivalent rights, incentive stock\noptions, nonqualified stock options, stock\nappreciation rights, and other share-based\nawards, each of which may be subject to terms\nand conditions, including performance or\nmarket conditions. On April 29, 2021,\nshareholders approved the 2021 SIP. The 2021\nSIP is a successor to several predecessor\nstock incentive plans, the first of which was\nadopted on April 30, 1999, and each of which\nwas approved by the firm\u2019s shareholders.\n\nAs of December 2024, 55.7million shares were\navailable to be delivered pursuant to awards\ngranted under the 2021 SIP. If any shares of\ncommon stock underlying awards granted under\nthe 2021 SIP or awards granted under\npredecessor stock incentive plans are not\ndelivered because such awards are forfeited,\nterminated or canceled, or if shares of common\nstock underlying such awards are surrendered\nor withheld to satisfy any obligation of the\ngrantee (including taxes), those shares will\nbecome available to be delivered pursuant to\nawards granted under the 2021 SIP. Shares\navailable to be delivered under the 2021 SIP\nalso are subject to adjustment for certain\nevents or changes in corporate structure as\nprovided under the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is\nscheduled to terminate on the date of the 2025\nAnnual Meeting of Shareholders. Restricted\nStock Units The firm grants RSUs (including\nRSUs subject to performance or market\nconditions) to employees, which are generally\nvalued based on the closing price of the\nunderlying shares on the date of grant, after\ntaking into account a liquidity discount for\nany applicable post-vesting and delivery\ntransfer restrictions. The value of equity\nawards also considers the impact of material\nnon-public information, if any, that the firm\nexpects to make available shortly following\ngrant. RSUs not subject to performance or\nmarket conditions generally vest and\nunderlying shares of common stock are\ndelivered (net of required withholding tax)\nover a three-yearperiod as outlined in the\napplicable award agreements. Award agreements\ngenerally provide that vesting is accelerated\nin certain circumstances, such as on\nretirement, death, disability and, in certain\ncases, conflicted employment. Delivery of the\nunderlying shares of common stock is\nconditioned on the grantees satisfying certain\nvesting and other requirements outlined in the\naward agreements. RSUs that are subject to\nperformance or market conditions generally are\nsettled after the end of a three- to five-\nyearperiod. For awards that are subject to\nperformance or market conditions, generally\nthe final award is adjusted from zeroup to\n150% of the original grant based on the extent\nto which those conditions are satisfied.\nDividend equivalents that accrue on these\nawards are paid when the awards settle.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K    231  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.
