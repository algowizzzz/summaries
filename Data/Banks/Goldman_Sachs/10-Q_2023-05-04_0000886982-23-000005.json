AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nConsolidation The firm consolidates entities\nin which the firm has a controlling financial\ninterest. The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a\nvoting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)\nthe total equity investment at risk is\nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity\nholders have the power to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the\nentity and the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting\ninterest entity is ownership of a majority\nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest\nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable\nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that\nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a\nvoting interest entity. The firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when\nthe firm has a variable interest or interests\nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive\nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for\nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method\nInvestments. When the firm does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity\nbut can exert significant influence over the\nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair\nvalue by electing the fair value option\navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant\ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns\n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstance common stock. In certain cases, the\nfirm applies the equity method of accounting\nto new investments that are strategic in\nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s\nprincipal business activities, when the firm\nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or\nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less\nsignificant. See Note 8 for further\ninformation about equity-method investments.\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed\ninvestment funds with third-party investors.\nThese funds are typically organized as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies\nfor which the firm acts as general partner or\nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a\nmajority of the economic interests in these\nfunds. These funds are usually voting interest\nentities and generally are not consolidated\nbecause third-party investors typically have\nrights to terminate the funds or to remove the\nfirm as general partner or manager.\nInvestments in these funds are generally\nmeasured at net asset value (NAV) and are\nincluded in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and\n22 for further information about investments\nin funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of\nthese consolidated financial statements\nrequires management to make certain estimates\nand assumptions, the most important of which\nrelate to fair value measurements, the\nallowance for credit losses on loans and\nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,\naccounting for goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, provisions for losses that\nmay arise from litigation and regulatory\nproceedings (including governmental\ninvestigations), and accounting for income\ntaxes. These estimates and assumptions are\nbased on the best available information, but\nactual results could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition Financial Assets and\nLiabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and\nliabilities and certain investments are\ncarried at fair value either under the fair\nvalue option or in accordance with other U.S.\nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to\naccount for certain of its loans and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nby electing the fair value option. The fair\nvalue of a financial instrument is the amount\nthat would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked\nto bid prices and financial liabilities are\nmarked to offer prices. Fair value\nmeasurements do not include transaction costs.\nFair value gains or losses are generally\nincluded in market making or other principal\ntransactions. See Note 4 for further\ninformation about fair value measurements.\n                                           \n  7    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with\nclients for services, such as investment\nbanking, investment management, and execution\nand clearing (contracts with clients), when\nthe performance obligations related to the\nunderlying transaction are completed. Revenues\nfrom contracts with clients represent\napproximately 45% of total non-interest\nrevenues for the three months ended March 2023\n(including approximately 85% of investment\nbanking revenues, approximately 95% of\ninvestment management revenues and all\ncommissions and fees), and approximately 40%\nof total non-interest revenues for the three\nmonths ended March 2022 (including\napproximately 80% of investment banking\nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment\nmanagement revenues and all commissions and\nfees). See Note 25 for information about net\nrevenues by business segment. Investment\nBanking Advisory. Fees from financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues when\nthe services related to the underlying\ntransaction are completed under the terms of\nthe assignment. Non-refundable deposits and\nmilestone payments in connection with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nin revenues upon completion of the underlying\ntransaction or when the assignment is\notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nwhen incurred and are included in transaction\nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such\nexpenses are included in investment banking\nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon\ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses\nassociated with underwriting assignments are\ngenerally deferred until the related revenue\nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise\nconcluded. Such expenses are included in\ntransaction based expenses for completed\nassignments. Investment Management The firm\nearns management fees and incentive fees for\ninvestment management services, which are\nincluded in investment management revenues.\nThe firm makes payments to brokers and\nadvisors related to the placement of the\nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),\nwhich are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily net asset value and are received\nmonthly. Management fees for hedge funds and\nseparately managed accounts are calculated as\na percentage of month-end net asset value and\nare generally received quarterly. Management\nfees for private equity funds are calculated\nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are received quarterly,\nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the\nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.\nDistribution fees paid by the firm are\ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net\nasset value or the committed capital. Such\nfees are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are\ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or\nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other\nperformance target. Incentive fees are\ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a\nfund. Fees that are based on performance over\na twelve-month period are subject to\nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment\nperformance over the life of the fund, future\ninvestment underperformance may require fees\npreviously distributed to the firm to be\nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned\nfrom a fund or separately managed account are\nrecognized when it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal of such fees will not\noccur, which is generally when such fees are\nno longer subject to fluctuations in the\nmarket value of investments held by the fund\nor separately managed account. Therefore,\nincentive fees recognized during the period\nmay relate to performance obligations\nsatisfied in previous periods.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    8  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nCommissions and Fees The firm earns\nsubstantially all commissions and fees from\nexecuting and clearing client transactions on\nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter (OTC) transactions.\nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides\nthird-party research services to clients in\nconnection with certain soft-dollar\narrangements. Third-party research costs\nincurred by the firm in connection with such\narrangements are presented net within\ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance\nObligations Remaining performance obligations\nare services that the firm has committed to\nperform in the future in connection with its\ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining\nperformance obligations are generally related\nto its financial advisory assignments and\ncertain investment management activities.\nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory\nassignments cannot be determined until the\noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s\ninvestment management activities, where fees\nare calculated based on the net asset value of\nthe fund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining\nperformance obligations cannot be determined\nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in\nthe market value of investments held by the\nfund or separately managed account. The firm\nis able to determine the future revenues\nassociated with management fees calculated\nbased on committed capital. As of March 2023,\nsubstantially all future net revenues\nassociated with such remaining performance\nobligations will be recognized through 2030.\nAnnual revenues associated with such\nperformance obligations average less than $\n300million through 2030. Transfers of\nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has\nrelinquished control over the assets\ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses\nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or\nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement with transferred\nfinancial assets are initially recognized at\nfair value. For transfers of financial assets\nthat are not accounted for as sales, the\nassets are generally included in trading\nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a\ncollateralized financing, with the related\ninterest expense recognized over the life of\nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about transfers of financial\nassets accounted for as collateralized\nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted\nfor as sales. Cash and Cash Equivalents The\nfirm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid\novernight deposits held in the ordinary course\nof business. Cash and cash equivalents\nincluded cash and due from banks of $\n8.20billion as of March 2023 and $ 7.87billion\nas of December 2022. Cash and cash equivalents\nalso included interest-bearing deposits with\nbanks of $ 221.13billion as of March 2023 and\n$ 233.96billion as of December 2022. The firm\nsegregates cash for regulatory and other\npurposes related to client activity. Cash and\ncash equivalents segregated for regulatory and\nother purposes were $ 20.08billion as of March\n2023 and $ 16.94billion as of December 2022.\nIn addition, the firm segregates securities\nfor regulatory and other purposes related to\nclient activity. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about segregated securities.\nCustomer and Other Receivables Customer and\nother receivables included receivables from\ncustomers and counterparties of $ 76.68billion\nas of March 2023 and $ 67.88billion as of\nDecember 2022, and receivables from brokers,\ndealers and clearing organizations of $\n67.95billion as of March 2023 and $\n67.57billion as of December 2022. Such\nreceivables primarily consist of collateral\nposted in connection with certain derivative\ntransactions, customer margin loans and\nreceivables resulting from unsettled\ntransactions. Substantially all of these\nreceivables are accounted for at amortized\ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,\nwhich generally approximates fair value. As\nthese receivables are not accounted for at\nfair value, they are not included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5.\nHad these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of\nboth March 2023 and December 2022. See Note 10\nfor further information about customer and\nother receivables accounted for at fair value\nunder the fair value option. Interest on\ncustomer and other receivables is recognized\nover the life of the transaction and included\nin interest income. Customer and other\nreceivables includes receivables from\ncontracts with clients and contract assets.\nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to\nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s\nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n3.15billion as of March 2023 and $ 3.01billion\nas of December 2022.

Customer and other\npayables are accounted for at cost plus\naccrued interest, which generally approximates\nfair value. As these payables are not\naccounted for at fair value, they are not\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 and 5. Had these payables been\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,\nsubstantially all would have been classified\nin level 2 as of both March 2023 and December\n2022. Interest on customer and other payables\nis recognized over the life of the transaction\nand included in interest expense. Offsetting\nAssets and Liabilities To reduce credit\nexposures on derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter\ninto master netting agreements or similar\narrangements (collectively, netting\nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such\ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a\ncontract with a counterparty that permits net\nsettlement of multiple transactions with that\ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of\ntermination rights by a non-defaulting party.\nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all\ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is\ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with\nrespect to its derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms\nof the related credit support agreements or\nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit\nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit\nsupport agreement grants the non-defaulting\nparty exercising termination rights the right\nto liquidate the collateral and apply the\nproceeds to any amounts owed. In order to\nassess enforceability of the firm\u2019s right of\nsetoff under netting and credit support\nagreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in\nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the\nagreement. Derivatives are reported on a net-\nby-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for derivative assets and\nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the\nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting\nagreement. Resale agreements and securities\nsold under agreements to repurchase\n(repurchase agreements) and securities\nborrowed and loaned transactions with the same\nsettlement date are presented on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis in the consolidated balance\nsheets when such transactions meet certain\nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements. In the consolidated balance\nsheets, derivatives are reported net of cash\ncollateral received and posted under\nenforceable credit support agreements, when\ntransacted under an enforceable netting\nagreement. In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and\nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not\nreported net of the related cash and\nsecurities received or posted as collateral.\nSee Note 11 for further information about\ncollateral received and pledged, including\nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See\nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about\noffsetting assets and liabilities. Share-Based\nCompensation The cost of employee services\nreceived in exchange for a share-based award\nis generally measured based on the grant-date\nfair value of the award. Share-based awards\nthat do not require future service (i.e.,\nvested awards, including awards granted to\nretirement-eligible employees) are expensed\nimmediately. Share-based awards that require\nfuture service are amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recorded when\nthey occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on\nrestricted stock units (RSUs) are generally\ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that\nrequire future service are forfeited, the\nrelated dividend equivalents originally\ncharged to retained earnings are reclassified\nto compensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues\nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of\nshare-based awards. In limited cases, as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements,\nthe firm may cash settle share-based\ncompensation awards accounted for as equity\ninstruments. For these awards, additional\npaid-in capital is adjusted to the extent of\nthe difference between the value of the award\nat the time of cash settlement and the grant-\ndate value of the award. The tax effects\nrelated to the settlement of share-based\nawards and payments of dividend equivalents\nare recorded in income tax benefit or expense.\nForeign Currency Translation Assets and\nliabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies\nare translated at rates of exchange prevailing\non the date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at\naverage rates of exchange for the period.\nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies\nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a\nnon-U.S. operation, when the functional\ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are\nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive\nincome.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    10  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value Measurements The fair value\nof a financial instrument is the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid\nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not\ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures\ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active\nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by\nreference to prices for similar instruments,\nquoted prices or recent transactions in less\nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or\nindependently sourced inputs, including, but\nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities,\nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding\nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference\nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower\ncould finance a given financial instrument\nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.\nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for\ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This\nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving\nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based\non the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In\nevaluating the significance of a valuation\ninput, the firm considers, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to\nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as\nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical,\nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.\nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are\nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values\nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial\nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain\nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and\nliabilities may require valuation adjustments\nthat a market participant would require to\narrive at fair value for factors, such as\ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments\nare generally based on market evidence.\nThe table below\npresents financial\nassets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value.\n                                              \n  $

Level 1 instruments include\nU.S. government obligations, most non-U.S.\ngovernment obligations, certain agency\nobligations, certain corporate debt\ninstruments, certain money market instruments\nand actively traded listed equities. These\ninstruments are valued using quoted prices for\nidentical unrestricted instruments in active\nmarkets. The firm defines active markets for\nequity instruments based on the average daily\ntrading volume both in absolute terms and\nrelative to the market capitalization for the\ninstrument. The firm defines active markets\nfor debt instruments based on both the average\ndaily trading volume and the number of days\nwith trading activity. Level 2. Level 2\ninstruments include certain non-U.S.\ngovernment obligations, most agency\nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and\nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,\nmost state and municipal obligations, most\nmoney market instruments, most other debt\nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed\nequities, certain private equities,\ncommodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be\nverified to quoted prices, recent trading\nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative\npricing sources with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency. Consideration is given to\nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor executable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Valuation\nadjustments are typically made to level 2\ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject\nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair\nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally\nbased on market evidence. Level 3. Level 3\ninstruments have one or more significant\nvaluation inputs that are not observable.\nAbsent evidence to the contrary, level 3\ninstruments are initially valued at\ntransaction price, which is considered to be\nthe best initial estimate of fair value.\nSubsequently, the firm uses other\nmethodologies to determine fair value, which\nvary based on the type of instrument.\nValuation inputs and assumptions are changed\nwhen corroborated by substantive observable\nevidence, including values realized on sales.\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments\nvary by instrument, but are generally based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques. The valuation\ntechniques and the nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair values of\neach type of level 3 instrument are described\nbelow: Loans and Securities Backed by\nCommercial Real Estate Loans and securities\nbacked by commercial real estate are directly\nor indirectly collateralized by a single\nproperty or a portfolio of properties, and may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. Significant inputs are\ngenerally determined based on relative value\nanalyses and include: \u2022 Market yields implied\nby transactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and changes in market\nindices, such as the CMBX (an index that\ntracks the performance of commercial mortgage\nbonds); \u2022 Transaction prices in both the\nunderlying collateral and instruments with the\nsame or similar underlying collateral; \u2022 A\nmeasure of expected future cash flows in a\ndefault scenario (recovery rates) implied by\nthe value of the underlying collateral, which\nis mainly driven by current performance of the\nunderlying collateral and capitalization\nrates. Recovery rates are expressed as a\npercentage of notional or face value of the\ninstrument and reflect the benefit of credit\nenhancements on certain instruments; and \u2022\nTiming of expected future cash flows\n(duration) which, in certain cases, may\nincorporate the impact of any loan\nforbearances and other unobservable inputs\n(e.g., prepayment speeds). Loans and\nSecurities Backed by Residential Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by residential\nreal estate are directly or indirectly\ncollateralized by portfolios of residential\nreal estate and may include tranches of\nvarying levels of subordination. Significant\ninputs are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons to instruments with similar\ncollateral and risk profiles. Significant\ninputs include: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets; \u2022\nTransaction prices in both the underlying\ncollateral and instruments with the same or\nsimilar underlying collateral; \u2022 Cumulative\nloss expectations, driven by default rates,\nhome price projections, residential property\nliquidation timelines, related costs and\nsubsequent recoveries; and \u2022 Duration, driven\nby underlying loan prepayment speeds and\nresidential property liquidation timelines.\n                                            \n  13    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks\nthe performance of corporate credit); \u2022\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions\nand, where the firm uses credit default swaps\nto value the related instrument, the cost of\nborrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n\u2022 Duration; and \u2022 Market and transaction\nmultiples for corporate debt instruments with\nconvertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities Equity securities consists\nof private equities. Recent third-party\ncompleted or pending transactions (e.g.,\nmerger proposals, debt restructurings, tender\noffers) are considered the best evidence for\nany change in fair value. When these are not\navailable, the following valuation\nmethodologies are used, as appropriate: \u2022\nIndustry multiples (primarily EBITDA and\nrevenue multiples) and public comparables; \u2022\nTransactions in similar instruments; \u2022\nDiscounted cash flow techniques; and \u2022 Third-\nparty appraisals. The firm also considers\nchanges in the outlook for the relevant\nindustry and financial performance of the\nissuer as compared to projected performance.\nSignificant inputs include: \u2022 Market and\ntransaction multiples; \u2022 Discount rates and\ncapitalization rates; and \u2022 For equity\nsecurities with debt-like features, market\nyields implied by transactions of similar or\nrelated assets, current performance and\nrecovery assumptions, and duration. Other\nTrading Cash Instruments, Investments and\nLoans The significant inputs to the valuation\nof other instruments, such as non-U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations, state and\nmunicipal obligations, and other loans and\ndebt obligations are generally determined\nbased on relative value analyses, which\nincorporate comparisons both to prices of\ncredit default swaps that reference the same\nor similar underlying instrument or entity and\nto other debt instruments for the same issuer\nfor which observable prices or broker\nquotations are available. Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices; \u2022 Current performance and recovery\nassumptions and, where the firm uses credit\ndefault swaps to value the related instrument,\nthe cost of borrowing the underlying reference\nobligation; and \u2022 Duration. Valuation\nTechniques and Significant Inputs for\nDerivatives The firm\u2019s level 2 and level 3\nderivatives are valued using derivative\npricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow\nmodels, correlation models and models that\nincorporate option pricing methodologies, such\nas Monte Carlo simulations). Price\ntransparency of derivatives can generally be\ncharacterized by product type, as described\nbelow. \u2022 Interest Rate. In general, the key\ninputs used to value interest rate derivatives\nare transparent, even for most long-dated\ncontracts. Interest rate swaps and options\ndenominated in the currencies of leading\nindustrialized nations are characterized by\nhigh trading volumes and tight bid/offer\nspreads. Interest rate derivatives that\nreference indices, such as an inflation index,\nor the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year\nswap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) are more\ncomplex, but the key inputs are generally\nobservable. \u2022 Credit. Price transparency for\ncredit default swaps, including both single\nnames and baskets of credits, varies by market\nand underlying reference entity or obligation.\nCredit default swaps that reference indices,\nlarge corporates and major sovereigns\ngenerally exhibit the most price transparency.\nFor credit default swaps with other\nunderliers, price transparency varies based on\ncredit rating, the cost of borrowing the\nunderlying reference obligations, and the\navailability of the underlying reference\nobligations for delivery upon the default of\nthe issuer. Credit default swaps that\nreference loans, asset-backed securities and\nemerging market debt instruments tend to have\nless price transparency than those that\nreference corporate bonds. In addition, more\ncomplex credit derivatives, such as those\nsensitive to the correlation between two or\nmore underlying reference obligations,\ngenerally have less price transparency.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    14  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\n\u2022 Currency. Prices for currency derivatives\nbased on the exchange rates of leading\nindustrialized nations, including those with\nlonger tenors, are generally transparent. The\nprimary difference between the price\ntransparency of developed and emerging market\ncurrency derivatives is that emerging markets\ntend to be only observable for contracts with\nshorter tenors. \u2022 Commodity. Commodity\nderivatives include transactions referenced to\nenergy (e.g., oil, natural gas and\nelectricity), metals (e.g., precious and base)\nand soft commodities (e.g., agricultural).\nPrice transparency varies based on the\nunderlying commodity, delivery location, tenor\nand product quality (e.g., diesel fuel\ncompared to unleaded gasoline). In general,\nprice transparency for commodity derivatives\nis greater for contracts with shorter tenors\nand contracts that are more closely aligned\nwith major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n\u2022 Equity. Price transparency for equity\nderivatives varies by market and underlier.\nOptions on indices and the common stock of\ncorporates included in major equity indices\nexhibit the most price transparency. Equity\nderivatives generally have observable market\nprices, except for contracts with long tenors\nor reference prices that differ significantly\nfrom current market prices. More complex\nequity derivatives, such as those sensitive to\nthe correlation between two or more individual\nstocks, generally have less price\ntransparency. Liquidity is essential to the\nobservability of all product types. If\ntransaction volumes decline, previously\ntransparent prices and other inputs may become\nunobservable. Conversely, even highly\nstructured products may at times have trading\nvolumes large enough to provide observability\nof prices and other inputs. Level 1. Level 1\nderivatives include short-term contracts for\nfuture delivery of securities when the\nunderlying security is a level 1 instrument,\nand exchange-traded derivatives if they are\nactively traded and are valued at their quoted\nmarket price. Level 2. Level 2 derivatives\ninclude OTC derivatives for which all\nsignificant valuation inputs are corroborated\nby market evidence and exchange-traded\nderivatives that are not actively traded\nand/or that are valued using models that\ncalibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC\nderivatives. The selection of a particular\nmodel to value a derivative depends on the\ncontractual terms of and specific risks\ninherent in the instrument, as well as the\navailability of pricing information in the\nmarket. For derivatives that trade in liquid\nmarkets, model selection does not involve\nsignificant management judgment because\noutputs of models can be calibrated to market-\nclearing levels. Valuation models require a\nvariety of inputs, such as contractual terms,\nmarket prices, yield curves, discount rates\n(including those derived from interest rates\non collateral received and posted as specified\nin credit support agreements for\ncollateralized derivatives), credit curves,\nmeasures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss\nseverity rates and correlations of such\ninputs. Significant inputs to the valuations\nof level 2 derivatives can be verified to\nmarket transactions, broker or dealer\nquotations or other alternative pricing\nsources with reasonable levels of price\ntransparency. Consideration is given to the\nnature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or\nexecutable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Level 3 . Level 3\nderivatives are valued using models which\nutilize observable level 1 and/or level 2\ninputs, as well as unobservable level 3\ninputs. The significant unobservable inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s level 3 derivatives\nare described below. \u2022 For level 3 interest\nrate and currency derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include correlations of\ncertain currencies and interest rates (e.g.,\nthe correlation between Euro inflation and\nEuro interest rates) and specific interest\nrate and currency volatilities. \u2022 For level 3\ncredit derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs include illiquid credit spreads and\nupfront credit points, which are unique to\nspecific reference obligations and reference\nentities, and recovery rates. \u2022 For level 3\ncommodity derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include volatilities for\noptions with strike prices that differ\nsignificantly from current market prices and\nprices or spreads for certain products for\nwhich the product quality or physical location\nof the commodity is not aligned with benchmark\nindices. \u2022 For level 3 equity derivatives,\nsignificant unobservable inputs generally\ninclude equity volatility inputs for options\nthat are long-dated and/or have strike prices\nthat differ significantly from current market\nprices. In addition, the valuation of certain\nstructured trades requires the use of level 3\ncorrelation inputs, such as the correlation of\nthe price performance of two or more\nindividual stocks or the correlation of the\nprice performance for a basket of stocks to\nanother asset class, such as commodities.\n                                            \n  15    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level\n3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and\nlevel 2 inputs to reflect observable market\nchanges and any resulting gains and losses are\nclassified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are\nchanged when corroborated by evidence, such as\nsimilar market transactions, third-party\npricing services and/or broker or dealer\nquotations or other empirical market data. In\ncircumstances where the firm cannot verify the\nmodel value by reference to market\ntransactions, it is possible that a different\nvaluation model could produce a materially\ndifferent estimate of fair value. See Note 5\nfor further information about significant\nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of\nlevel 3 derivatives. Valuation Adjustments.\nValuation adjustments are integral to\ndetermining the fair value of derivative\nportfolios and are used to adjust the mid-\nmarket valuations produced by derivative\npricing models to the exit price valuation.\nThese adjustments incorporate bid/offer\nspreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and\nfunding valuation adjustments, which account\nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in\nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative\nportfolios. The firm also makes funding\nvaluation adjustments to collateralized\nderivatives where the terms of the agreement\ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge\ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are\ngenerally used when calibrating valuation\nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In\naddition, for derivatives that include\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm\nmakes model or exit price adjustments to\naccount for the valuation uncertainty present\nin the transaction. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Other Financial Assets\nand Liabilities at Fair Value In addition to\ntrading cash instruments, derivatives, and\ncertain investments and loans, the firm\naccounts for certain of its other financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value under the\nfair value option. Such instruments include\nresale and repurchase agreements; certain\nsecurities borrowed and loaned transactions;\ncertain customer and other receivables,\nincluding certain margin loans; certain time\ndeposits, including structured certificates of\ndeposit, which are hybrid financial\ninstruments; substantially all other secured\nfinancings, including transfers of assets\naccounted for as financings; certain unsecured\nshort- and long-term borrowings, substantially\nall of which are hybrid financial instruments;\nand certain other assets and liabilities.\nThese instruments are generally valued based\non discounted cash flow techniques, which\nincorporate inputs with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency, and are generally\nclassified in level 2 because the inputs are\nobservable. Valuation adjustments may be made\nfor liquidity and for counterparty and the\nfirm\u2019s credit quality. The significant inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s other financial\nassets and liabilities are described below.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements and\nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of resale\nand repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and interest rates. Customer and Other\nReceivables. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of receivables are interest rates,\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and funding spreads. Deposits. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of time\ndeposits are interest rates and the amount and\ntiming of future cash flows. The inputs used\nto value the embedded derivative component of\nhybrid financial instruments are consistent\nwith the inputs used to value the firm\u2019s other\nderivative instruments described above. See\nNote 7 for further information about\nderivatives and Note 13 for further\ninformation about deposits. Other Secured\nFinancings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other secured financings are the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, funding spreads and the\nfair value of the collateral delivered by the\nfirm (determined using the amount and timing\nof expected future cash flows, market prices,\nmarket yields and recovery assumptions). See\nNote 11 for further information about other\nsecured financings. Unsecured Short- and Long-\nTerm Borrowings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of unsecured short- and long-term\nborrowings are the amount and timing of\nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,\nthe credit spreads of the firm and commodity\nprices for prepaid commodity transactions. The\ninputs used to value the embedded derivative\ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are\nconsistent with the inputs used to value the\nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described\nabove. See Note 7 for further information\nabout derivatives and Note 14 for further\ninformation about borrowings. Other Assets and\nLiabilities. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other assets and liabilities are\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, market yields,\nvolatility and correlation inputs.

An average\ngreater than the median indicates that the\nmajority of inputs are below the average. For\nexample, the difference between the average\nand the median for credit spreads indicates\nthat the majority of the inputs fall in the\nlower end of the range. \u2022 The ranges, averages\nand medians of these inputs are not\nrepresentative of the appropriate inputs to\nuse when calculating the fair value of any one\nderivative. For example, the highest\ncorrelation for interest rate derivatives is\nappropriate for valuing a specific interest\nrate derivative but may not be appropriate for\nvaluing any other interest rate derivative.\nAccordingly, the ranges of inputs do not\nrepresent uncertainty in, or possible ranges\nof, fair value measurements of level 3\nderivatives. \u2022 Interest rates, currencies and\nequities derivatives are valued using option\npricing models, credit derivatives are valued\nusing option pricing, correlation and\ndiscounted cash flow models, and commodities\nderivatives are valued using option pricing\nand discounted cash flow models. \u2022 The fair\nvalue of any one instrument may be determined\nusing multiple valuation techniques. For\nexample, option pricing models and discounted\ncash flow models are typically used together\nto determine fair value. Therefore, the level\n3 balance encompasses both of these\ntechniques. \u2022 Correlation within currencies\nand equities includes cross-product type\ncorrelation. \u2022 Natural gas spread represents\nthe spread per million British thermal units\nof natural gas. \u2022 Oil spread represents the\nspread per barrel of oil and refined products.\n\u2022 Electricity price represents the price per\nmegawatt hour of electricity. Range of\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs. The following\nprovides information about the ranges of\nsignificant unobservable inputs used to value\nthe firm\u2019s level 3 derivative instruments: \u2022\nCorrelation. Ranges for correlation cover a\nvariety of underliers both within one product\ntype (e.g., equity index and equity single\nstock names) and across product types (e.g.,\ncorrelation of an interest rate and a\ncurrency), as well as across regions.\nGenerally, cross-product type correlation\ninputs are used to value more complex\ninstruments and are lower than correlation\ninputs on assets within the same derivative\nproduct type. \u2022 Volatility. Ranges for\nvolatility cover numerous underliers across a\nvariety of markets, maturities and strike\nprices. For example, volatility of equity\nindices is generally lower than volatility of\nsingle stocks. \u2022 Credit spreads, upfront\ncredit points and recovery rates. The ranges\nfor credit spreads, upfront credit points and\nrecovery rates cover a variety of underliers\n(index and single names), regions, sectors,\nmaturities and credit qualities (high-yield\nand investment-grade). The broad range of this\npopulation gives rise to the width of the\nranges of significant unobservable inputs. \u2022\nCommodity prices and spreads. The ranges for\ncommodity prices and spreads cover variability\nin products, maturities and delivery\nlocations. Sensitivity of Fair Value\nMeasurement to Changes in Significant\nUnobservable Inputs. The following is a\ndescription of the directional sensitivity of\nthe firm\u2019s level 3 fair value measurements to\nchanges in significant unobservable inputs, in\nisolation, as of each period-end: \u2022\nCorrelation. In general, for contracts where\nthe holder benefits from the convergence of\nthe underlying asset or index prices (e.g.,\ninterest rates, credit spreads, foreign\nexchange rates, inflation rates and equity\nprices), an increase in correlation results in\na higher fair value measurement. \u2022 Volatility.\nIn general, for purchased options, an increase\nin volatility results in a higher fair value\nmeasurement. \u2022 Credit spreads, upfront credit\npoints and recovery rates. In general, the\nfair value of purchased credit protection\nincreases as credit spreads or upfront credit\npoints increase or recovery rates decrease.\nCredit spreads, upfront credit points and\nrecovery rates are strongly related to\ndistinctive risk factors of the underlying\nreference obligations, which include reference\nentity-specific factors, such as leverage,\nvolatility and industry, market-based risk\nfactors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity\nof the underlying reference obligation, and\nmacroeconomic conditions. \u2022 Commodity prices\nand spreads. In general, for contracts where\nthe holder is receiving a commodity, an\nincrease in the spread (price difference from\na benchmark index due to differences in\nquality or delivery location) or price results\nin a higher fair value measurement. Due to the\ndistinctive nature of each of the firm\u2019s level\n3 derivatives, the interrelationship of inputs\nis not necessarily uniform within each product\ntype.\n                                            \n  21    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Therefore, the\nlevel 3 balance\nencompasses both of\nthese techniques.\n\nLevel 3 Rollforward.\nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level 3\ninvestments.\n                                              \n                Three                         \n               Months                         \n  $ in          Ended                         \n  mill\u2026         March  2023             2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Begi\u2026    $   16,942        $  13,902        \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  Net                                         \n  real\u2026           102               66        \n  gain\u2026                                       \n  Net                                         \n  unre\u2026           -76           -1,116        \n  gain\u2026                                       \n  Purc\u2026           213              277        \n  Sales          -236              -87        \n  Sett\u2026          -356             -594        \n  Tran\u2026                                       \n  into            860            2,087        \n  level                                       \n  3                                           \n  Tran\u2026                                       \n  out                                         \n  of             -216             -367        \n  level                                       \n  3                                           \n  Endi\u2026    $   17,233        $  14,168        \n  bala\u2026                                       \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\n\u2022 Changes in fair value are presented for all\ninvestments that are classified in level 3 as\nof the end of the period.\n\n\u2022 Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates to\ninvestments that were still held at period-\nend.\n\n\u2022 Transfers between levels of the fair value\nhierarchy are reported at the beginning of the\nreporting period in which they occur.

See Note 23\nfor further\ninformation about\ninterest income and\ninterest expense.\n\u2022 Gains/(losses)\nincluded in market\nmaking are primarily\nrelated to the firm\u2019s\ntrading assets and\nliabilities, including\nboth derivative and\nnon-derivative\nfinancial instruments.\n\u2022 Gains/(losses) are\nnot representative of\nthe manner in which\nthe firm manages its\nbusiness activities\nbecause many of the\nfirm\u2019s market-making\nand client\nfacilitation\nstrategies utilize\nfinancial instruments\nacross various product\ntypes. Accordingly,\ngains or losses in one\nproduct type\nfrequently offset\ngains or losses in\nother product types.\nFor example, most of\nthe firm\u2019s longer-term\nderivatives across\nproduct types are\nsensitive to changes\nin interest rates and\nmay be economically\nhedged with interest\nrate swaps. Similarly,\na significant portion\nof the firm\u2019s trading\ncash instruments and\nderivatives across\nproduct types has\nexposure to foreign\ncurrencies and may be\neconomically hedged\nwith foreign currency\ncontracts.\nNote 7. Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nDerivative Activities Derivatives are\ninstruments that derive their value from\nunderlying asset prices, indices, reference\nrates and other inputs, or a combination of\nthese factors. Derivatives may be traded on an\nexchange (exchange-traded) or they may be\nprivately negotiated contracts, which are\nusually referred to as OTC derivatives.\nCertain of the firm\u2019s OTC derivatives are\ncleared and settled through central clearing\ncounterparties (OTC-cleared), while others are\nbilateral contracts between two counterparties\n(bilateral OTC).\n\nMarket Making. As a market maker, the firm\nenters into derivative transactions to provide\nliquidity to clients and to facilitate the\ntransfer and hedging of their risks. In this\nrole, the firm typically acts as principal and\nis required to commit capital to provide\nexecution, and maintains market-making\npositions in response to, or in anticipation\nof, client demand. Risk Management. The firm\nalso enters into derivatives to actively\nmanage risk exposures that arise from its\nmarket-making and investing and financing\nactivities. The firm\u2019s holdings and exposures\nare hedged, in many cases, on either a\nportfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed\nto an instrument-by-instrument basis. The\noffsetting impact of this economic hedging is\nreflected in the same business segment as the\nrelated revenues. In addition, the firm may\nenter into derivatives designated as hedges\nunder U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to\nmanage interest rate exposure of certain\nfixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits\nand certain U.S. government securities\nclassified as available-for-sale, foreign\nexchange risk of certain available-for-sale\nsecurities and the net investment in certain\nnon-U.S. operations. The firm enters into\nvarious types of derivatives, including: \u2022\nFutures and Forwards. Contracts that commit\ncounterparties to purchase or sell financial\ninstruments, commodities or currencies in the\nfuture. \u2022 Swaps. Contracts that require\ncounterparties to exchange cash flows, such as\ncurrency or interest payment streams. The\namounts exchanged are based on the specific\nterms of the contract with reference to\nspecified rates, financial instruments,\ncommodities, currencies or indices. \u2022 Options.\nContracts in which the option purchaser has\nthe right, but not the obligation, to purchase\nfrom or sell to the option writer financial\ninstruments, commodities or currencies within\na defined time period for a specified price.\nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or\nreceivable for derivative assets and\nliabilities for a given counterparty) when a\nlegal right of setoff exists under an\nenforceable netting agreement (counterparty\nnetting). Derivatives are accounted for at\nfair value, net of cash collateral received or\nposted under enforceable credit support\nagreements (cash collateral netting).\nDerivative assets are included in trading\nassetsand derivative liabilities are included\nin trading liabilities. Realized and\nunrealized gains and losseson derivatives not\ndesignated as hedges are included in market\nmaking (for derivatives included in Fixed\nIncome, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and\nEquities within Global Banking & Markets), and\nother principal transactions (for derivatives\nincluded in Investment banking fees and Other\nwithin Global Banking & Markets, as well as\nderivatives in Asset & Wealth Management) in\nthe consolidated statements of earnings. For\nboth the three months ended March 2023 and\nMarch 2022, substantially all of the firm\u2019s\nderivatives were included in Global Banking &\nMarkets.\n                                            \n  31    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Credit\nDerivatives The firm\nenters into a broad\narray of credit\nderivatives to\nfacilitate client\ntransactions and to\nmanage the credit risk\nassociated with\nmarket-making and\ninvesting and\nfinancing activities.\nCredit derivatives are\nactively managed based\non the firm\u2019s net risk\nposition. Credit\nderivatives are\ngenerally individually\nnegotiated contracts\nand can have various\nsettlement and payment\nconventions. Credit\nevents include failure\nto pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of\nindebtedness,\nrestructuring,\nrepudiation and\ndissolution of the\nreference entity. The\nfirm enters into the\nfollowing types of\ncredit derivatives: \u2022\nCredit Default Swaps.\nSingle-name credit\ndefault swaps protect\nthe buyer against the\nloss of principal on\none or more bonds,\nloans or mortgages\n(reference\nobligations) in the\nevent the issuer of\nthe reference\nobligations suffers a\ncredit event. The\nbuyer of protection\npays an initial or\nperiodic premium to\nthe seller and\nreceives protection\nfor the period of the\ncontract. If there is\nno credit event, as\ndefined in the\ncontract, the seller\nof protection makes no\npayments to the buyer.\nIf a credit event\noccurs, the seller of\nprotection is required\nto make a payment to\nthe buyer, calculated\naccording to the terms\nof the contract. \u2022\nCredit Options. In a\ncredit option, the\noption writer assumes\nthe obligation to\npurchase or sell a\nreference obligation\nat a specified price\nor credit spread. The\noption purchaser buys\nthe right, but does\nnot assume the\nobligation, to sell\nthe reference\nobligation to, or\npurchase it from, the\noption writer. The\npayments on credit\noptions depend either\non a particular credit\nspread or the price of\nthe reference\nobligation.\n                                            \n  33    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\n\u2022 Credit Indices,\nBaskets and Tranches.\nCredit derivatives may\nreference a basket of\nsingle-name credit\ndefault swaps or a\nbroad-based index. If\na credit event occurs\nin one of the\nunderlying reference\nobligations, the\nprotection seller pays\nthe protection buyer.\nThe payment is\ntypically a pro-rata\nportion of the\ntransaction\u2019s total\nnotional amount based\non the underlying\ndefaulted reference\nobligation. In certain\ntransactions, the\ncredit risk of a\nbasket or index is\nseparated into various\nportions (tranches),\neach having different\nlevels of\nsubordination. The\nmost junior tranches\ncover initial defaults\nand once losses exceed\nthe notional amount of\nthese junior tranches,\nany excess loss is\ncovered by the next\nmost senior tranche. \u2022\nTotal Return Swaps. A\ntotal return swap\ntransfers the risks\nrelating to economic\nperformance of a\nreference obligation\nfrom the protection\nbuyer to the\nprotection seller.\nTypically, the\nprotection buyer\nreceives a floating\nrate of interest and\nprotection against any\nreduction in fair\nvalue of the reference\nobligation, and the\nprotection seller\nreceives the cash\nflows associated with\nthe reference\nobligation, plus any\nincrease in the fair\nvalue of the reference\nobligation. The firm\neconomically hedges\nits exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a\nparticular written\ncredit derivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default. As\nof March 2023, written\ncredit derivatives had\na total gross notional\namount of $\n608.59billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n664.76billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 56.17billion. As\nof December 2022,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n528.31billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n579.14billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 50.83billion.

Equity\nsecurities and debt\ninstruments, at fair\nvalue include\ninvestments in funds\nthat are measured at\nNAV of the investment\nfund.

Substantially\nall of the firm\u2019s\ninvestments in funds\nat NAV consist of\ninvestments in firm-\nsponsored private\nequity, credit, real\nestate and hedge funds\nwhere the firm co-\ninvests with third-\nparty investors.\nPrivate equity funds\nprimarily invest in a\nbroad range of\nindustries worldwide,\nincluding leveraged\nbuyouts,\nrecapitalizations,\ngrowth investments and\ndistressed\ninvestments. Credit\nfunds generally invest\nin loans and other\nfixed income\ninstruments and are\nfocused on providing\nprivate high-yield\ncapital for leveraged\nand management buyout\ntransactions,\nrecapitalizations,\nfinancings,\nrefinancings,\nacquisitions and\nrestructurings for\nprivate equity firms,\nprivate family\ncompanies and\ncorporate issuers.\nReal estate funds\ninvest globally,\nprimarily in real\nestate companies, loan\nportfolios, debt\nrecapitalizations and\nproperty. Private\nequity, credit and\nreal estate funds are\nclosed-end funds in\nwhich the firm\u2019s\ninvestments are\ngenerally not eligible\nfor redemption.\nDistributions will be\nreceived from these\nfunds as the\nunderlying assets are\nliquidated or\ndistributed, the\ntiming of which is\nuncertain. The firm\nalso invests in hedge\nfunds, primarily\nmulti-disciplinary\nhedge funds that\nemploy a fundamental\nbottom-up investment\napproach across\nvarious asset classes\nand strategies. The\nfirm\u2019s investments in\nhedge funds primarily\ninclude interests\nwhere the underlying\nassets are illiquid in\nnature, and proceeds\nfrom redemptions will\nnot be received until\nthe underlying assets\nare liquidated or\ndistributed, the\ntiming of which is\nuncertain.\n\nThe firm's investments\nin funds at NAV\nincludes investments\nin \u201ccovered funds\u201d as\ndefined in the Volcker\nRule of the U.S. Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act (Dodd-\nFrank Act). To achieve\nconformance with the\ncovered fund\nprovisions of the\nVolcker Rule by July\n2022, the firm\nrestructured certain\nlegacy \u201cilliquid\nfunds\u201d (as defined by\nthe Volcker Rule) to\nbe non-covered funds\nas liquidating trusts.\nHowever, based on\nrecent interpretations\nof the covered fund\nprovisions of the\nVolcker Rule, the firm\nwas required to seek\nan additional\nextension from the\nBoard of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB) to bring\nthese funds into\nconformance. The FRB\ngranted the firm an\nadditional extension\nto July 2023. If the\nfirm does not conform\nsuch funds by July\n2023, the firm will be\nrequired to sell such\ninterests. If that\noccurs, the firm may\nreceive a value for\nits interests that is\nless than the then\ncarrying value as\nthere could be a\nlimited secondary\nmarket for these\ninvestments and the\nfirm may be unable to\nsell them in orderly\ntransactions. As of\nMarch 2023, the amount\nby which the firm\u2019s\ninvestment in such\nfunds would need to be\nreduced in order to\nachieve conformance\nwas approximately $\n100million (net of the\nfirm\u2019s pro rata share\nof cash in the funds).\nThe table below presents the fair value of\ninvestments in funds at NAV and the related\nunfunded commitments.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  mill\u2026              Fair                     \n  As of              Value                    \n  March              of               Unfun\u2026  \n  2023               Inve\u2026            Commi\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Priv\u2026                                       \n  equi\u2026    $    818         $    618          \n  funds                                       \n  Cred\u2026       1,742              293          \n  funds                                       \n  Hedge          65                \u2013          \n  funds                                       \n  Real                                        \n  esta\u2026         395              138          \n  funds                                       \n  Total    $  3,020         $  1,049          \n  As of                                       \n  Dece\u2026                                       \n  2022                                        \n  Priv\u2026                                       \n  equi\u2026    $    815         $    647          \n  funds                                       \n  Cred\u2026       1,645              303          \n  funds                                       \n  Hedge          68                \u2013          \n  funds                                       \n  Real                                        \n  esta\u2026         413              138          \n  funds                                       \n  Total    $  2,941         $  1,088          \n                                              \n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    38  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Corporate\nloans are secured (typically by a senior lien\non the assets of the borrower) or unsecured,\ndepending on the loan purpose, the risk\nprofile of the borrower and other factors. \u2022\nCommercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate\nloans includes originated loans that are\ndirectly or indirectly secured by hotels,\nretail stores, multifamily housing complexes\nand commercial and industrial properties.\nCommercial real estate loans also includes\nloans extended to clients who warehouse assets\nthat are directly or indirectly backed by\ncommercial real estate. In addition,\ncommercial real estate includes loans\npurchased by the firm. \u2022 Residential Real\nEstate. Residential real estate loans\nprimarily includes loans extended to wealth\nmanagement clients and to clients who\nwarehouse assets that are directly or\nindirectly secured by residential real estate.\nIn addition, residential real estate includes\nloans purchased by the firm. \u2022 Securities-\nBased. Securities-based loans includes loans\nthat are secured by stocks, bonds, mutual\nfunds, and exchange-traded funds. These loans\nare primarily extended to the firm's wealth\nmanagement clients and used for purposes other\nthan purchasing, carrying or trading margin\nstocks. Securities-based loans require\nborrowers to post additional collateral based\non changes in the underlying collateral's fair\nvalue. \u2022 Other Collateralized. Other\ncollateralized loans includes loans that are\nbacked by specific collateral (other than\nsecurities and real estate). Such loans are\nextended to clients who warehouse assets that\nare directly or indirectly secured by\ncorporate loans, consumer loans and other\nassets. Other collateralized loans also\nincludes loans to investment funds (managed by\nthird parties) that are collateralized by\ncapital commitments of the funds' investors or\nassets held by the fund, as well as other\nsecured loans extended to the firm's wealth\nmanagement clients. \u2022 Installment. Installment\nloans are unsecured loans originated by the\nfirm. \u2022 Credit Cards. Credit card loans are\nloans made pursuant to revolving lines of\ncredit issued to consumers by the firm. \u2022\nOther. Other loans includes unsecured loans\nextended to wealth management clients and\nunsecured consumer and credit card loans\npurchased by the firm. See Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s fair value measurement\npolicies, valuation techniques and significant\ninputs used to determine the fair value of\nloans, and Note 5 for information about loans\nwithin the fair value hierarchy. Credit\nQuality Risk Assessment. The firm\u2019s risk\nassessment process includes evaluating the\ncredit quality of its loans by the firm\u2019s\nindependent risk oversight and control\nfunction. For corporate loans and a majority\nof securities-based, real estate, other\ncollateralized and other loans, the firm\nperforms credit analyses which incorporate\ninitial and ongoing evaluations of the\ncapacity and willingness of a borrower to meet\nits financial obligations. These credit\nevaluations are performed on an annual basis\nor more frequently if deemed necessary as a\nresult of events or changes in circumstances.\nThe firm determines an internal credit rating\nfor the borrower by considering the results of\nthe credit evaluations and assumptions with\nrespect to the nature of and outlook for the\nborrower\u2019s industry and the economic\nenvironment. Beginning in the first quarter of\n2023, the firm also takes into consideration\ncollateral received or other credit support\narrangements when determining an internal\ncredit rating on collateralized loans, as\nmanagement believes that this methodology\nbetter reflects the credit quality of the\nunderlying loans. In the table below, prior\nperiod amounts have been conformed to reflect\nthe current methodology. The impact to\nDecember 2022 was an increase in loans\nclassified as investment-grade and a decrease\nin loans classified as non-investment-grade of\n$ 25.0billion in real estate (warehouse loans)\nand other collateralized loans. For consumer\nloans and for loans that are not assigned an\ninternal credit rating, the firm reviews\ncertain key metrics, including, but not\nlimited to, the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO)\ncredit scores, delinquency status, collateral\nvalue and other risk factors.\n                                            \n  41    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These\nmodifications, to the\nextent significant,\nwere considered TDRs\nas of December 2022.\nIn January 2023, the\nfirm adopted ASU No.\n2022-02, which\neliminated the\nrecognition and\nmeasurement guidance\nfor TDRs and requires\nenhanced disclosures\nfor certain loan\nmodifications. As of\nDecember 2022, loans\nmodified in a TDR were\n$ 231million and\ncommitments related to\nsuch loans were not\nmaterial.\nSubstantially all of\nsuch loans modified in\na TDR were related to\ncorporate and\ncommercial real estate\nloans. During the\nthree months ended\nMarch 2023, the firm\nprovided loan\nmodifications (in the\nform of term\nextensions) to\nborrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty.\nThe carrying value of\nsuch loans was $\n337million as of March\n2023 and commitments\nrelated to such loans\nwere not material.\nSubstantially all of\nsuch loan\nmodifications were\nrelated to corporate\nand commercial real\nestate loans. The\nimpact of these\nmodifications was not\nmaterial for the three\nmonths ended March\n2023.\n\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses The firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit\nlosses consists of the\nallowance for losses\non loans and lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at amortized cost.\nLoans and lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at fair value or\naccounted for at the\nlower of cost or fair\nvalue are not subject\nto an allowance for\ncredit losses. To\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, the firm\nclassifies its loans\nand lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at amortized cost\ninto wholesale and\nconsumer portfolios.\nThese portfolios\nrepresent the level at\nwhich the firm has\ndeveloped and\ndocumented its\nmethodology to\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. The allowance\nfor credit losses is\nmeasured on a\ncollective basis for\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics using\na modeled approach and\non an asset-specific\nbasis for loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses takes\ninto account the\nweighted average of a\nrange of forecasts of\nfuture economic\nconditions over the\nexpected life of the\nloan and lending\ncommitments. The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios described\nbelow. The firm\napplies judgment in\nweighing individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including the\nfirm\u2019s internally\nderived economic\noutlook, market\nconsensus, recent\nmacroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses also includes\nqualitative components\nwhich allow management\nto reflect the\nuncertain nature of\neconomic forecasting,\ncapture uncertainty\nregarding model\ninputs, and account\nfor model imprecision\nand concentration\nrisk.\n                                            \n  45    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These loans included $\n692million as of March 2023 and $ 384million\nas of December 2022 of loans which did not\nrequire a reserve as the loan was deemed to be\nrecoverable.\nSee Note 18 for\nfurther information\nabout lending\ncommitments.\n\nThe following is a\ndescription of the\nmethodology used to\ncalculate the\nallowance for credit\nlosses: Wholesale. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for wholesale\nloans and lending\ncommitments that\nexhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics is\nmeasured using a\nmodeled approach.\nThese models determine\nthe probability of\ndefault and loss given\ndefault based on\nvarious risk factors,\nincluding internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators, the\nborrower\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial\nobligations, the\nborrower\u2019s country of\nrisk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. For\nlending commitments,\nthe methodology also\nconsiders the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding.\nIn addition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nthe loan-to-value\nratio, debt service\nratio and home price\nindex. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nwholesale loans and\nlending commitments\ninclude unemployment\nrates, GDP, credit\nspreads, commercial\nand industrial\ndelinquency rates,\nshort- and long-term\ninterest rates, and\noil prices. The\nallowance for loan\nlosses for wholesale\nloans that do not\nshare similar risk\ncharacteristics, such\nas nonaccrual loans,\nis calculated using\nthe present value of\nexpected future cash\nflows discounted at\nthe loan\u2019s effective\nrate, the observable\nmarket price of the\nloan or the fair value\nof the collateral.\nWholesale loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\nConsumer. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for consumer\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics is\ncalculated using a\nmodeled approach which\nclassifies consumer\nloans into pools based\non borrower-related\nand exposure-related\ncharacteristics that\ndifferentiate a pool\u2019s\nrisk characteristics\nfrom other pools. The\nfactors considered in\ndetermining a pool are\ngenerally consistent\nwith the risk\ncharacteristics used\nfor internal credit\nrisk measurement and\nmanagement and include\nkey metrics, such as\nFICO credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nconsumer loans include\nunemployment rates and\ndelinquency rates. The\nexpected life of\nrevolving credit card\nloans is determined by\nmodeling expected\nfuture draws and the\ntiming and amount of\nrepayments allocated\nto the funded balance.\nThe firm also\nrecognizes an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on commitments\nto acquire loans and\ncommitments extended\nin connection with\npoint-of-sale\nfinancing. However, no\nallowance for credit\nlosses is recognized\non credit card lending\ncommitments as they\nare cancellable by the\nfirm. Installment\nloans are charged off\nwhen they are 120 days\npast due. Credit card\nloans are charged off\nwhen they are 180 days\npast due.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    46  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value Option Other Financial\nAssets and Liabilities at Fair Value In\naddition to trading assets and liabilities,\nand certain investments and loans, the firm\naccounts for certain of its other financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value,\nsubstantially all under the fair value option.\nThe primary reasons for electing the fair\nvalue option are to: \u2022 Reflect economic events\nin earnings on a timely basis; \u2022 Mitigate\nvolatility in earnings from using different\nmeasurement attributes (e.g., transfers of\nfinancial assets accounted for as financings\nare recorded at fair value, whereas the\nrelated secured financing would be recorded on\nan accrual basis absent electing the fair\nvalue option); and \u2022 Address simplification\nand cost-benefit considerations (e.g.,\naccounting for hybrid financial instruments at\nfair value in their entirety versus\nbifurcation of embedded derivatives and hedge\naccounting for debt hosts). Hybrid financial\ninstruments are instruments that contain\nbifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not\nrequire settlement by physical delivery of\nnonfinancial assets (e.g., physical\ncommodities). If the firm elects to bifurcate\nthe embedded derivative from the associated\ndebt, the derivative is accounted for at fair\nvalue and the host contract is accounted for\nat amortized cost, adjusted for the effective\nportion of any fair value hedges. If the firm\ndoes not elect to bifurcate, the entire hybrid\nfinancial instrument is accounted for at fair\nvalue under the fair value option. Other\nfinancial assets and liabilities accounted for\nat fair value under the fair value option\ninclude: \u2022 Resale and repurchase agreements; \u2022\nCertain securities borrowed and loaned\ntransactions; \u2022 Certain customer and other\nreceivables and certain other assets and\nliabilities; \u2022 Certain time deposits (deposits\nwith no stated maturity are not eligible for a\nfair value option election), including\nstructured certificates of deposit, which are\nhybrid financial instruments; \u2022 Substantially\nall other secured financings, including\ntransfers of assets accounted for as\nfinancings; and \u2022 Certain unsecured short- and\nlong-term borrowings, substantially all of\nwhich are hybrid financial instruments.

The firm generally calculates the fair\nvalue of loans and lending commitments for\nwhich the fair value option is elected by\ndiscounting future cash flows at a rate which\nincorporates the instrument-specific credit\nspreads. For floating-rate loans and lending\ncommitments, substantially all changes in fair\nvalue are attributable to changes in\ninstrument-specific credit spreads, whereas\nfor fixed-rate loans and lending commitments,\nchanges in fair value are also attributable to\nchanges in interest rates.\n\nNote 11. Collateralized Agreements and\nFinancings Collateralized agreements are\nresale agreements and securities borrowed.\nCollateralized financings are repurchase\nagreements, securities loaned and other\nsecured financings. The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things,\nfacilitate client activities, invest excess\ncash, acquire securities to cover short\npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings with\nthe same settlement date are presented on a\nnet-by-counterparty basis when such\ntransactions meet certain settlement criteria\nand are subject to netting agreements.\nInterest on collateralized agreements, which\nis included in interest income, and\ncollateralized financings, which is included\nin interest expense, is recognized over the\nlife of the transaction. See Note 23 for\nfurther information about interest income and\ninterest expense. Resale and Repurchase\nAgreements A resale agreement is a transaction\nin which the firm purchases financial\ninstruments from a seller, typically in\nexchange for cash, and simultaneously enters\ninto an agreement to resell the same or\nsubstantially the same financial instruments\nto the seller at a stated price plus accrued\ninterest at a future date. A repurchase\nagreement is a transaction in which the firm\nsells financial instruments to a buyer,\ntypically in exchange for cash, and\nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same\nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a\nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale\nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d) involve the legal transfer of\nownership of financial instruments, they are\naccounted for as financing arrangements\nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the\nmaturity of the agreement. The financial\ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and\nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.\ngovernment and agency, and investment-grade\nsovereign obligations. The firm receives\nfinancial instruments purchased under resale\nagreements and makes delivery of financial\ninstruments sold under repurchase agreements.\nTo mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these financial\ninstruments on a daily basis, and delivers or\nobtains additional collateral due to changes\nin the market value of the financial\ninstruments, as appropriate. For resale\nagreements, the firm typically requires\ncollateral with a fair value approximately\nequal to the carrying value of the relevant\nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    50  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

When the\nfirm returns the\nsecurities, the\ncounterparty returns\nthe cash or\nsecurities. Interest\nis generally paid\nperiodically over the\nlife of the\ntransaction. In a\nsecurities loaned\ntransaction, the firm\nlends securities to a\ncounterparty in\nexchange for cash or\nsecurities. When the\ncounterparty returns\nthe securities, the\nfirm returns the cash\nor securities posted\nas collateral.\nInterest is generally\npaid periodically over\nthe life of the\ntransaction. The firm\nreceives securities\nborrowed and makes\ndelivery of securities\nloaned. To mitigate\ncredit exposure, the\nfirm monitors the\nmarket value of these\nsecurities on a daily\nbasis, and delivers or\nobtains additional\ncollateral due to\nchanges in the market\nvalue of the\nsecurities, as\nappropriate. For\nsecurities borrowed\ntransactions, the firm\ntypically requires\ncollateral with a fair\nvalue approximately\nequal to the carrying\nvalue of the\nsecurities borrowed\ntransaction.\nSecurities borrowed\nand loaned within FICC\nfinancing are recorded\nat fair value under\nthe fair value option.\nSee Note 5 for further\ninformation about\nsecurities borrowed\nand loaned accounted\nfor at fair value.\nSubstantially all of\nthe securities\nborrowed and loaned\nwithin Equities\nfinancing are recorded\nbased on the amount of\ncash collateral\nadvanced or received\nplus accrued interest.\nThe firm also reviews\nsuch securities\nborrowed to determine\nif an allowance for\ncredit losses should\nbe recorded by taking\ninto consideration the\nfair value of\ncollateral received.\nAs these agreements\ngenerally can be\nterminated on demand,\nthey exhibit little,\nif any, sensitivity to\nchanges in interest\nrates. Therefore, the\ncarrying value of such\nagreements\napproximates fair\nvalue. As these\nagreements are not\naccounted for at fair\nvalue, they are not\nincluded in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy\nin Notes 4 and 5. Had\nthese agreements been\nincluded in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy,\nthey would have been\nclassified in level 2\nas of both March 2023\nand December 2022.\n\nOffsetting\nArrangements\nThe table below presents resale and repurchase\nagreements and securities borrowed and loaned\ntransactions included in the consolidated\nbalance sheets, as well as the amounts not\noffset in the consolidated balance sheets.\n                                              \n            \u2026        \u2026          R\u2026        S\u2026  \n         \u2026  \u2026        \u2026       \u2026  a\u2026        l\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n                                              \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n                                              \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 Substantially all of the gross carrying\nvalues of these arrangements are subject to\nenforceable netting agreements.\n\u2022 Where the firm has received or posted\ncollateral under credit support agreements,\nbut has not yet determined such agreements are\nenforceable, the related collateral has not\nbeen netted.\n\u2022 Amounts not offset includes counterparty\nnetting that does not meet the criteria for\nnetting under U.S. GAAP and the fair value of\ncollateral received or posted subject to\nenforceable credit support agreements.\n\u2022 Resale agreements and repurchase agreements\nare carried at fair value under the fair value\noption.

the use of\nother secured\nfinancings and pledges\nfinancial instruments\nand other assets as\ncollateral in these\ntransactions. These\nother secured\nfinancings include: \u2022\nLiabilities of\nconsolidated VIEs; \u2022\nTransfers of assets\naccounted for as\nfinancings rather than\nsales (e.g., pledged\ncommodities, bank\nloans and mortgage\nwhole loans); and \u2022\nOther structured\nfinancing\narrangements. Other\nsecured financings\nincluded nonrecourse\narrangements.\nNonrecourse other\nsecured financings\nwere $ 7.99billion as\nof March 2023 and $\n7.94billion as of\nDecember 2022. The\nfirm has elected to\napply the fair value\noption to\nsubstantially all\nother secured\nfinancings because the\nuse of fair value\neliminates non-\neconomic volatility in\nearnings that would\narise from using\ndifferent measurement\nattributes. See Note\n10 for further\ninformation about\nother secured\nfinancings that are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue.

The remainder is\nheld by investment entities, including VIEs,\nconsolidated by the firm. Substantially all\nproperty and equipment is depreciated on a\nstraight-line basis over the useful life of\nthe asset. Leasehold improvements are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the\nshorter of the useful life of the improvement\nor the term of the lease. Capitalized costs of\nsoftware developed or obtained for internal\nuse are amortized on a straight-line basis\nover three years. The firm tests property,\nleasehold improvements and equipment for\nimpairment when events or changes in\ncircumstances suggest that an asset\u2019s or asset\ngroup\u2019s carrying value may not be fully\nrecoverable. To the extent the carrying value\nof an asset or asset group exceeds the\nprojected undiscounted cash flows expected to\nresult from the use and eventual disposal of\nthe asset or asset group, the firm determines\nthe asset or asset group is impaired and\nrecords an impairment equal to the difference\nbetween the estimated fair value and the\ncarrying value of the asset or asset group. In\naddition, the firm will recognize an\nimpairment prior to the sale of an asset or\nasset group if the carrying value of the asset\nor asset group exceeds its estimated fair\nvalue.

Goodwill is\nassessed for\nimpairment annually in\nthe fourth quarter or\nmore frequently if\nevents occur or\ncircumstances change\nthat indicate an\nimpairment may exist.\nWhen assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its carrying\nvalue. If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment. The\nquantitative goodwill\ntest compares the\nestimated fair value\nof each reporting unit\nwith its carrying\nvalue (including\ngoodwill and\nidentifiable\nintangible assets). If\nthe reporting unit\u2019s\nestimated fair value\nexceeds its carrying\nvalue, goodwill is not\nimpaired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated fair value\nof a reporting unit is\nless than its carrying\nvalue. In the fourth\nquarter of 2022,\ngoodwill was tested\nfor impairment using a\nquantitative test. The\nestimated fair value\nof each of the\nreporting units\nexceeded its\nrespective carrying\nvalue, and therefore,\ngoodwill was not\nimpaired.\n\nThe estimated fair\nvalue of each\nreporting unit was\nbased on valuation\ntechniques the firm\nbelieves market\nparticipants would use\nto value these\nreporting units.\nEstimated fair values\nare generally derived\nfrom utilizing a\nrelative value\ntechnique, which\napplies observable\nprice-to-earnings\nmultiples or price-to-\nbook multiples of\ncomparable competitors\nto the reporting\nunits\u2019 net earnings or\nnet book value, or a\ndiscounted cash flow\nvaluation approach,\nfor reporting units\nwith businesses in\nearly stages of\ndevelopment. The\ncarrying value of each\nreporting unit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nBased on the\nevaluation of relevant\nfactors during the\nfirst quarter of 2023,\nincluding stress in\nthe banking sector,\nthe firm determined it\nwas more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of each of\nthe reporting units\nexceeded its\nrespective carrying\nvalue as of March\n2023.

In\naddition, the firm\nwill recognize an\nimpairment prior to\nthe sale of an asset\nor asset group if the\ncarrying value of the\nasset or asset group\nexceeds its estimated\nfair value.There were\nno material\nimpairments during\neither the three\nmonths ended March\n2023 or March 2022.\nOperating Lease Right-\nof-Use Assets\nThe firm enters into\noperating leases for\nreal estate, office\nequipment and other\nassets, substantially\nall of which are used\nin connection with its\noperations. For leases\nlonger than one year,\nthe firm recognizes a\nright-of-use asset\nrepresenting the right\nto use the underlying\nasset for the lease\nterm, and a lease\nliability representing\nthe liability to make\npayments. The lease\nterm is generally\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual\nmaturity of the lease.\nFor leases where the\nfirm has the option to\nterminate or extend\nthe lease, an\nassessment of the\nlikelihood of\nexercising the option\nis incorporated into\nthe determination of\nthe lease term. Such\nassessment is\ninitially performed at\nthe inception of the\nlease and is updated\nif events occur that\nimpact the original\nassessment.\nAn operating lease\nright-of-use asset is\ninitially determined\nbased on the operating\nlease liability,\nadjusted for initial\ndirect costs, lease\nincentives and amounts\npaid at or prior to\nlease commencement.\nThis amount is then\namortized over the\nlease term.Right-of-\nuse assets and\noperating lease\nliabilities recognized\n(in non-cash\ntransactions for\nleases entered into or\nassumed) by the firm\nwere $ 38million for\nthe three months ended\nMarch 2023 and $\n67million for the\nthree months ended\nMarch 2022. See Note\n15 for information\nabout operating lease\nliabilities.\nFor leases where the\nfirm will derive no\neconomic benefit from\nleased space that it\nhas vacated or where\nthe firm has shortened\nthe term of a lease\nwhen space is no\nlonger needed, the\nfirm will record an\nimpairment or\naccelerated\namortization of right-\nof-use assets.There\nwere no material\nimpairments or\naccelerated\namortizations during\neither the three\nmonths ended March\n2023 or March 2022.\nMiscellaneous\nReceivables and Other\nMiscellaneous\nreceivables and other\nincluded: \u2022 A term\ndeposit with First\nRepublic Bank of\napproximately $\n2.4billion as of March\n2023. This deposit is\naccounted for at cost,\nnet of an allowance\nfor credit losses. \u2022\nInvestments in\nqualified affordable\nhousing projects of $\n1.30billion as of\nMarch 2023 and $\n793million as of\nDecember 2022. The\nfirm accounts for\nthese investments\nusing the proportional\namortization method\nsuch that the\ninvestment is\namortized in\nproportion to the\nincome tax credits\nreceived on such\ninvestments.

Goldman Sachs Capital I\nissued $ 2.75billion of guaranteed preferred\nbeneficial interests (Trust Preferred\nsecurities) to third parties and $ 85million\nof common beneficial interests to Group Inc.\nAs of both March 2023 and December 2022, the\noutstanding par amount of junior subordinated\ndebt held by Goldman Sachs Capital I was $\n968million and the outstanding par amount of\nTrust Preferred securities and common\nbeneficial interests issued by Goldman Sachs\nCapital I was $ 939million and $ 29million,\nrespectively. Goldman Sachs Capital I is a\nwholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm\nfor regulatory and legal purposes but is not\nconsolidated for accounting purposes. The firm\npays interest semi-annually on the junior\nsubordinated debt at an annual rate of 6.345%\nand the debt matures on February 15, 2034. The\ncoupon rate and the payment dates applicable\nto the beneficial interests are the same as\nthe interest rate and payment dates for the\njunior subordinated debt. The firm has the\nright, from time to time, to defer payment of\ninterest on the junior subordinated debt, and\ntherefore cause payment on Goldman Sachs\nCapital I\u2019s preferred beneficial interests to\nbe deferred, in each case up to ten\nconsecutive semi-annual periods. During any\nsuch deferral period, the firm will not be\npermitted to, among other things, pay\ndividends on or make certain repurchases of\nits common stock. Goldman Sachs Capital I is\nnot permitted to pay any distributions on the\ncommon beneficial interests held by Group Inc.\nunless all dividends payable on the preferred\nbeneficial interests have been paid in full.\n                                            \n  59    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Note 16. Securitization\nActivities The firm securitizes residential\nand commercial mortgages, corporate bonds,\nloans and other types of financial assets by\nselling these assets to securitization\nvehicles (e.g., trusts, corporate entities and\nlimited liability companies) or through a\nresecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter\nof the beneficial interests that are sold to\ninvestors. The firm\u2019s residential mortgage\nsecuritizations are primarily in connection\nwith government agency securitizations. The\nfirm accounts for a securitization as a sale\nwhen it has relinquished control over the\ntransferred financial assets. Prior to\nsecuritization, the firm generally accounts\nfor assets pending transfer at fair value and\ntherefore does not typically recognize\nsignificant gains or losses upon the transfer\nof assets. Net revenues from underwriting\nactivities are recognized in connection with\nthe sales of the underlying beneficial\ninterests to investors.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    60  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Expected credit\nloss assumptions are\nreflected in the\ndiscount rate for the\nremainder of retained\ninterests.\nThe firm has other retained interests not\nreflected in the table above with a fair value\nof $ 368million and a weighted average life of\n6.9years as of March 2023, and a fair value of\n$ 384million and a weighted average life of\n6.4years as of December 2022. Due to the\nnature and fair value of certain of these\nretained interests, the weighted average\nassumptions for constant prepayment and\ndiscount rates and the related sensitivity to\nadverse changes are not meaningful as of both\nMarch 2023 and December 2022. The firm\u2019s\nmaximum exposure to adverse changes in the\nvalue of these interests is the carrying value\nof $ 381million as of March 2023 and $\n398million as of December 2022.\n\nNote 17. Variable Interest Entities A variable\ninterest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt\nor equity) or other interest (e.g.,\nderivatives or loans and lending commitments)\nthat will absorb portions of the VIE\u2019s\nexpected losses and/or receive portions of the\nVIE\u2019s expected residual returns. The firm\u2019s\nvariable interests in VIEs include senior and\nsubordinated debt; loans and lending\ncommitments; limited and general partnership\ninterests; preferred and common equity;\nderivatives that may include foreign currency,\nequity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and\ncertain of the fees the firm receives from\ninvestment funds. Certain interest rate,\nforeign currency and credit derivatives the\nfirm enters into with VIEs are not variable\ninterests because they create, rather than\nabsorb, risk. VIEs generally finance the\npurchase of assets by issuing debt and equity\nsecurities that are either collateralized by\nor indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The\ndebt and equity securities issued by a VIE may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. The firm\u2019s involvement with\nVIEs includes securitization of financial\nassets, as described in Note 16, and\ninvestments in and loans to other types of\nVIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the\nfirm\u2019s consolidation policies, including the\ndefinition of a VIE. VIE Consolidation\nAnalysis The enterprise with a controlling\nfinancial interest in a VIE is known as the\nprimary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE.\nThe firm determines whether it is the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis\nthat principally considers: \u2022 Which variable\ninterest holder has the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly\nimpact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; \u2022 Which\nvariable interest holder has the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s purpose\nand design, including the risks the VIE was\ndesigned to create and pass through to its\nvariable interest holders; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s capital\nstructure; \u2022 The terms between the VIE and its\nvariable interest holders and other parties\ninvolved with the VIE; and \u2022 Related-party\nrelationships.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    62  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\nreassesses its\ndetermination of\nwhether it is the\nprimary beneficiary of\na VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current\nfacts and\ncircumstances. VIE\nActivities The firm is\nprincipally involved\nwith VIEs through the\nfollowing business\nactivities: Mortgage-\nBacked VIEs. The firm\nsells residential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans and securities\nto mortgage-backed\nVIEs and may retain\nbeneficial interests\nin the assets sold to\nthese VIEs. The firm\npurchases and sells\nbeneficial interests\nissued by mortgage-\nbacked VIEs in\nconnection with\nmarket-making\nactivities. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into derivatives\nwith certain of these\nVIEs, primarily\ninterest rate swaps,\nwhich are typically\nnot variable\ninterests. The firm\ngenerally enters into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk.\nReal Estate, Credit-\nand Power-Related and\nOther Investing VIEs.\nThe firm purchases\nequity and debt\nsecurities issued by\nand makes loans to\nVIEs that hold real\nestate, performing and\nnonperforming debt,\ndistressed loans,\npower-related assets\nand equity securities.\nThe firm generally\ndoes not sell assets\nto, or enter into\nderivatives with,\nthese VIEs. Corporate\nDebt and Other Asset-\nBacked VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue notes to\nclients, purchases and\nsells beneficial\ninterests issued by\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs in connection\nwith market-making\nactivities, and makes\nloans to VIEs that\nwarehouse corporate\ndebt. Certain of these\nVIEs synthetically\ncreate the exposure\nfor the beneficial\ninterests they issue\nby entering into\ncredit derivatives\nwith the firm, rather\nthan purchasing the\nunderlying assets. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into\nderivatives, such as\ntotal return swaps,\nwith certain corporate\ndebt and other asset-\nbacked VIEs, under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE a return due\nto the beneficial\ninterest holders and\nreceives the return on\nthe collateral owned\nby the VIE. The\ncollateral owned by\nthese VIEs is\nprimarily other asset-\nbacked loans and\nsecurities. The firm\nmay be removed as the\ntotal return swap\ncounterparty and may\nenter into derivatives\nwith other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk\nrelated to these\nswaps. The firm may\nsell assets to the\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs it structures.\n\nPrincipal-Protected\nNote VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs\nown portfolios of\nassets, principally\nwith exposure to hedge\nfunds. Substantially\nall of the principal\nprotection on the\nnotes issued by these\nVIEs is provided by\nthe asset portfolio\nrebalancing that is\nrequired under the\nterms of the notes.\nThe firm enters into\ntotal return swaps\nwith these VIEs under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE the return due\nto the principal-\nprotected note holders\nand receives the\nreturn on the assets\nowned by the VIE. The\nfirm may enter into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk. The\nfirm also obtains\nfunding through these\nVIEs. Investments in\nFunds. The firm makes\nequity investments in\ncertain investment\nfund VIEs it manages\nand is entitled to\nreceive fees from\nthese VIEs. The firm\nhas generally not sold\nassets to, or entered\ninto derivatives with,\nthese VIEs.\nNonconsolidated VIEs\nThe table below presents a summary of the\nnonconsolidated VIEs in which the firm holds\nvariable interests.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  mil\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  non\u2026               March            Decem\u2026  \n  VIEs        As of  2023             2022    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Ass\u2026                                        \n  in      $  191,7\u2026         $  181,\u2026          \n  VIEs                                        \n  Car\u2026                                        \n  val\u2026                                        \n  of                                          \n  var\u2026    $  13,441         $  12,3\u2026          \n  int\u2026                                        \n  \u2014                                           \n  ass\u2026                                        \n  Car\u2026                                        \n  val\u2026                                        \n  of                                          \n  var\u2026    $   1,051         $    659          \n  int\u2026                                        \n  \u2014                                           \n  lia\u2026                                        \n  Max\u2026                                        \n  exp\u2026                                        \n  to                                          \n  los\u2026                                        \n  Ret\u2026    $   4,887         $  5,043          \n  int\u2026                                        \n  Pur\u2026          993              861          \n  int\u2026                                        \n  Com\u2026                                        \n  and         3,106            3,087          \n  gua\u2026                                        \n  Der\u2026        8,764            8,802          \n  Debt                                        \n  and         7,171            6,026          \n  equ\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026    $  24,921         $  23,8\u2026          \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 The nature of the firm\u2019s variable interests\nis described in the rows under maximum\nexposure to loss.\n\u2022 The firm\u2019s exposure to the obligations of\nVIEs is generally limited to its interests in\nthese entities.

The\nfirm also extends\nlending commitments in\nconnection with other\ntypes of corporate\nlending, commercial\nreal estate financing\nand other\ncollateralized\nlending.See Note 9 for\nfurther information\nabout funded loans.\n\nTo mitigate the credit\nrisk associated with\nthe firm\u2019s commercial\nlending activities,\nthe firm obtains\ncredit protection on\ncertain loans and\nlending commitments\nthrough credit default\nswaps, both single-\nname and index-based\ncontracts, and through\nthe issuance of\ncredit-linked notes.\nWarehouse Financing.\nThe firm provides\nfinancing to clients\nwho warehouse\nfinancial assets.\nThese arrangements are\ncollateralized by the\nwarehoused assets,\nprimarily consisting\nof residential real\nestate, consumer and\ncorporate loans.\nConsumer.

See the tables in\n\u201cCommitments\u201d above for a summary of the\nfirm\u2019s commitments.\n\u2022 The carrying value\nfor derivatives\nincluded derivative\nassets of $ 501million\nas of March 2023 and $\n578million as of\nDecember 2022, and\nderivative liabilities\nof $ 6.87billion as of\nMarch 2023 and $\n8.06billion as of\nDecember 2022.\n\nDerivative Guarantees.\nThe firm enters into\nvarious derivatives\nthat meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee under U.S.\nGAAP, including\nwritten equity and\ncommodity put options,\nwritten currency\ncontracts and interest\nrate caps, floors and\nswaptions. These\nderivatives are risk\nmanaged together with\nderivatives that do\nnot meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, and\ntherefore the amounts\nin the table above do\nnot reflect the firm\u2019s\noverall risk related\nto derivative\nactivities.\nDisclosures about\nderivatives are not\nrequired if they may\nbe cash settled and\nthe firm has no basis\nto conclude it is\nprobable that the\ncounterparties held\nthe underlying\ninstruments at the\ninception of the\ncontract. The firm has\nconcluded that these\nconditions have been\nmet for certain large,\ninternationally active\ncommercial and\ninvestment bank\ncounterparties,\ncentral clearing\ncounterparties, hedge\nfunds and certain\nother counterparties.\nAccordingly, the firm\nhas not included such\ncontracts in the table\nabove. See Note 7 for\ninformation about\ncredit derivatives\nthat meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, which are\nnot included in the\ntable above.\nDerivatives are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue and therefore\nthe carrying value is\nconsidered the best\nindication of\npayment/performance\nrisk for individual\ncontracts. However,\nthe carrying values in\nthe table above\nexclude the effect of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting.\nSecurities Lending and\nClearing Guarantees .\nSecurities lending and\nclearing guarantees\ninclude the\nindemnifications and\nguarantees that the\nfirm provides in its\ncapacity as an agency\nlender and in its\ncapacity as a\nsponsoring member of\nthe Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation.\nAs an agency lender,\nthe firm indemnifies\nmost of its securities\nlending customers\nagainst losses\nincurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not\nreturn securities and\nthe collateral held is\ninsufficient to cover\nthe market value of\nthe securities\nborrowed.The maximum\npayout of such\nindemnifications was $\n16.56billion as of\nMarch 2023 and $\n12.23billion as of\nDecember 2022.\nCollateral held by the\nlenders in connection\nwith securities\nlending\nindemnifications was $\n17.11billion as of\nMarch 2023 and $\n12.62billion as of\nDecember 2022. Because\nthe contractual nature\nof these arrangements\nrequires the firm to\nobtain collateral with\na market value that\nexceeds the value of\nthe securities lent to\nthe borrower, there is\nminimal performance\nrisk associated with\nthese\nindemnifications.\n                                            \n  67    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nAs a sponsoring member of the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the\nperformance of its sponsored member clients to\nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in\nconnection with certain resale and repurchase\nagreements. To minimize potential losses on\nsuch guarantees, the firm obtains a security\ninterest in the collateral that the sponsored\nclient placed with the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on\nsuch guarantees is minimal. The maximum payout\non this guarantee was $ 8.71billion as of\nMarch 2023 and $ 8.74billion as of December\n2022. The related collateral held was $\n8.73billion as of March 2023 and $ 8.70billion\nas of December 2022. Other Financial\nGuarantees . In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm provides other financial\nguarantees of the obligations of third parties\n(e.g., standby letters of credit and other\nguarantees to enable clients to complete\ntransactions and fund-related guarantees).\nThese guarantees represent obligations to make\npayments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed\nparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a\ncontractual arrangement with that\nbeneficiary.Other financial guarantees also\ninclude a guarantee that the firm has provided\nto the Government of Malaysia that it will\nreceive, by August 2025, at least $ 1.4billion\nin assets and proceeds from assets seized by\ngovernmental authorities around the world\nrelated to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a\nsovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In\nconnection with this guarantee, the firm is\nalso required to make a one-time interim\npayment of $ 250million towards the $\n1.4billion if the Government of Malaysia has\nnot received at least $ 500million in assets\nand proceeds by August 2022. The firm\nconsiders semi-annual reports and other\ncommunications from Malaysia in evaluating the\nprogress of Malaysia\u2019s recovery efforts. The\nfirm and the Government of Malaysia disagree\nabout and, following an extension of the\ncontractual dispute resolution period,\ncontinue to discuss whether the Government of\nMalaysia did, in fact, recover at least $\n500million as of August 2022 and whether any\ninterim payment was due. If the parties are\nunable to resolve this dispute, it would be\nsettled by arbitration. Any amounts paid by\nthe firm would, in any event, be subject to\nreimbursement in the event the assets and\nproceeds received by the Government of\nMalaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed $\n1.4billion. See Note 27 for further\ninformation about matters related to 1MDB.\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The\nfirm has established trusts, including Goldman\nSachs Capital I, Goldman Sachs Capital II and\nGoldman Sachs Capital III (the Trusts), and\nother entities, for the limited purpose of\nissuing securities to third parties, lending\nthe proceeds to the firm and entering into\ncontractual arrangements with the firm and\nthird parties related to this purpose. The\nfirm does not consolidate these entities. See\nNotes 14 and 19 for further information about\nthe transactions involving the Trusts. The\nfirm effectively provides for the full and\nunconditional guarantee of the securities\nissued by these entities. Timely payment by\nthe firm of amounts due to these entities\nunder the guarantee, borrowing, preferred\nstock and related contractual arrangements\nwill be sufficient to cover payments due on\nthe securities issued by these entities. No\nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the\nsecurities of the Trusts. Management believes\nthat it is unlikely that any circumstances\nwill occur, such as nonperformance on the part\nof paying agents or other service providers,\nthat would make it necessary for the firm to\nmake payments related to these entities other\nthan those required under the terms of the\nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and\nrelated contractual arrangements and in\nconnection with certain expenses incurred by\nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of\nService Providers. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees\ncertain service providers, such as clearing\nand custody agents, trustees and\nadministrators, against specified potential\nlosses in connection with their acting as an\nagent of, or providing services to, the firm\nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses\narising from its custodial role or caused by\nacts or omissions of third-party service\nproviders, including sub-custodians and third-\nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has\nthe right to seek indemnification from these\nthird-party service providers for certain\nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In\naddition, the firm is a member of payment,\nclearing and settlement networks, as well as\nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of\nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of\nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In\nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear\nand settle transactions entered into by\nclients with other brokerage firms. The firm\u2019s\nobligations in respect of such transactions\nare secured by the assets in the client\u2019s\naccount and proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the firm\non behalf of the client. In connection with\njoint venture investments, the firm may issue\nloan guarantees under which it may be liable\nin the event of fraud, misappropriation,\nenvironmental liabilities and other matters\ninvolving the borrower.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    68  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Other\nRepresentations,\nWarranties and\nIndemnifications. The\nfirm provides\nrepresentations and\nwarranties to\ncounterparties in\nconnection with a\nvariety of commercial\ntransactions and\noccasionally\nindemnifies them\nagainst potential\nlosses caused by the\nbreach of those\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. The firm\nmay also provide\nindemnifications\nprotecting against\nchanges in or adverse\napplication of certain\nU.S. tax laws in\nconnection with\nordinary-course\ntransactions, such as\nsecurities issuances,\nborrowings or\nderivatives. In\naddition, the firm may\nprovide\nindemnifications to\nsome counterparties to\nprotect them in the\nevent additional taxes\nare owed or payments\nare withheld, due\neither to a change in\nor an adverse\napplication of certain\nnon-U.S. tax laws.\nThese indemnifications\ngenerally are standard\ncontractual terms and\nare entered into in\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness. Generally,\nthere are no stated or\nnotional amounts\nincluded in these\nindemnifications, and\nthe contingencies\ntriggering the\nobligation to\nindemnify are not\nexpected to occur. The\nfirm is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder these guarantees\nand indemnifications.\nHowever, management\nbelieves that it is\nunlikely the firm will\nhave to make any\nmaterial payments\nunder these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\narrangements have been\nrecognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both\nMarch 2023 and\nDecember 2022.\nGuarantees of\nSubsidiaries. Group\nInc. is the entity\nthat fully and\nunconditionally\nguarantees the\nsecurities issued by\nGS Finance Corp., a\nwholly-owned finance\nsubsidiary of the\nfirm. Group Inc. has\nguaranteed the payment\nobligations of Goldman\nSachs & Co. LLC\n(GS&Co.), GS Bank USA\nand Goldman Sachs\nParis Inc. et Cie,\nsubject to certain\nexceptions. In\naddition, Group Inc.\nhas provided\nguarantees to Goldman\nSachs International\n(GSI) and GSBE related\nto agreements that\neach entity has\nentered into with\ncertain of its\ncounterparties. Group\nInc. guarantees many\nof the obligations of\nits other consolidated\nsubsidiaries on a\ntransaction-by-\ntransaction basis, as\nnegotiated with\ncounterparties.

Regulation and Capital Adequacy The\nFRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a\nbank holding company under the U.S. Bank\nHolding Company Act of 1956 and a financial\nholding company under amendments to this Act.\nThe firm is subject to consolidated regulatory\ncapital requirements which are calculated in\naccordance with the regulations of the FRB\n(Capital Framework). The capital requirements\nare expressed as risk-based capital and\nleverage ratios that compare measures of\nregulatory capital to risk-weighted assets\n(RWAs), average assets and off-balance sheet\nexposures. Failure to comply with these\ncapital requirements would result in\nrestrictions being imposed by the firm\u2019s\nregulators and could limit the firm\u2019s ability\nto repurchase shares, pay dividends and make\ncertain discretionary compensation payments.\nThe firm\u2019s capital levels are also subject to\nqualitative judgments by the regulators about\ncomponents of capital, risk weightings and\nother factors. Furthermore, certain of the\nfirm\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to separate\nregulations and capital requirements. Capital\nFramework The regulations under the Capital\nFramework are largely based on the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision\u2019s (Basel\nCommittee) capital framework for strengthening\ninternational capital standards (Basel III)\nand also implement certain provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework,\nthe firm is an \u201cAdvanced approaches\u201d banking\norganization and has been designated as a\nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB).\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum\nrisk-based capital and the capital\nconservation buffer requirements. The buffer\nmust consist entirely of capital that\nqualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)\ncapital. The firm calculates its CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in\naccordance with both the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules. Each of the ratios\ncalculated under the Standardized and Advanced\nCapital Rules must meet its respective capital\nrequirements. Under the Capital Framework, the\nfirm is also subject to leverage requirements\nwhich consist of a minimum Tier 1 leverage\nratio and a minimum supplementary leverage\nratio (SLR), as well as the SLR buffer.\n                                            \n  71    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These\nrequirements also include the capital\nconservation buffer requirements, consisting\nof the G-SIB surcharge (Method 2) of 3.0% as\nof March 2023 and 2.5% as of December 2022 and\nthe countercyclical capital buffer, which the\nFRB has set to zero percent. In addition, the\ncapital conservation buffer requirements\ninclude the stress capital buffer of 6.3%\nunder the Standardized Capital Rules and a\nbuffer of 2.5% under the Advanced Capital\nRules.\n\u2022 The G-SIB surcharge\nis updated annually\nbased on financial\ndata from the prior\nyear and is generally\napplicable for the\nfollowing year. The\nG-SIB surcharge is\ncalculated using two\nmethodologies, the\nhigher of which is\nreflected in the\nfirm\u2019s risk-based\ncapital requirements.\nThe first calculation\n(Method 1) is based on\nthe Basel Committee\u2019s\nmethodology which,\namong other factors,\nrelies upon measures\nof the size, activity\nand complexity of each\nG-SIB. The second\ncalculation (Method 2)\nuses similar inputs\nbut includes a measure\nof reliance on short-\nterm wholesale\nfunding.\nThe table below presents information about\nrisk-based capital ratios.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  mil\u2026                                        \n  As                                          \n  of                                          \n  Mar\u2026                                        \n  2023              Stand\u2026            Advan\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CET1    $  98,0\u2026          $  98,0\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1       $  108,\u2026          $  108,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  2       $  15,5\u2026          $  11,6\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026    $  124,\u2026          $  120,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  RWAs    $  660,\u2026          $  677,\u2026          \n  CET1                                        \n  cap\u2026        14.8  %           14.5  %       \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1           16.4  %           16.0  %       \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  cap\u2026        18.8  %           17.7  %       \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  As                                          \n  of                                          \n  Dec\u2026                                        \n  2022                                        \n  CET1    $  98,0\u2026          $  98,0\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1       $  108,\u2026          $  108,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  2       $  15,9\u2026          $  12,1\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026    $  124,\u2026          $  120,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  RWAs    $  653,\u2026          $  679,\u2026          \n  CET1                                        \n  cap\u2026        15.0  %           14.4  %       \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1           16.6  %           16.0  %       \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  cap\u2026        19.1  %           17.8  %       \n  rat\u2026                                        \n                                              \nLeverage Ratios.

RWAs are calculated in accordance with\nboth the Standardized and Advanced Capital\nRules. Credit Risk Credit RWAs are calculated\nbased on measures of exposure, which are then\nrisk weighted under the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules: \u2022 The Standardized\nCapital Rules apply prescribed risk-weights,\nwhich depend largely on the type of\ncounterparty. The exposure measures for\nderivatives and securities financing\ntransactions are based on specific formulas\nwhich take certain factors into consideration.\n\u2022 Under the Advanced Capital Rules, the firm\ncomputes risk-weights for wholesale and retail\ncredit exposures in accordance with the\nAdvanced Internal Ratings-Based approach. The\nexposure measures for derivatives and\nsecurities financing transactions are computed\nutilizing internal models. \u2022 For both\nStandardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the\nrisk-weights for securitizations and equities\nare based on specific required formulaic\napproaches. Market Risk RWAs for market risk\nin accordance with the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules are generally\nconsistent. Market RWAs are calculated based\non measures of exposure which include the\nfollowing: \u2022 Value-at-Risk (VaR) is the\npotential loss in value of trading assets and\nliabilities, as well as certain investments,\nloans, and other financial assets and\nliabilities accounted for at fair value, due\nto adverse market movements over a defined\ntime horizon with a specified confidence\nlevel. For both risk management purposes and\nregulatory capital calculations, the firm uses\na single VaR model which captures risks,\nincluding those related to interest rates,\nequity prices, currency rates and commodity\nprices. However, VaR used for risk management\npurposes differs from VaR used for regulatory\ncapital requirements (regulatory VaR) due to\ndifferences in time horizons, confidence\nlevels and the scope of positions on which VaR\nis calculated. For risk management purposes, a\n95% one-dayVaR is used, whereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements, a 99% 10-dayVaR is used\nto determine Market RWAs and a 99% one-dayVaR\nis used to determine regulatory VaR\nexceptions. In addition, the daily net\nrevenues used to determine risk management VaR\nexceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net\nrevenues to the VaR measure calculated as of\nthe end of the prior business day) include\nintraday activity, whereas the Capital\nFramework requires that intraday activity be\nexcluded from daily net revenues when\ncalculating regulatory VaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity includes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are more likely than not to be\npositive by their nature. As a result, there\nmay be differences in the number of VaR\nexceptions and the amount of daily net\nrevenues calculated for regulatory VaR\ncompared to the amounts calculated for risk\nmanagement VaR. The firm\u2019s positional losses\nobserved on a single day exceeded its 99% one-\ndayregulatory VaR on one occasion during both\nthe three months ended March 2023 and the year\nended 2022. There was no change in the firm\u2019s\nVaR multiplier used to calculate Market RWAs;\n\u2022 Stressed VaR is the potential loss in value\nof trading assets and liabilities, as well as\ncertain investments, loans, and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities accounted for\nat fair value, during a period of significant\nmarket stress; \u2022 Incremental risk is the\npotential loss in value of non-securitized\npositions due to the default or credit\nmigration of issuers of financial instruments\nover a one-year time horizon; \u2022 Comprehensive\nrisk is the potential loss in value, due to\nprice risk and defaults, within the firm\u2019s\ncredit correlation positions; and \u2022 Specific\nrisk is the risk of loss on a position that\ncould result from factors other than broad\nmarket movements, including event risk,\ndefault risk and idiosyncratic risk. The\nstandardized measurement method is used to\ndetermine specific risk RWAs, by applying\nsupervisory defined risk-weighting factors\nafter applicable netting is performed.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    74  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

GS Bank USA\nis the firm\u2019s primary\nU.S. bank subsidiary.\nGS Bank USA is a New\nYork State-chartered\nbank and a member of\nthe Federal Reserve\nSystem, is supervised\nand regulated by the\nFRB, the FDIC, the New\nYork State Department\nof Financial Services\n(NYDFS) and the\nConsumer Financial\nProtection Bureau, and\nis subject to\nregulatory capital\nrequirements that are\ncalculated under the\nCapital Framework. GS\nBank USA is an\nAdvanced approaches\nbanking organization\nunder the Capital\nFramework. The\ndeposits of GS Bank\nUSA are insured by the\nFDIC to the extent\nprovided by law. The\nCapital Framework\nincludes the minimum\nrisk-based capital and\nthe capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements\n(consisting of a 2.5%\nbuffer and the\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer). The\nbuffer must consist\nentirely of capital\nthat qualifies as CET1\ncapital. In addition,\nthe Capital Framework\nincludes the leverage\nratio requirement. GS\nBank USA is required\nto calculate the CET1\ncapital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total\ncapital ratios in\naccordance with both\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules. The lower of\neach risk-based\ncapital ratio under\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules\nis the ratio against\nwhich GS Bank USA\u2019s\ncompliance with its\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements is\nassessed. In addition,\nunder the regulatory\nframework for prompt\ncorrective action\napplicable to GS Bank\nUSA, in order to meet\nthe quantitative\nrequirements for a\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\ndepository\ninstitution, GS Bank\nUSA must also meet the\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nrequirements in the\ntable below.

Income Taxes Provision for Income\nTaxes Income taxes are provided for using the\nasset and liability method under which\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. The firm reports\ninterest expense related to income tax matters\nin provision for taxes and income tax\npenalties in other expenses. Deferred Income\nTaxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net\ntax effects of temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. These temporary\ndifferences result in taxable or deductible\namounts in future years and are measured using\nthe tax rates and laws that will be in effect\nwhen such differences are expected to reverse.\nValuation allowances are established to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount that more\nlikely than not will be realized and primarily\nrelate to the ability to utilize losses in\nvarious tax jurisdictions. Tax assets are\nincluded in other assets and tax liabilities\nare included in other liabilities.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits The firm recognizes\ntax positions in the consolidated financial\nstatements only when it is more likely than\nnot that the position will be sustained on\nexamination by the relevant taxing authority\nbased on the technical merits of the position.\nA position that meets this standard is\nmeasured at the largest amount of benefit that\nwill more likely than not be realized on\nsettlement. A liability is established for\ndifferences between positions taken in a tax\nreturn and amounts recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Regulatory\nTax Examinations The firm is subject to\nexamination by the U.S. Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) and other taxing authorities in\njurisdictions where the firm has significant\nbusiness operations, such as the United\nKingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states,\nsuch as New York. The tax years under\nexamination vary by jurisdiction. The firm\ndoes not expect completion of these audits to\nhave a material impact on the firm\u2019s financial\ncondition, but it may be material to operating\nresults for a particular period, depending, in\npart, on the operating results for that\nperiod.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    80  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

All issues\nfor the 2019 and 2020\ntax years have been\nresolved and will be\neffectively settled\npending administrative\ncompletion by the IRS.\nFinal completion of\ntax years 2011 through\n2020 will not have a\nmaterial impact on the\neffective tax rate.\nThe 2021 tax year\nremains subject to\npost-filing review.\nNew York State and\nCity examinations of\n2015 through 2018\ncommenced during 2021.\n\nAll years, including\nand subsequent to the\nyears in the table\nabove, remain open to\nexamination by the\ntaxing authorities.\nThe firm believes that\nthe liability for\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits it has\nestablished is\nadequate in relation\nto the potential for\nadditional\nassessments.\nNote 25. Business Segments The firm manages\nand reports its activities in threebusiness\nsegments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset &\nWealth Management and Platform Solutions. See\nNote 1 for information about the firm\u2019s\nbusiness segments. Compensation and benefits\nexpenses in the firm\u2019s segments reflect, among\nother factors, the overall performance of the\nfirm, as well as the performance of individual\nbusinesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in\none segment of the firm\u2019s business may be\nsignificantly affected by the performance of\nthe firm\u2019s other business segments. The firm\nallocates assets (including allocations of\nglobal core liquid assets and cash, secured\nclient financing and other assets), revenues\nand expenses among the threebusiness segments.\nDue to the integrated nature of these\nsegments, estimates and judgments are made in\nallocating certain assets, revenues and\nexpenses. The allocation process is based on\nthe manner in which management currently views\nthe performance of the segments. The\nallocation of common shareholders\u2019 equity and\npreferred stock dividends to each segment is\nbased on the estimated amount of equity\nrequired to support the activities of the\nsegment under relevant regulatory capital\nrequirements. Net earnings for each segment is\ncalculated by applying the firmwide tax rate\nto each segment\u2019s pre-tax earnings. Management\nbelieves that this allocation provides a\nreasonable representation of each segment\u2019s\ncontribution to consolidated net earnings to\ncommon, return on average common equity and\ntotal assets. Transactions between segments\nare based on specific criteria or approximate\nthird-party rates.\n                                            \n  81    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These\nactivities expose the\nfirm to many different\nindustries and\ncounterparties, and\nmay also subject the\nfirm to a\nconcentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular central\nbank, counterparty,\nborrower or issuer,\nincluding sovereign\nissuers, or to a\nparticular\nclearinghouse or\nexchange. The firm\nseeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by\nactively monitoring\nexposures and\nobtaining collateral\nfrom counterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm\nconsiders when\ndetermining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts. Netting and\ncollateral agreements\npermit the firm to\noffset receivables and\npayables with such\ncounterparties and/or\nenable the firm to\nobtain collateral on\nan upfront or\ncontingent basis.\nThe table below\npresents the credit\nconcentrations\nincluded in trading\ncash instruments and\ninvestments.\n                                              \n  $ in               March            Decem\u2026  \n  mil\u2026        As of  2023             2022    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S.                                        \n  gov\u2026                                        \n  and     $  223,5\u2026         $  205,\u2026          \n  age\u2026                                        \n  obl\u2026                                        \n  Per\u2026                                        \n  of           14.5  %          14.3  %       \n  tot\u2026                                        \n  ass\u2026                                        \n  Non\u2026                                        \n  gov\u2026                                        \n  and     $  65,062         $  40,3\u2026          \n  age\u2026                                        \n  obl\u2026                                        \n  Per\u2026                                        \n  of            4.2  %           2.8  %       \n  tot\u2026                                        \n  ass\u2026                                        \n                                              \nIn addition, the firm\nhad $ 191.59billion as\nof March 2023 and $\n208.53billion as of\nDecember 2022 of cash\ndeposits held at\ncentral banks\n(included in cash and\ncash equivalents), of\nwhich $ 101.31billion\nas of March 2023 and $\n165.77billion as of\nDecember 2022 was held\nat the Federal\nReserve.\nAs of both March 2023\nand December 2022, the\nfirm did not have\ncredit exposure to any\nother counterparty\nthat exceeded 2% of\ntotal assets.\nCollateral obtained by\nthe firm related to\nderivative assets is\nprincipally cash and\nis held by the firm or\na third-party\ncustodian.

Note 27.\nLegal Proceedings The firm is involved in a\nnumber of judicial, regulatory and arbitration\nproceedings (including those described below)\nconcerning matters arising in connection with\nthe conduct of the firm\u2019s businesses. Many of\nthese proceedings are in early stages, and\nmany of these cases seek an indeterminate\namount of damages. Under ASC 450, an event is\n\u201creasonably possible\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the\nfuture event or events occurring is more than\nremote but less than likely\u201d and an event is\n\u201cremote\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the future event or\nevents occurring is slight.\u201d Thus, references\nto the upper end of the range of reasonably\npossible loss for cases in which the firm is\nable to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible loss mean the upper end of the range\nof loss for cases for which the firm believes\nthe risk of loss is more than slight.\n\nWith respect to matters described below for\nwhich management has been able to estimate a\nrange of reasonably possible loss where (i)\nactual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an\namount of money damages, (ii) the firm is\nbeing, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers\nin a securities offering and is not being\nindemnified by a party that the firm believes\nwill pay the full amount of any judgment, or\n(iii) the purchasers are demanding that the\nfirm repurchase securities, management has\nestimated the upper end of the range of\nreasonably possible loss based on (a) in the\ncase of (i), the amount of money damages\nclaimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the\ndifference between the initial sales price of\nthe securities that the firm sold in such\noffering and the estimated lowest subsequent\nprice of such securities prior to the action\nbeing commenced and (c) in the case of (iii),\nthe price that purchasers paid for the\nsecurities less the estimated value, if any,\nas of March 2023 of the relevant securities,\nin each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking\ninto account any other factors believed to be\nrelevant to the particular matter or matters\nof that type. As of the date hereof, the firm\nhas estimated the upper end of the range of\nreasonably possible aggregate loss for such\nmatters and for any other matters described\nbelow where management has been able to\nestimate a range of reasonably possible\naggregate loss to be approximately $\n2.5billion in excess of the aggregate reserves\nfor such matters. Management is generally\nunable to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible loss for matters other than those\nincluded in the estimate above, including\nwhere (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have\nnot claimed an amount of money damages, except\nin those instances where management can\notherwise determine an appropriate amount,\n(ii) matters are in early stages, (iii)\nmatters relate to regulatory investigations or\nreviews, except in those instances where\nmanagement can otherwise determine an\nappropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty\nas to the likelihood of a class being\ncertified or the ultimate size of the class,\n(v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of\npending appeals or motions, (vi) there are\nsignificant factual issues to be resolved,\nand/or (vii) there are novel legal issues\npresented. For example, the firm\u2019s potential\nliabilities with respect to the investigations\nand reviews described below in \u201cRegulatory\nInvestigations and Reviews and Related\nLitigation\u201d generally are not included in\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible\nloss. However, management does not believe,\nbased on currently available information, that\nthe outcomes of such other matters will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the firm\u2019s\nfinancial condition, though the outcomes could\nbe material to the firm\u2019s operating results\nfor any particular period, depending, in part,\nupon the operating results for such period.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    84  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The same Goldman Sachs entities are\nalso among the defendants named in two\nantitrust actions relating to the trading of\ninterest rate swaps, commenced in April 2016\nand June 2018, respectively, in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nNew York by three operators of swap execution\nfacilities and certain of their affiliates.\nThese actions have been consolidated for\npretrial proceedings. The complaints generally\nassert claims under federal antitrust law and\nstate common law in connection with an alleged\nconspiracy among the defendants to preclude\nexchange trading of interest rate swaps. The\ncomplaints in the individual actions also\nassert claims under state antitrust law. The\ncomplaints seek declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, as well as treble damages in an\nunspecified amount. Defendants moved to\ndismiss the class and the first individual\naction and the district court dismissed the\nstate common law claims asserted by the\nplaintiffs in the first individual action and\notherwise limited the state common law claim\nin the putative class action and the antitrust\nclaims in both actions to the period from 2013\nto 2016. On November 20, 2018, the court\ngranted in part and denied in part the\ndefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the second\nindividual action, dismissing the state common\nlaw claims for unjust enrichment and tortious\ninterference, but denying dismissal of the\nfederal and state antitrust claims. On March\n13, 2019, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion in the putative class action to amend\ntheir complaint to add allegations related to\nconduct from 2008 to 2012, but granted the\nmotion to add limited allegations from 2013 to\n2016, which the plaintiffs added in a fourth\nconsolidated amended complaint filed on March\n22, 2019.

On May 31,\n2022, the two remaining individual plaintiffs\nentered into a settlement with the defendants.\nThe firm has paid the full amount of its\ncontribution to the settlement. In connection\nwith the sale of Metro, the firm agreed to\nprovide indemnities to the buyer, including\nfor any potential liabilities for legal or\nregulatory proceedings arising out of the\nconduct of Metro\u2019s business while the firm\nowned it.

The use of\nfair value to measure\nfinancial instruments\nis fundamental to our\nrisk management\npractices and is our\nmost critical\naccounting policy.\n\nThe fair value of a\nfinancial instrument\nis the amount that\nwould be received to\nsell an asset or paid\nto transfer a\nliability in an\norderly transaction\nbetween market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date. We\nmeasure certain\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based\non its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit\nrisks). In determining\nfair value, the\nhierarchy under U.S.\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles\n(U.S. GAAP) gives (i)\nthe highest priority\nto unadjusted quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets for identical,\nunrestricted assets or\nliabilities (level 1\ninputs), (ii) the next\npriority to inputs\nother than level 1\ninputs that are\nobservable, either\ndirectly or indirectly\n(level 2 inputs), and\n(iii) the lowest\npriority to inputs\nthat cannot be\nobserved in market\nactivity (level 3\ninputs). In evaluating\nthe significance of a\nvaluation input, we\nconsider, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s\nnet risk exposure to\nthat input. Assets and\nliabilities are\nclassified in their\nentirety based on the\nlowest level of input\nthat is significant to\ntheir fair value\nmeasurement.\n\nThe fair values for\nsubstantially all of\nour financial assets\nand liabilities are\nbased on observable\nprices and inputs and\nare classified in\nlevels 1 and 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\nCertain level 2 and\nlevel 3 financial\nassets and liabilities\nmay require\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments that a\nmarket participant\nwould require to\narrive at fair value\nfor factors, such as\ncounterparty and our\ncredit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer\nrestrictions,\nliquidity and\nbid/offer spreads.\n\nInstruments classified\nin level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy are\nthose which require\none or more\nsignificant inputs\nthat are not\nobservable. Level 3\nfinancial assets\nrepresented 1.7% as of\nMarch 2023 and 1.8% as\nof December 2022 of\nour total assets.

Absent\nevidence to the\ncontrary, instruments\nclassified in level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy are\ninitially valued at\ntransaction price,\nwhich is considered to\nbe the best initial\nestimate of fair\nvalue. Subsequent to\nthe transaction date,\nwe use other\nmethodologies to\ndetermine fair value,\nwhich vary based on\nthe type of\ninstrument. Estimating\nthe fair value of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstruments requires\njudgments to be made.\nThese judgments\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Determining the\nappropriate valuation\nmethodology and/or\nmodel for each type of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstrument;\n\n\u2022 Determining model\ninputs based on an\nevaluation of all\nrelevant empirical\nmarket data, including\nprices evidenced by\nmarket transactions,\ninterest rates, credit\nspreads, volatilities\nand correlations; and\n\n\u2022 Determining\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments, including\nthose related to\nilliquidity or\ncounterparty credit\nquality.\n\nRegardless of the\nmethodology, valuation\ninputs and assumptions\nare only changed when\ncorroborated by\nsubstantive evidence.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    102  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In the event\nthat there is a\ndifference of opinion\nin situations where\nestimating the fair\nvalue of financial\ninstruments requires\njudgment (e.g.,\ncalibration to market\ncomparables or trade\ncomparison, as\ndescribed below), the\nfinal valuation\ndecision is made by\nsenior managers in\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions.

The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. We\napply judgment in\nweighting individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including our\ninternally derived\neconomic outlook,\nmarket consensus,\nrecent macroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios. Risk\nfactors for wholesale\nloans include internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators (e.g.,\nunemployment rates and\nGDP), the borrower\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its\nfinancial obligations,\nthe borrower\u2019s country\nof risk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. In\naddition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nloan-to-value ratio,\ndebt service ratio and\nhome price index. Risk\nfactors for\ninstallment and credit\ncard loans include\nFair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators.\n\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses also\nincludes qualitative\ncomponents which allow\nmanagement to reflect\nthe uncertain nature\nof economic\nforecasting, capture\nuncertainty regarding\nmodel inputs, and\naccount for model\nimprecision and\nconcentration risk.\n\nOur estimate of credit\nlosses entails\njudgment about\ncollectability at the\nreporting dates, and\nthere are\nuncertainties inherent\nin those judgments.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses is\nsubject to a\ngovernance process\nthat involves review\nand approval by senior\nmanagement within our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions. Personnel\nwithin our independent\nrisk oversight and\ncontrol functions are\nresponsible for\nforecasting the\neconomic variables\nthat underlie the\neconomic scenarios\nthat are used in the\nmodeling of expected\ncredit losses. While\nwe use the best\ninformation available\nto determine this\nestimate, future\nadjustments to the\nallowance may be\nnecessary based on,\namong other things,\nchanges in the\neconomic environment\nor variances between\nactual results and the\noriginal assumptions\nused. Loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\n\nWe also record an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on lending\ncommitments which are\nheld for investment\nthat are accounted for\nat amortized cost.\nSuch allowance is\ndetermined using the\nsame methodology as\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses, while also\ntaking into\nconsideration the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding,\nand whether such\ncommitments are\ncancellable by us.\n\nTo estimate the\npotential impact of an\nadverse macroeconomic\nenvironment on our\nallowance for credit\nlosses, we, among\nother things, compared\nthe expected credit\nlosses under the\nweighted average\nforecast used in the\ncalculation of\nallowance for credit\nlosses as of March\n2023 (which was\nweighted towards the\nbaseline and adverse\neconomic scenarios) to\nthe expected credit\nlosses under a 100%\nweighted adverse\neconomic scenario. The\nadverse economic\nscenario of the\nforecast model\nreflects a global\nrecession in the\nsecond quarter of 2023\nthrough the first\nquarter of 2024 and a\nmore aggressive\ntightening of monetary\npolicy by central\nbanks, resulting in an\neconomic contraction\nand rising\nunemployment rates. A\n100% weighting to the\nadverse economic\nscenario would have\nresulted in an\napproximate $1.0\nbillion increase in\nour allowance for\ncredit losses as of\nMarch 2023. This\nhypothetical increase\ndoes not take into\nconsideration any\npotential adjustments\nto qualitative\nreserves. The\nforecasts of\nmacroeconomic\nconditions are\ninherently uncertain\nand do not take into\naccount any other\noffsetting or\ncorrelated effects.\nThe actual credit loss\nin an adverse\nmacroeconomic\nenvironment may differ\nsignificantly from\nthis estimate.

In\naddition to the\nestimates we make in\nconnection with fair\nvalue measurements and\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses on loans\nand lending\ncommitments held for\ninvestment and\naccounted for at\namortized cost, the\nuse of estimates and\nassumptions is also\nimportant in\ndetermining\ndiscretionary\ncompensation accruals,\nthe accounting for\ngoodwill and\nidentifiable\nintangible assets,\nprovisions for losses\nthat may arise from\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\n(including\ngovernmental\ninvestigations), and\naccounting for income\ntaxes.\n\nA substantial portion\nof our compensation\nand benefits\nrepresents\ndiscretionary\ncompensation, which is\nfinalized at year-end.\nWe believe the most\nappropriate way to\nallocate estimated\nyear-end discretionary\ncompensation among\ninterim periods is in\nproportion to the net\nrevenues net of\nprovision for credit\nlosses earned in such\nperiods.

The\ngoodwill related to\nthe Consumer platforms\nreporting unit was\n$504 million as of\nMarch 2023 and $482\nmillion as of December\n2022. See Note 12 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about\ngoodwill. If we\nexperience a prolonged\nor severe period of\nweakness in the\nbusiness environment,\nfinancial markets, the\nperformance of one or\nmore of our reporting\nunits or our common\nstock price, or\nadditional increases\nin capital\nrequirements, our\ngoodwill could be\nimpaired in the\nfuture.\n\nIdentifiable\nintangible assets are\ntested for impairment\nwhen events or changes\nin circumstances\nsuggest that an\nasset\u2019s or asset\ngroup\u2019s carrying value\nmay not be fully\nrecoverable. Judgment\nis required to\nevaluate whether\nindications of\npotential impairment\nhave occurred, and to\ntest identifiable\nintangible assets for\nimpairment, if\nrequired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated undiscounted\ncash flows relating to\nthe asset or asset\ngroup is less than the\ncorresponding carrying\nvalue. We will\nevaluate any impact\nwith respect to the\npotential sale of\nGreenSky to determine\nwhether an impairment\nis required in the\nfuture. See Note 12 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about\nidentifiable\nintangible assets.\n\nWe also estimate and\nprovide for potential\nlosses that may arise\nout of litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nto the extent that\nsuch losses are\nprobable and can be\nreasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we\nestimate the upper end\nof the range of\nreasonably possible\naggregate loss in\nexcess of the related\nreserves for\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nwhere we believe the\nrisk of loss is more\nthan slight. See Notes\n18 and 27 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for\ninformation about\ncertain judicial,\nlitigation and\nregulatory\nproceedings.\nSignificant judgment\nis required in making\nthese estimates and\nour final liabilities\nmay ultimately be\nmaterially different.\nOur total estimated\nliability in respect\nof litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nis determined on a\ncase-by-case basis and\nrepresents an estimate\nof probable losses\nafter considering,\namong other factors,\nthe progress of each\ncase, proceeding or\ninvestigation, our\nexperience and the\nexperience of others\nin similar cases,\nproceedings or\ninvestigations, and\nthe opinions and views\nof legal counsel.\n\nIn accounting for\nincome taxes, we\nrecognize tax\npositions in the\nfinancial statements\nonly when it is more\nlikely than not that\nthe position will be\nsustained on\nexamination by the\nrelevant taxing\nauthority based on the\ntechnical merits of\nthe position. We use\nestimates to recognize\ncurrent and deferred\nincome taxes in the\nU.S. federal, state\nand local and non-U.S.\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate. The income\ntax laws in these\njurisdictions are\ncomplex and can be\nsubject to different\ninterpretations\nbetween taxpayers and\ntaxing authorities.\nDisputes may arise\nover these\ninterpretations and\ncan be settled by\naudit, administrative\nappeals or judicial\nproceedings. Our\ninterpretations are\nreevaluated quarterly\nbased on guidance\ncurrently available,\ntax examination\nexperience and the\nopinions of legal\ncounsel, among other\nfactors. We recognize\ndeferred taxes based\non the amount that\nwill more likely than\nnot be realized in the\nfuture based on\nenacted income tax\nlaws. Our estimate for\ndeferred taxes\nincludes estimates for\nfuture taxable\nearnings, including\nthe level and\ncharacter of those\nearnings, and various\ntax planning\nstrategies.

Net revenues in\nthe consolidated\nstatements of earnings\nwere $12.22 billion\nfor the first quarter\nof 2023, 5% lower than\nthe first quarter of\n2022, primarily\nreflecting lower\nmarket making revenues\nand significantly\nlower investment\nbanking revenues,\npartially offset by\nhigher investment\nmanagement revenues\nand net gains in other\nprincipal transactions\nnet revenues compared\nwith net losses in the\nprior year period.\nNon-Interest Revenues.\nInvestment banking\nrevenues in the\nconsolidated stateme\nnts of earnings were\n$1.58 billion for the\nfirst quarter of 2023,\n26% lower than the\nfirst quarter of 2022,\nprimarily due to\nsignificantly lower\nrevenues in Advisory,\nreflecting a\nsignificant decline in\nindustry-wide\ncompleted mergers and\nacquisitions\ntransactions, and Debt\nunderwriting,\nreflecting a decline\nin industry-wide\nvolumes. Investment\nmanagement revenues in\nthe consolidated\nstatements of earnings\nwere $2.29 billion for\nthe first quarter of\n2023, 11% higher than\nthe first quarter of\n2022, due to higher\nManagement and other\nfees, primarily\nreflecting the\ninclusion of NNIP and\na reduction in fee\nwaivers on money\nmarket funds.\nCommissions and fees\nin the consolidated\nstatements of earnings\nwere $1.09 billion for\nthe first quarter of\n2023, 8% higher than\nthe first quarter of\n2022, primarily\nreflecting the\ninclusion of GreenSky\nand higher commissions\nand fees in Equities.\nMarket making revenues\nin the consolidated\nstatements of earnings\nwere $5.43 billion for\nthe first quarter of\n2023, 10% lower than a\nstrong first quarter\nof 2022, primarily\nreflecting\nsignificantly lower\nrevenues in currencies\nand commodities and\nlower revenues in\nequity products,\npartially offset by\nsignificantly higher\nnet revenues in\ninterest rate products\nand improved results\nin mortgages.\n\nOther principal\ntransactions revenues\nin the consolidated\nstatements of earnings\nwere $55 million for\nthe first quarter of\n2023, compared with a\nnegative $140 million\nfor the first quarter\nof 2022, primarily\nreflecting mark-to-\nmarket net gains from\ninvestments in public\nequities compared with\nsignificant mark-to-\nmarket net losses in\nthe prior year period,\npartially offset by a\nloss of approximately\n$470 million related\nto a partial sale of\nthe Marcus loans\nportfolio and the\ntransfer of the\nremainder of the\nportfolio to held for\nsale (largely offset\nby a related reserve\nreduction in provision\nfor credit losses).\nNet Interest Income.\nNet interest income in\nthe consolidated\nstatements of earnings\nwas $1.78 billion for\nthe first quarter of\n2023, 3% lower than\nthe first quarter of\n2022, reflecting an\nincrease in interest\nexpense primarily\nrelated to other\ninterest-bearing\nliabilities, deposits,\ncollateralized\nfinancings, and\nborrowings, each\nreflecting the impact\nof higher average\ninterest rates. The\nincrease in interest\nexpense was largely\noffset by an increase\nin interest income\nprimarily related to\ncollateralized\nagreements, other\ninterest-earning\nassets, deposits with\nbanks, and loans, each\nreflecting the impact\nof higher average\ninterest rates.

In\naddition, we maintain\n(i) market-making\npositions, typically\nfor a short period of\ntime, in response to,\nor in anticipation of,\nclient demand, and\n(ii) positions to\nactively manage our\nrisk exposures that\narise from these\nmarket-making\nactivities\n(collectively,\ninventory). Our\ninventory is recorded\nin trading assets\n(long positions) or\ntrading liabilities\n(short positions) in\nour consolidated\nbalance sheets. Our\nresults are influenced\nby a combination of\ninterconnected\ndrivers, including (i)\nclient activity levels\nand transactional\nbid/offer spreads\n(collectively, client\nactivity), and (ii)\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of our inventory\nand interest income\nand interest expense\nrelated to the\nholding, hedging and\nfunding of our\ninventory\n(collectively, market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges). Due to the\nintegrated nature of\nour market-making\nactivities,\ndisaggregation of net\nrevenues into client\nactivity and market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges is judgmental\nand has inherent\ncomplexities and\nlimitations. The\namount and composition\nof our net revenues\nvary over time as\nthese drivers are\nimpacted by multiple\ninterrelated factors\naffecting economic and\nmarket conditions,\nincluding volatility\nand liquidity in the\nmarket, changes in\ninterest rates,\ncurrency exchange\nrates, credit spreads,\nequity prices and\ncommodity prices,\ninvestor confidence,\nand other\nmacroeconomic concerns\nand uncertainties. In\ngeneral, assuming all\nother market-making\nconditions remain\nconstant, increases in\nclient activity levels\nor bid/offer spreads\ntend to result in\nincreases in net\nrevenues, and\ndecreases tend to have\nthe opposite effect.\nHowever, changes in\nmarket-making\nconditions can\nmaterially impact\nclient activity levels\nand bid/offer spreads,\nas well as the fair\nvalue of our\ninventory.

Transaction volumes may\nnot be indicative of net revenues in a given\nperiod. In addition, transaction volumes for\nprior periods may vary from amounts previously\nreported due to the subsequent withdrawal or a\nchange in the value of a transaction. \u2022 Equity\nand equity-related offerings includes Rule\n144A and public common stock offerings,\nconvertible offerings and rights offerings. \u2022\nDebt offerings includes non-convertible\npreferred stock, mortgage-backed securities,\nasset-backed securities and taxable municipal\ndebt.

During the first\nquarter of 2023, Global Banking & Markets\noperated in an environment generally\ncharacterized by continued broad macroeconomic\nand geopolitical concerns, as well as the\neffects of stress in the banking sector,\nincluding a period of high interest rate\nvolatility. These factors contributed to solid\nmarket-making activity levels, but negatively\naffected industry-wide investment banking\nactivity levels. In investment banking,\nindustry-wide debt underwriting and equity\nunderwriting volumes improved compared with\nthe fourth quarter of 2022, but remained below\nhistorical averages. Additionally, industry-\nwide mergers and acquisitions transactions\ncontinued to decline from elevated levels in\nthe prior year. In interest rates, the yield\nfor 2-year U.S. Treasury notes moved over 15\nbasis points per day for a period of seven\nconsecutive days during March. In equities,\nthe S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index both\nincreased by 7%, compared with the end of\n2022. In the future, if market and economic\nconditions deteriorate further, and activity\nlevels or volatility decline, or credit\nspreads related to hedges on our relationship\nlending portfolio tighten, net revenues in\nGlobal Banking & Market would likely be\nnegatively impacted. In addition, if economic\nconditions deteriorate further or if the\ncreditworthiness of borrowers deteriorates,\nprovision for credit losses would likely be\nnegatively impacted. Three Months Ended March\n2023 versus March 2022. Net revenues in Global\nBanking & Markets were $8.44 billion for the\nfirst quarter of 2023, 16% lower than a strong\nfirst quarter of 2022. Investment banking fees\nwere $1.58 billion, 26% lower than the first\nquarter of 2022, primarily due to\nsignificantly lower net revenues in Advisory,\nreflecting a significant decline in industry-\nwide completed mergers and acquisitions\ntransactions, and Debt underwriting,\nreflecting a decline in industry-wide volumes.\nAs of March 2023, our Investment banking fees\nbacklog decreased compared with December 2022,\nprimarily due to lower estimated net revenues\nfrom potential advisory transactions.\nEstimated net revenues from potential equity\nunderwriting transactions and debt\nunderwriting transactions were also lower.\n                                             \n  111    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During the first\nquarter of 2023, Asset & Wealth Management\noperated in an environment generally\ncharacterized by continued broad macroeconomic\nand geopolitical concerns, although signs of\nimprovements in economic conditions\ncontributed to an increase in asset prices\ncompared with the end of 2022, positively\naffecting assets under supervision. In\naddition, concerns about the stability of U.S.\nregional banks resulted in outflows of\nuninsured deposits from at-risk regional\nbanks, and money market funds experienced\nsignificant inflows. In addition, the\ncommercial real estate market faced increased\npressure. In the future, if market and\neconomic conditions deteriorate further, it\nmay lead to a decline in asset prices, or\ninvestors transitioning to asset classes that\ntypically generate lower fees or withdrawing\ntheir assets, and net revenues in Asset &\nWealth Management would likely continue to be\nnegatively impacted.\n\nThree Months Ended March 2023 ver sus March\n2022. Net revenues in Asset & Wealth\nManagement were $3.22 billion for the first\nquarter of 2023, 24% higher than the first\nquarter of 2022, reflecting net gains in\nEquity investments compared with net losses in\nthe prior year period, higher Management and\nother fees and higher net revenues in Debt\ninvestments. Net revenues in Private banking\nand lending included a loss of approximately\n$470 million related to a partial sale of the\nMarcus loans portfolio and the transfer of the\nremainder of the portfolio to held for sale\n(largely offset by a related reserve reduction\nof approximately $440 million in provision for\ncredit losses). The increase in Equity\ninvestments net revenues reflected mark-to-\nmarket net gains from investments in public\nequities compared with significant mark-to-\nmarket net losses in the prior year period,\npartially offset by significantly lower net\ngains from investments in private equities.\nThe increase in Management and other fees\nprimarily reflected the inclusion of NNIP and\na reduction in fee waivers on money market\nfunds. The increase in Debt investments net\nrevenues reflected net mark-ups compared with\nnet mark-downs in the prior year period. Net\nrevenues in Private banking and lending were\nsignificantly lower, due to the loss related\nto the Marcus loans portfolio, partially\noffset by the impact of higher deposit\nspreads. Incentive fees were also lower.\nProvision for credit losses was a net benefit\nof $565 million for the first quarter of 2023,\ncompared with net provisions of $203 million\nfor the first quarter of 2022. The net benefit\nfor the first quarter of 2023 primarily\nreflected a reserve reduction related to a\npartial sale of the Marcus loans portfolio and\nthe transfer of the remainder of the portfolio\nto held for sale, while provisions for the\nfirst quarter of 2022 reflected portfolio\ngrowth, the impact of macroeconomic and\ngeopolitical concerns, and individual\nimpairments. Operating expenses were $3.17\nbillion for the first quarter of 2023, 32%\nhigher than the first quarter of 2022,\nprimarily due to impairments of approximately\n$355 million related to consolidated real\nestate investments, the inclusion of NNIP and\nhigher compensation and benefits expenses.\nPre-tax earnings were $613 million for the\nfirst quarter of 2023, compared with a pre-tax\nloss of $9 million for the first quarter of\n2022.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    114  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During the first\nquarter of 2023, Platform Solutions operated\nin an environment generally characterized by\ncontinued broad macroeconomic concerns,\nalthough the environment was positively\nimpacted by improvement in inflationary\nmeasures. In the U.S., the rate of\nunemployment remained low and consumer\nspending increased slightly compared with the\nfourth quarter of 2022, while the pace of\nmonetary policy tightening slowed. In the\nfuture, if market and economic conditions\ndeteriorate further, it may lead to a decrease\nin consumer spending or a deterioration in\nconsumer credit, and net revenues and\nprovision for credit losses in Platform\nSolutions would likely be negatively impacted.\nThree Months Ended March 2023 ve rsus March\n2022. Net revenues in Platform Solutions were\n$564 million for the first quarter of 2023,\n110% higher than the first quarter of 2022,\nreflecting significantly higher net revenues\nin Consumer platforms. The increase in\nConsumer platforms net revenues primarily\nreflected significantly higher average credit\ncard balances. Transaction banking and other\nnet revenues were also higher, reflecting\nhigher average deposit balances. Provision for\ncredit losses was $265 million for the first\nquarter of 2023, 59% higher than the first\nquarter of 2022. Provisions for the first\nquarter of 2023 reflected net charge-offs\nrelated to the credit card portfolio and\ngrowth in the point-of-sale loan portfolio,\npartially offset by reserve releases based on\nactual repayment experience, while provisions\nfor the first quarter of 2022 primarily\nreflected growth in the credit card portfolio.\nOperating expenses were $605 million for the\nfirst quarter of 2023, 81% higher than the\nfirst quarter of 2022, primarily due to\nsignificantly higher compensation and benefits\nexpenses and the inclusion of GreenSky. Pre-\ntax loss was $306 million for the first\nquarter of 2023, compared with a pre-tax loss\nof $233 million for the first quarter of 2022.\nGeographic Data See Note 25 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for a\nsummary of our total net revenues and pre-tax\nearnings by geographic region.\n                                             \n  119    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We believe that our\nrelationships with our creditors are critical\nto our liquidity. Our creditors include banks,\ngovernments, securities lenders, corporations,\npension funds, insurance companies, mutual\nfunds and individuals. We have imposed various\ninternal guidelines to monitor creditor\nconcentration across our funding programs.\nDeposits. Our deposits provide us with a\ndiversified source of funding and reduce our\nreliance on wholesale funding. We raise\ndeposits, including savings, demand and time\ndeposits, from private bank clients,\nconsumers, transaction banking clients, other\ninstitutional clients, and through internal\nand third-party broker-dealers. Substantially\nall of our deposits are raised through Goldman\nSachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA), Goldman Sachs\nInternational Bank (GSIB) and Goldman Sachs\nBank Europe SE (GSBE). See Note 13 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about our deposits, including a\nmaturity profile of our time deposits.\n\nSecured Funding. We fund a significant amount\nof inventory and a portion of investments on a\nsecured basis. Secured funding includes\ncollateralized financings in the consolidated\nbalance sheets. See Note 11 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about our collateralized\nfinancings, including its maturity profile. We\nmay also pledge our inventory and investments\nas collateral for securities borrowed under a\nsecurities lending agreement. We also use our\nown inventory and investments to cover\ntransactions in which we or our clients have\nsold securities that have not yet been\npurchased. Secured funding is less sensitive\nto changes in our credit quality than\nunsecured funding, due to our posting of\ncollateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we\nanalyze the refinancing risk of our secured\nfunding activities, taking into account trade\ntenors, maturity profiles, counterparty\nconcentrations, collateral eligibility and\ncounterparty rollover probabilities. We seek\nto mitigate our refinancing risk by executing\nterm trades with staggered maturities,\ndiversifying counterparties, raising excess\nsecured funding and pre-funding residual risk\nthrough our GCLA. We seek to raise secured\nfunding with a term appropriate for the\nliquidity of the assets that are being\nfinanced, and we seek longer maturities for\nsecured funding collateralized by asset\nclasses that may be harder to fund on a\nsecured basis, especially during times of\nmarket stress. Our secured funding, excluding\nfunding collateralized by liquid government\nand agency obligations, is primarily executed\nfor tenors of one month or greater and is\nprimarily executed through term repurchase\nagreements and securities loaned contracts.\nAssets that may be harder to fund on a secured\nbasis during times of market stress include\ncertain financial instruments in the following\ncategories: mortgage- and other asset-backed\nloans and securities, non-investment-grade\ncorporate debt securities, equity securities\nand emerging market securities. We also raise\nfinancing through other types of\ncollateralized financings, such as secured\nloans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to\nfunding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Our\noutstanding borrowings from the Federal Home\nLoan Bank were $4.41 billion as of March 2023\nand we had no outstanding borrowings as of\nDecember 2022. Additionally, we have access to\nfunding through the Federal Reserve discount\nwindow. However, we do not rely on this\nfunding in our liquidity planning and stress\ntesting.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    122  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We have in place a comprehensive capital\nmanagement policy that provides a framework,\ndefines objectives and establishes guidelines\nto assist us in maintaining the appropriate\nlevel and composition of capital in both\nbusiness-as-usual and stressed conditions.\nCapital Management We determine the\nappropriate amount and composition of our\ncapital by considering multiple factors,\nincluding our current and future regulatory\ncapital requirements, the results of our\ncapital planning and stress testing process,\nthe results of resolution capital models and\nother factors, such as rating agency\nguidelines, subsidiary capital requirements,\nthe business environment and conditions in the\nfinancial markets. We manage our capital\nrequirements and the levels of our capital\nusage principally by setting limits on the\nbalance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each\ncase at both the firmwide and business levels.\nWe principally manage the level and\ncomposition of our capital through issuances\nand repurchases of our common stock. We may\nissue, redeem or repurchase our preferred\nstock and subordinated debt or other forms of\ncapital as business conditions warrant. Prior\nto such redemptions or repurchases, we must\nreceive approval from the FRB. See Notes 14\nand 19 to the consolidated financial\nstatements for further information about our\npreferred stock and subordinated debt. Capital\nPlanning and Stress Testing Process. As part\nof capital planning, we project sources and\nuses of capital given a range of business\nenvironments, including stressed conditions.\nOur stress testing process is designed to\nidentify and measure material risks associated\nwith our business activities, including market\nrisk, credit risk, operational risk and\nliquidity risk, as well as our ability to\ngenerate revenues. Our capital planning\nprocess incorporates an internal capital\nadequacy assessment with the objective of\nensuring that we are appropriately capitalized\nrelative to the risks in our businesses. We\nincorporate stress scenarios into our capital\nplanning process with a goal of holding\nsufficient capital to ensure we remain\nadequately capitalized after experiencing a\nsevere stress event. Our assessment of capital\nadequacy is viewed in tandem with our\nassessment of liquidity adequacy and is\nintegrated into our overall risk management\nstructure, governance and policy framework.\n                                             \n  123    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We provide\nfurther information\nabout our stress test\nprocesses and a\nsummary of the results\non our website as\ndescribed in\n\u201cAvailable\nInformation.\u201d\n\nAs required by the\nFRB\u2019s CCAR rules, we\nsubmit an annual\ncapital plan for\nreview by the FRB. The\npurpose of the FRB\u2019s\nreview is to ensure\nthat we have a robust,\nforward-looking\ncapital planning\nprocess that accounts\nfor our unique risks\nand that permits\ncontinued operation\nduring times of\neconomic and financial\nstress.\n\nThe FRB evaluates us\nbased, in part, on\nwhether we have the\ncapital necessary to\ncontinue operating\nunder the baseline and\nseverely adverse\nscenarios provided by\nthe FRB and those\ndeveloped internally.\nThis evaluation also\ntakes into account our\nprocess for\nidentifying risk, our\ncontrols and\ngovernance for capital\nplanning, and our\nguidelines for making\ncapital planning\ndecisions. In\naddition, the FRB\nevaluates our plan to\nmake capital\ndistributions (i.e.,\ndividend payments and\nrepurchases or\nredemptions of stock,\nsubordinated debt or\nother capital\nsecurities) and issue\ncapital, across the\nrange of macroeconomic\nscenarios and firm-\nspecific assumptions.\nThe FRB determines the\nstress capital buffer\n(SCB) applicable to us\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\nThe SCB under the\nStandardized approach\nis calculated as (i)\nthe difference between\nour starting and\nminimum projected CET1\ncapital ratios under\nthe supervisory\nseverely adverse\nscenario and (ii) our\nplanned common stock\ndividends for each of\nthe fourth through\nseventh quarters of\nthe planning horizon,\nexpressed as a\npercentage of risk-\nweighted assets\n(RWAs).\n\nBased on our 2022 CCAR\nsubmission, the FRB\nreduced our SCB from\n6.4% to 6.3% for the\nperiod from October 1,\n2022 through September\n30, 2023. As a result,\nbeginning on October\n1, 2022, our\nStandardized CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement was 13.3%.\nAdditionally,\neffective January 1,\n2023, our global\nsystemically important\nbank (G-SIB) surcharge\nincreased from 2.5% to\n3.0%, resulting in a\nStandardized CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement of 13.8%.\nSee \u201cShare Repurchase\nProgram\u201d for further\ninformation about\ncommon stock\nrepurchases and\ndividends and\n\u201cConsolidated\nRegulatory Capital\u201d\nfor further\ninformation about the\nG-SIB surcharge.

GS\nBank USA submitted its\n2023 DFAST capital\nplan to the FRB in\nApril 2023 and expects\nto publish a summary\nof its annual DFAST\nresults in June 2023.\nSee \u201cAvailable\nInformation.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs\nInternational (GSI),\nGSIB and GSBE also\nhave their own capital\nplanning and stress\ntesting processes,\nwhich incorporate\ninternally designed\nstress tests developed\nin accordance with the\nguidelines of their\nrespective regulators.\n\nContingency Capital\nPlan. As part of our\ncomprehensive capital\nmanagement policy, we\nmaintain a contingency\ncapital plan. Our\ncontingency capital\nplan provides a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nperceived or actual\ncapital deficiency,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to,\nidentification of\ndrivers of a capital\ndeficiency, as well as\nmitigants and\npotential actions. It\noutlines the\nappropriate\ncommunication\nprocedures to follow\nduring a crisis\nperiod, including\ninternal dissemination\nof information, as\nwell as timely\ncommunication with\nexternal stakeholders.\n\nCapital Attribution.\nWe assess the capital\nusage of each of our\nbusinesses based on\nour attributed equity\nframework. This\nframework considers\nmany factors,\nincluding our internal\nassessment of risks as\nwell as the regulatory\ncapital requirements\nrelated to our\nbusiness activities.\nThese regulatory\ncapital requirements\ntake into\nconsideration our most\nbinding capital\nconstraints. Our most\nbinding capital\nconstraint is our CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement under the\nStandardized Capital\nRules. This\nrequirement includes\nthe SCB which is\ndetermined by the FRB\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\n\nShare Repurchase\nProgram. We use our\nshare repurchase\nprogram to help\nmaintain the\nappropriate level of\ncommon equity. The\nrepurchase program is\neffected primarily\nthrough regular open-\nmarket purchases\n(which may include\nrepurchase plans\ndesigned to comply\nwith Rule 10b5-1 and\naccelerated share\nrepurchases), the\namounts and timing of\nwhich are determined\nprimarily by our\ncurrent and projected\ncapital position and\nour capital plan\nsubmitted to the FRB\nas part of CCAR. The\namounts and timing of\nthe repurchases may\nalso be influenced by\ngeneral market\nconditions and the\nprevailing price and\ntrading volumes of our\ncommon stock.\n\nDuring the first\nquarter of 2023, we\nreturned a total of\n$3.41 billion to\nshareholders,\nincluding common stock\nrepurchases of $2.55\nbillion and common\nstock dividends of\n$868 million.\nConsistent with our\ncapital management\nphilosophy, we will\ncontinue prioritizing\ndeployment of capital\nfor our clients where\nreturns are attractive\nand return any excess\ncapital to\nshareholders through\ndividends and share\nrepurchases. However,\nwe expect to moderate\nour stock repurchase\nlevels in the second\nquarter of 2023\nrelative to the first\nquarter of 2023.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    124  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The Inflation\nReduction Act of 2022\nenacted a one percent\nnon-deductible excise\ntax (buyback tax) on\nthe fair market value\nof certain corporate\nshare repurchases\nafter December 31,\n2022. The fair market\nvalue of share\nrepurchases subject to\nthe tax is reduced by\nthe fair market value\nof any stock issued\nduring the calendar\nyear, including stock\nissued to employees.\nThe buyback tax did\nnot have a material\nimpact on our\nfinancial condition,\nresults of operations\nor cash flows for the\nthree months ended\nMarch 2023. Resolution\nCapital Models. In\nconnection with our\nresolution planning\nefforts, we have\nestablished a\nResolution Capital\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich is designed to\nensure that our major\nsubsidiaries (GS Bank\nUSA, Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI,\nGSIB, GSBE, Goldman\nSachs Japan Co., Ltd.\n(GSJCL), Goldman Sachs\nAsset Management, L.P.\nand Goldman Sachs\nAsset Management\nInternational) have\naccess to sufficient\nloss-absorbing\ncapacity (in the form\nof equity,\nsubordinated debt and\nunsecured senior debt)\nso that they are able\nto wind down following\na Group Inc.\nbankruptcy filing in\naccordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy. In addition,\nwe have established a\ntriggers and alerts\nframework, which is\ndesigned to provide\nthe Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc. Rating\nAgency Guidelines The\ncredit rating agencies\nassign credit ratings\nto the obligations of\nGroup Inc., which\ndirectly issues or\nguarantees\nsubstantially all of\nour senior unsecured\ndebt obligations.\nGS&Co. and GSI have\nbeen assigned long-\nand short-term issuer\nratings by certain\ncredit rating\nagencies. GS Bank USA,\nGSIB and GSBE have\nalso been assigned\nlong- and short-term\nissuer ratings, as\nwell as ratings on\ntheir long- and short-\nterm bank deposits. In\naddition, credit\nrating agencies have\nassigned ratings to\ndebt obligations of\ncertain other\nsubsidiaries of Group\nInc.\n\nThe level and\ncomposition of our\ncapital are among the\nmany factors\nconsidered in\ndetermining our credit\nratings. Each agency\nhas its own definition\nof eligible capital\nand methodology for\nevaluating capital\nadequacy, and\nassessments are\ngenerally based on a\ncombination of factors\nrather than a single\ncalculation.

Our\nG-SIB surcharge is\n3.0% for 2023 and\n2024. The G-SIB\nsurcharge and\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer in the\nfuture may differ due\nto additional guidance\nfrom our regulators\nand/or positional\nchanges, and our SCB\nis likely to change\nfrom year to year\nbased on the results\nof the annual\nsupervisory stress\ntests. Our target is\nto maintain capital\nratios equal to the\nregulatory\nrequirements plus a\nbuffer of 50 to 100\nbasis points. See Note\n20 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about our\nrisk-based capital\nratios and leverage\nratios, and the\nCapital Framework.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity (TLAC) We are\nalso subject to the\nFRB\u2019s TLAC and related\nrequirements.

GS&Co., our primary U.S.\nregulated broker-dealer subsidiary, is also a\nregistered futures commission merchant and a\nregistered swap dealer with the CFTC, and a\nregistered security-based swap dealer with the\nSEC, and therefore is subject to regulatory\ncapital requirements imposed by the SEC, the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.,\nthe CFTC, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and\nthe National Futures Association. Rule 15c3-1\nof the SEC and Rules 1.17 and Part 23 Subpart\nE of the CFTC specify uniform minimum net\ncapital requirements, as defined, for their\nregistrants, and also effectively require that\na significant part of the registrants\u2019 assets\nbe kept in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. has\nelected to calculate its minimum capital\nrequirements in accordance with the\n\u201cAlternative Net Capital Requirement\u201d as\npermitted by Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC. GS&Co.\nhad regulatory net capital, as defined by Rule\n15c3-1, of $22.53 billion as of March 2023 and\n$22.21 billion as of December 2022, which\nexceeded the amount required by $17.67 billion\nas of March 2023 and $17.46 billion as of\nDecember 2022. In addition to its alternative\nminimum net capital requirements, GS&Co. is\nalso required to hold tentative net capital in\nexcess of $5 billion and net capital in excess\nof $1 billion in accordance with Rule 15c3-1.\nGS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in\nthe event that its tentative net capital is\nless than $6 billion. As of both March 2023\nand December 2022, GS&Co. had tentative net\ncapital and net capital in excess of both the\nminimum and the notification requirements.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    126  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

On\nJanuary 1, 2022, the\npublication of all\nEUR, CHF, JPY and GBP\nLIBOR (non-USD LIBOR)\nsettings along with\ncertain USD LIBOR\nsettings ceased. The\npublication of the\nmost commonly used USD\nLIBOR settings as\nrepresentative rates\nwill cease after June\n2023. The FCA has\nallowed the\npublication and use of\nsynthetic rates for\ncertain GBP LIBOR\nsettings in legacy GBP\nLIBOR-based derivative\ncontracts through\nMarch 2024. The FCA\nwill allow the\npublication and use of\nsynthetic rates for\ncertain USD LIBOR\nsettings in legacy USD\nLIBOR-based derivative\ncontracts through\nSeptember 2024. The\nU.S. federal banking\nagencies\u2019 guidance\nstrongly encourages\nbanking organizations\nto cease using USD\nLIBOR.\n\nThe International\nSwaps and Derivatives\nAsso ciation (ISDA)\n2020 IBOR Fallbacks\nProtocol (IBOR\nProtocol) has provided\nderivatives market\nparticipants with\namended fallbacks for\nlegacy and new\nderivative contracts\nto mitigate legal or\neconomic uncertainty.\nBoth counterparties\nhave to adhere to the\nIBOR Protocol or\nengage in bilateral\namendments for the\nterms to be effective\nfor derivative\ncontracts. ISDA has\nconfirmed that the\nFCA\u2019s formal\nannouncement to cease\nboth non-USD and USD\nLIBOR settings fixed\nthe spread adjustment\nfor all LIBOR rates\nand as a result\nfallbacks applied\nautomatically for non-\nUSD LIBOR settings\nfollowing December 31,\n2021 and will apply\nautomatically for USD\nLIBOR settings\nfollowing June 30,\n2023. The Adjustable\nInterest Rate (LIBOR)\nAct, that was enacted\nin March 2022,\nprovides a statutory\nframework to replace\nUSD LIBOR with a\nbenchmark rate based\non the Secured\nOvernight Financing\nRate (SOFR) for\ncontracts governed by\nU.S. law that have no\nfallbacks or fallbacks\nthat would require the\nuse of a poll or\nLIBOR-based rate. In\nDecember 2022, the FRB\nadopted a final rule\nthat implements the\nLIBOR Act, which\nbecame effective in\nFebruary 2023. The\nfinal rule identifies\ndifferent SOFR-based\nreplacement rates for\nderivative contracts,\nfor cash instruments\nsuch as floating-rate\nnotes and preferred\nstock, for consumer\ncontracts, for certain\ngovernment-sponsored\nenterprise contracts\nand for certain\nstudent loan\nsecuritizations that\nlack a fallback to an\nalternative rate when\nUSD LIBOR ceases to be\npublished on June 30,\n2023.\n\nWe facilitated an\norderly transition\nfrom non-USD LIBORs to\nalternative risk-free\nreference rates and\nsynthetic rates for us\nand our clients, and\ncontinue to make\nprogress on our\ntransition program as\nit relates to USD\nLIBOR.\n\nOur risk exposure to\nUSD LIBOR is primarily\nin connection with our\nderivative contracts\nand, to a lesser\nextent, our unsecured\ndebt, preferred stock\nand loan portfolio. As\nof March 2023, the\nnotional amount of our\nUSD LIBOR-based\nderivative contracts\nwas approximately $5\ntrillion,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich will mature\nafter June 2023 based\non their contractual\nterms. Substantially\nall of such derivative\ncontracts are with\ncounterparties under\nbilateral agreements\nsubject to the IBOR\nProtocol, or with\ncentral clearing\ncounterparties or\nexchanges which have\nincorporated fallbacks\nconsistent with the\nIBOR Protocol in their\nrulebooks and have\nannounced that they\nplan to convert USD\nLIBOR contracts to\nalternative risk-free\nreference rates. Our\nunsecured benchmark\ndebt and preferred\nstock with USD LIBOR\nexposure was\napproximately $26.4\nbillion as of March\n2023, all of which\nwill contractually\nmature after June 2023\nor is perpetual and\nhas no stated maturity\ndate. Under the FRB\u2019s\nfinal rule and the\nLIBOR Act, we will\nreplace our USD LIBOR-\nbased unsecured\nbenchmark debt and\npreferred stock with\nterm SOFR plus the\nstatutorily prescribed\ntenor spread. This\ntransition will take\nplace following USD\nLIBOR cessation on\nJune 30, 2023. In\naddition, our USD\nLIBOR-based loans were\napproximately $28.4\nbillion as of March\n2023, of which\napproximately $27.0\nbillion will mature\nafter June 2023 based\non their contractual\nterms. A vast majority\nof such loans contain\nfallback provisions in\nthe related loan\nagreements and we are\nactively engaging with\nour clients and\nsyndicate partners to\nremediate the\nremaining loan\nagreements.\n\nWe have also issued de\nbt and deposits linked\nto SOFR and Sterling\nOvernight Index\nAverage (SONIA) and\nexecuted SOFR- and\nSONIA-based derivative\ncontracts to make\nmarkets, facilitate\nclient activities, and\nin connection with our\nrisk management\nactivities. When\nappropriate, we\ncontinue to execute\ntransactions in the\nmarket to reduce our\nUSD LIBOR exposures\narising from hedges to\nour fixed-rate debt\nissuances and replace\nthem with alternative\nrisk-free reference\nrate exposures.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    128  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During the\nfirst quarter of 2023,\nSilicon Valley Bank\n(SVB) and Signature\nBank (Signature), two\nregional banks in the\nU.S., experienced\nlarge deposit outflows\nthat ultimately\nresulted in the\nfailure of these banks\nin March 2023 and the\nappointment of the\nFDIC as receiver for\nthem. The collapse of\nthese banks created\nconcerns regarding the\npossibility that other\nbanks might also\nencounter liquidity\nproblems that would\ntrigger additional\nfailures. The FDIC\nguaranteed all\ndeposits in SVB and\nSignature, including\nuninsured deposits. In\naddition, the Federal\nReserve announced the\ncreation of the Bank\nTerm Funding Program\n(BTFP), which offers\nloans of up to one\nyear (secured by\neligible collateral\nvalued at par) to\nbanks and other\neligible institutions.\nFirst Republic,\nanother U.S. regional\nbank, also experienced\nlarge withdrawals of\ndeposits, raising\nconcerns about its\nfinancial stability.\nIn response to the\nmounting concerns\nregarding First\nRepublic, a consortium\nof 11 banks agreed to\nprovide support to\nFirst Republic through\nan aggregate $30\nbillion deposit. We\nare a member of this\nconsortium and made a\ndeposit of $2.5\nbillion. On May 1,\n2023, First Republic\nwas placed under FDIC\nreceivership, and the\nFDIC entered into a\npurchase and\nassumption agreement\nwith JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. under which\nJPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. will assume all\nof the deposits,\nincluding uninsured\ndeposits, and\nsubstantially all of\nthe assets of First\nRepublic.\n\nThe FDIC has indicated\nthat it expects to\nissue a proposed\nrulemaking for public\ncomment in May 2023\nregarding one or more\nspecial assessments on\ndepository\ninstitutions,\ndepository holding\ncompanies, or both, as\ndetermined by the\nFDIC, to recover the\nlosses to the Deposit\nInsurance Fund that\nare attributable to\nthe costs of covering\nuninsured deposits of\nSVB and Signature. It\nis also possible that\nthe FDIC will recover\nany losses to the\nDeposit Insurance Fund\nattributable to the\nfailure of First\nRepublic through a\nspecial assessment.\nThe impact to us of\nsuch special\nassessments, which is\nnot known at this\ntime, could be\nmaterial to our\nresults of operations,\ndepending on the final\nrules issued by the\nFDIC regarding the\napplication of the\nassessments.\n\nThese stresses in the\nbanking industry were\nnot limited to the\nU.S. Concerns about\nthe solvency of Credit\nSuisse Group AG, a\nG-SIB based in\nSwitzerland, escalated\nrapidly and, as a\nresult, UBS Group AG\nand Credit Suisse\nGroup AG, working in\nconjunction with Swiss\nregulators, entered\ninto an agreement\nunder which UBS Group\nAG will acquire Credit\nSuisse Group AG.\nConcurrent with the\nnews of the\nacquisition of Credit\nSuisse Group AG by UBS\nGroup AG, several\ncentral banks,\nincluding the Federal\nReserve and the ECB,\nannounced coordinated\nefforts to enhance\nglobal access to U.S.\ndollar liquidity.\n\nA more systemic spread\nof concerns regarding\nthe financial\nstability or solvency\nof banks could\nnegatively impact our\nliquidity, results of\noperations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nThese events in the\nfirst quarter of 2023\nhave placed heightened\nfocus on the impact\nthat rising interest\nrates have had on the\nmarket values of\navailable-for-sale and\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities portfolios\nof banks. As of March\n2023, the carrying\nvalue of our\navailable-for-sale\nsecurities portfolio\nwas $48.64 billion,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich consisted of\nU.S. government\nobligations. As of\nMarch 2023, the pre-\ntax net unrealized\nlosses included in\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss) and our\nregulatory capital\nratios relating to\nthese securities were\n$2.95 billion. As of\nMarch 2023, the\ncarrying value of our\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities portfolio\nwas $53.81 billion,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich was comprised of\nU.S. government\nobligations. The pre-\ntax net unrealized\nlosses on these\nsecurities were $891\nmillion. If the\nunrealized losses on\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities had been\nrecognized as a\nreduction to our\nregulatory capital,\nthe after-tax impact\nwould have been a\nreduction of\napproximately 0.1\npercentage point to\nour regulatory capital\nratios as of March\n2023. See Note 8 for\nfurther information\nabout available-for-\nsale and held-to-\nmaturity securities.\n\nOur liquidity position\nduring the first\nquarter of 2023\nremained strong, as\nour GCLA averaged\n$398.90 billion for\nthe quarter. Our\ndeposits were $375.53\nbillion, compared with\n$386.67 billion as of\nDecember 2022. During\nMarch 2023, when\nstress in the banking\nsector became\nelevated, our deposits\nwere essentially\nunchanged. As of March\n2023, approximately\n$185.15 billion of\ndeposits were insured\nby the FDIC and $24.67\nbillion were insured\nby non-U.S. insurance\nprograms.

Overview and Structure of\nRisk Management Overview We believe that\neffective risk management is critical to our\nsuccess. Accordingly, we have established an\nenterprise risk management framework that\nemploys a comprehensive, integrated approach\nto risk management, and is designed to enable\ncomprehensive risk management processes\nthrough which we identify, assess, monitor and\nmanage the risks we assume in conducting our\nactivities. Our risk management structure is\nbuilt around three core components:\ngovernance, processes and people. Governance.\nRisk management governance starts with the\nBoard, which both directly and through its\ncommittees, including its Risk Committee,\noversees our risk management policies and\npractices implemented through the enterprise\nrisk management framework. The Board is also\nresponsible for the annual review and approval\nof our risk appetite statement. The risk\nappetite statement describes the levels and\ntypes of risk we are willing to accept or to\navoid, in order to achieve our objectives\nincluded in our strategic business plan, while\nremaining in compliance with regulatory\nrequirements. The Board reviews our strategic\nbusiness plan and is ultimately responsible\nfor overseeing and providing direction about\nour strategy and risk appetite. The Board\nreceives regular briefings on firmwide risks,\nincluding liquidity risk, market risk, credit\nrisk, operational risk, model risk and climate\nrisk, from our independent risk oversight and\ncontrol functions, including the chief risk\nofficer, and on compliance risk and conduct\nrisk from Compliance, on legal and regulatory\nenforcement matters from the chief legal\nofficer, and on other matters impacting our\nreputation from the chair and vice-chairs of\nour Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The\nchief risk officer reports to our chief\nexecutive officer and to the Risk Committee of\nthe Board. As part of the review of the\nfirmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk\nofficer regularly advises the Risk Committee\nof the Board of relevant risk metrics and\nmaterial exposures, including risk limits and\nthresholds established in our risk appetite\nstatement.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    130  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nThe implementation of\nour risk governance\nstructure and core\nrisk management\nprocesses is overseen\nby Enterprise Risk,\nwhich reports to our\nchief risk officer,\nand is responsible for\nensuring that our\nenterprise risk\nmanagement framework\nprovides the Board,\nour risk committees\nand senior management\nwith a consistent and\nintegrated approach to\nmanaging our various\nrisks in a manner\nconsistent with our\nrisk appetite.\n\nOur revenue-producing\nunits, as well as\nTreasury, Engineering,\nHuman Capital\nManagement,\nOperations, and\nCorporate and\nWorkplace Solutions,\nare considered our\nfirst line of defense.\nThey are accountable\nfor the outcomes of\nour risk-generating\nactivities, as well as\nfor assessing and\nmanaging those risks\nwithin our risk\nappetite.\n\nOur independent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions are\nconsidered our second\nline of defense and\nprovide independent\nassessment, oversight\nand challenge of the\nrisks taken by our\nfirst line of defense,\nas well as lead and\nparticipate in risk\ncommittees.\nIndependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions include\nCompliance, Conflicts\nResolution,\nControllers, Legal,\nRisk and Tax.\n\nInternal Audit is\nconsidered our third\nline of defense, and\nour director of\nInternal Audit reports\nto the Audit Committee\nof the Board and\nadministratively to\nour chief executive\nofficer. Internal\nAudit includes\nprofessionals with a\nbroad range of audit\nand industry\nexperience, including\nrisk management\nexpertise. Internal\nAudit is responsible\nfor independently\nassessing and\nvalidating the\neffectiveness of key\ncontrols, including\nthose within the risk\nmanagement framework,\nand providing timely\nreporting to the Audit\nCommittee of the\nBoard, senior\nmanagement and\nregulators.\n\nThe three lines of\ndefense structure\npromotes the\naccountability of\nfirst line risk\ntakers, provides a\nframework for\neffective challenge by\nthe second line and\nempowers independent\nreview from the third\nline.\n\nProcesses. We maintain\nvarious processes that\nare critical\ncomponents of our risk\nmanagement framework,\nincluding (i) risk\nidentification and\ncontrol assessment,\n(ii) risk appetite,\nlimit and threshold\nsetting, (iii) risk\nmetrics, reporting and\nmonitoring, and (iv)\nrisk decision-making.\n\n\u2022 Risk Identification\nand Control\nAssessment. We believe\nthe identification of\nour risks and related\ncontrol assessment is\na critical step in\nproviding our Board\nand senior management\ntransparency and\ninsight into the range\nand materiality of our\nrisks. We have a\ncomprehensive data\ncollection process,\nincluding firmwide\npolicies and\nprocedures that\nrequire all employees\nto report and escalate\nrisk events. Our\napproach for risk\nidentification and\ncontrol assessment is\ncomprehensive across\nall risk types, is\ndynamic and forward-\nlooking to reflect and\nadapt to our changing\nrisk profile and\nbusiness environment,\nleverages subject\nmatter expertise, and\nallows for\nprioritization of our\nmost critical risks.\nThis approach also\nencompasses our\ncontrol assessment,\nled by our second line\nof defense, to review\nand challenge the\ncontrol environment to\nensure it supports our\nstrategic business\nplan.\n\nTo effectively assess\nour risks, we maintain\na daily discipline of\nmarking substantially\nall of our inventory\nto current market\nlevels. We carry our\ninventory at fair\nvalue, with changes in\nvaluation reflected\nimmediately in our\nrisk management\nsystems and in net\nrevenues. We do so\nbecause we believe\nthis discipline is one\nof the most effective\ntools for assessing\nand managing risk and\nthat it provides\ntransparent and\nrealistic insight into\nour inventory\nexposures.\n\nAn important part of\nour risk management\nprocess is firmwide\nstress testing. It\nallows us to quantify\nour exposure to tail\nrisks, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations,\nundertake risk/reward\nanalysis, and assess\nand mitigate our risk\npositions. Firmwide\nstress tests are\nperformed on a regular\nbasis and are designed\nto ensure a\ncomprehensive analysis\nof our vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic\nrisks combining\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, credit,\nmarket, liquidity and\nfunding, operational\nand compliance,\nstrategic, systemic\nand emerging risks\ninto a single combined\nscenario. We also\nperform ad hoc stress\ntests in anticipation\nof market events or\nconditions. Stress\ntests are also used to\nassess capital\nadequacy as part of\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess. See \u201cCapital\nManagement and\nRegulatory Capital \u2014\nCapital Management\u201d\nfor further\ninformation.\n\n\u2022 Risk Appetite, Limit\nand Threshold Setting.\nWe apply a rigorous\nframework of limits\nand thresholds to\ncontrol and monitor\nrisk across\ntransactions,\nproducts, businesses\nand markets. The\nBoard, directly or\nindirectly through its\nRisk Committee,\napproves limits and\nthresholds included in\nour risk appetite\nstatement at firmwide,\nbusiness and product\nlevels. In addition,\nthe Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee,\nthrough delegated\nauthority from the\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee, is\nresponsible for\napproving our risk\nlimits and thresholds\npolicy, subject to the\noverall limits\napproved by the Risk\nCommittee of the\nBoard, and monitoring\nthese limits.\n\nThe Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee is\nresponsible for\napproving limits at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels.\nCertain limits may be\nset at levels that\nwill require periodic\nadjustment, rather\nthan at levels that\nreflect our maximum\nrisk appetite. This\nfosters an ongoing\ndialogue about risk\namong our first and\nsecond lines of\ndefense, committees\nand senior management,\nas well as rapid\nescalation of risk-\nrelated matters.\nAdditionally, through\ndelegated authority\nfrom the Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee,\nMarket Risk sets\nlimits at certain\nproduct and desk\nlevels, and Credit\nRisk sets limits for\nindividual\ncounterparties and\ntheir subsidiaries,\nindustries and\ncountries. Limits are\nreviewed regularly and\namended on a permanent\nor temporary basis to\nreflect changes to our\nstrategic business\nplan, as well as\nchanging market\nconditions, business\nconditions or risk\ntolerance.\n                                             \n  131    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \n\u2022 Risk Metrics,\nReporting and\nMonitoring. Effective\nrisk reporting and\nrisk decision-making\ndepends on our ability\nto get the right\ninformation to the\nright people at the\nright time. As such,\nwe focus on the rigor\nand effectiveness of\nour risk systems, with\nthe objective of\nensuring that our risk\nmanagement technology\nsystems provide us\nwith complete,\naccurate and timely\ninformation. Our risk\nmetrics, reporting and\nmonitoring processes\nare designed to take\ninto account\ninformation about both\nexisting and emerging\nrisks, thereby\nenabling our risk\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement to perform\ntheir responsibilities\nwith the appropriate\nlevel of insight into\nrisk exposures.\nFurthermore, our limit\nand threshold breach\nprocesses provide\nmeans for timely\nescalation. We\nevaluate changes in\nour risk profile and\nour businesses,\nincluding changes in\nbusiness mix or\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate, by\nmonitoring risk\nfactors at a firmwide\nlevel.\n\n\u2022 Risk Decision-\nMaking. Our governance\nstructure provides the\nprotocol and\nresponsibility for\ndecision-making on\nrisk management issues\nand ensures\nimplementation of\nthose decisions. We\nmake extensive use of\nrisk committees that\nmeet regularly and\nserve as an important\nmeans to facilitate\nand foster ongoing\ndiscussions to manage\nand mitigate risks.\n\nWe maintain strong and\nproactive\ncommunication about\nrisk and we have a\nculture of\ncollaboration in\ndecision-making among\nour first and second\nlines of defense,\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement. While our\nfirst line of defense\nis responsible for\nmanagement of their\nrisk, we dedicate\nextensive resources to\nour second line of\ndefense in order to\nensure a strong\noversight structure\nand an appropriate\nsegregation of duties.\nWe regularly reinforce\nour strong culture of\nescalation and\naccountability across\nall functions.\n\nPeople. Even the best\ntechnology serves only\nas a tool for helping\nto make informed\ndecisions in real time\nabout the risks we are\ntaking. Ultimately,\neffective risk\nmanagement requires\nour people to\ninterpret our risk\ndata on an ongoing and\ntimely basis and\nadjust risk positions\naccordingly. The\nexperience of our\nprofessionals, and\ntheir understanding of\nthe nuances and\nlimitations of each\nrisk measure, guides\nus in assessing\nexposures and\nmaintaining them\nwithin prudent levels.\n\nWe reinforce a culture\nof effective risk\nmanagement, consistent\nwith our risk\nappetite, in our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nas well as in the way\nwe evaluate\nperformance, and\nrecognize and reward\nour people. Our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nincluding certain\nsessions led by our\nmost senior leaders,\nare focused on the\nimportance of risk\nmanagement, client\nrelationships and\nreputational\nexcellence. As part of\nour performance review\nprocess, we assess\nreputational\nexcellence, including\nhow an employee\nexercises good risk\nmanagement and\nreputational judgment,\nand adheres to our\ncode of conduct and\ncompliance policies.\nOur review and reward\nprocesses are designed\nto communicate and\nreinforce to our\nprofessionals the link\nbetween behavior and\nhow people are\nrecognized, the need\nto focus on our\nclients and our\nreputation, and the\nneed to always act in\naccordance with our\nhighest standards.\n                                              \n  Structure                                   \n                                              \nUltimate oversight of\nrisk is the\nresponsibility of our\nBoard. The Board\noversees risk both\ndirectly and through\nits committees,\nincluding its Risk\nCommittee. We also\nhave a series of\ncommittees with\nspecific risk\nmanagement mandates\nthat have oversight or\ndecision-making\nresponsibilities for\nrisk management\nactivities. Committee\nmembership generally\nconsists of senior\nmanagers from both our\nfirst and second lines\nof defense. We have\nestablished procedures\nfor these committees\nto ensure that\nappropriate\ninformation barriers\nare in place. Our\nprimary risk\ncommittees, most of\nwhich also have\nadditional sub-\ncommittees, councils\nor working groups, are\ndescribed below. In\naddition to these\ncommittees, we have\nother risk committees\nthat provide oversight\nfor different\nbusinesses,\nactivities, products,\nregions and entities.\nAll of our committees\nhave responsibility\nfor considering the\nimpact on our\nreputation of the\ntransactions and\nactivities that they\noversee.\n\nMembership of our risk\ncommittees is reviewed\nregularly and updated\nto reflect changes in\nthe responsibilities\nof the committee\nmembers. Accordingly,\nthe length of time\nthat members serve on\nthe respective\ncommittees varies as\ndetermined by the\ncommittee chairs and\nbased on the\nresponsibilities of\nthe members.\n\nThe chart below\npresents an overview\nof our risk management\ngovernance structure.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    132  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nGCLA. GCLA is\nliquidity that we\nmaintain to meet a\nbroad range of\npotential cash\noutflows and\ncollateral needs in a\nstressed environment.\nA primary liquidity\nprinciple is to pre-\nfund our estimated\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs\nduring a liquidity\ncrisis and hold this\nliquidity in the form\nof unencumbered,\nhighly liquid\nsecurities and cash.\nWe believe that the\nsecurities held in our\nGCLA would be readily\nconvertible to cash in\na matter of days,\nthrough liquidation,\nby entering into\nrepurchase agreements\nor from maturities of\nresale agreements, and\nthat this cash would\nallow us to meet\nimmediate obligations\nwithout needing to\nsell other assets or\ndepend on additional\nfunding from credit-\nsensitive markets.\n\nOur GCLA reflects the\nfollowing principles:\n\n\u2022 The first days or\nweeks of a liquidity\ncrisis are the most\ncritical to a\ncompany\u2019s survival;\n\n\u2022 Focus must be\nmaintained on all\npotential cash and\ncollateral outflows,\nnot just disruptions\nto financing flows.\nOur businesses are\ndiverse, and our\nliquidity needs are\ndetermined by many\nfactors, including\nmarket movements,\ncollateral\nrequirements and\nclient commitments,\nall of which can\nchange dramatically in\na difficult funding\nenvironment;\n\n\u2022 During a liquidity\ncrisis, credit-\nsensitive funding,\nincluding unsecured\ndebt, certain deposits\nand some types of\nsecured financing\nagreements, may be\nunavailable, and the\nterms (e.g., interest\nrates, collateral\nprovisions and tenor)\nor availability of\nother types of secured\nfinancing may change\nand certain deposits\nmay be withdrawn; and\n\n\u2022 As a result of our\npolicy to pre-fund\nliquidity that we\nestimate may be needed\nin a crisis, we hold\nmore unencumbered\nsecurities and have\nlarger funding\nbalances than our\nbusinesses would\notherwise require. We\nbelieve that our\nliquidity is stronger\nwith greater balances\nof highly liquid\nunencumbered\nsecurities, even\nthough it increases\nour total assets and\nour funding costs.\n\nWe maintain our GCLA\nacross Group Inc.,\nGoldman Sachs Funding\nLLC (Funding IHC) and\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries, asset\ntypes and clearing\nagents to provide us\nwith sufficient\noperating liquidity to\nensure timely\nsettlement in all\nmajor markets, even in\na difficult funding\nenvironment. In\naddition to the GCLA,\nwe maintain cash\nbalances and\nsecurities in several\nof our other entities,\nprimarily for use in\nspecific currencies,\nentities or\njurisdictions where we\ndo not have immediate\naccess to parent\ncompany liquidity.\n\nAsset-Liability\nManagement. Our\nliquidity risk\nmanagement policies\nare designed to ensure\nwe have a sufficient\namount of financing,\neven when funding\nmarkets experience\npersistent stress. We\nmanage the maturities\nand diversity of our\nfunding across\nmarkets, products and\ncounterparties, and\nseek to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nOur approach to asset-\nliability management\nincludes:\n\n\u2022 Conservatively\nmanaging the overall\ncharacteristics of our\nfunding book, with a\nfocus on maintaining\nlong-term, diversified\nsources of funding in\nexcess of our current\nrequirements. See\n\u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nFunding Sources\u201d for\nfurther information;\n\n\u2022 Actively managing\nand monitoring our\nasset base, with\nparticular focus on\nthe liquidity, holding\nperiod and ability to\nfund assets on a\nsecured basis. We\nassess our funding\nrequirements and our\nability to liquidate\nassets in a stressed\nenvironment while\nappropriately managing\nrisk. This enables us\nto determine the most\nappropriate funding\nproducts and tenors.\nSee \u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nBalance Sheet\nManagement\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our balance\nsheet management\nprocess and \u201c\u2014 Funding\nSources \u2014 Secured\nFunding\u201d for further\ninformation about\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis; and\n\n\u2022 Raising secured and\nunsecured financing\nthat has a long tenor\nrelative to the\nliquidity profile of\nour assets. This\nreduces the risk that\nour liabilities will\ncome due in advance of\nour ability to\ngenerate liquidity\nfrom the sale of our\nassets. Because we\nmaintain a highly\nliquid balance sheet,\nthe holding period of\ncertain of our assets\nmay be materially\nshorter than their\ncontractual maturity\ndates.\n\nOur goal is to ensure\nthat we maintain\nsufficient liquidity\nto fund our assets and\nmeet our contractual\nand contingent\nobligations in normal\ntimes, as well as\nduring periods of\nmarket stress. Through\nour dynamic balance\nsheet management\nprocess, we use actual\nand projected asset\nbalances to determine\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding requirements.\nFunding plans are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee.\nIn addition, our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions analyze, and\nthe Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee\nreviews, our\nconsolidated total\ncapital position\n(unsecured long-term\nborrowings plus total\nshareholders\u2019 equity)\nso that we maintain a\nlevel of long-term\nfunding that is\nsufficient to meet our\nlong-term financing\nrequirements. In a\nliquidity crisis, we\nwould first use our\nGCLA in order to avoid\nreliance on asset\nsales (other than our\nGCLA). However, we\nrecognize that orderly\nasset sales may be\nprudent or necessary\nin a severe or\npersistent liquidity\ncrisis.\n                                             \n  135    Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In\naddition, Group Inc.\nprovides its regulated\nsubsidiaries with the\nnecessary capital to\nmeet their regulatory\nrequirements. The\nbenefits of this\napproach to subsidiary\nfunding are enhanced\ncontrol and greater\nflexibility to meet\nthe funding\nrequirements of our\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nis also raised at the\nsubsidiary level\nthrough a variety of\nproducts, including\ndeposits, secured\nfunding and unsecured\nborrowings.\n\nOur intercompany\nfunding policies\nassume that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s funds or\nsecurities are not\nfreely available to\nits parent, Funding\nIHC or other\nsubsidiaries unless\n(i) legally provided\nfor and (ii) there are\nno additional\nregulatory, tax or\nother restrictions. In\nparticular, many of\nour subsidiaries are\nsubject to laws that\nauthorize regulatory\nbodies to block or\nreduce the flow of\nfunds from those\nsubsidiaries to Group\nInc. or Funding IHC.\nRegulatory action of\nthat kind could impede\naccess to funds that\nGroup Inc. needs to\nmake payments on its\nobligations.\nAccordingly, we assume\nthat the capital\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or other\nsubsidiaries and any\nother financing\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or Funding\nIHC until the maturity\nof such financing.\n\nGroup Inc. has\nprovided substantial\namounts of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness, directly\nor indirectly, to its\nregulated\nsubsidiaries. For\nexample, as of March\n2023, Group Inc. had\n$37.48 billion of\nequity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness invested\nin GS&Co., its\nprincipal U.S.\nregistered broker-\ndealer; $48.92 billion\ninvested in GSI, a\nregulated U.K. broker-\ndealer; $2.65 billion\ninvested in GSJCL, a\nregulated Japanese\nbroker-dealer; $52.89\nbillion invested in GS\nBank USA, a regulated\nNew York State-\nchartered bank; and\n$4.46 billion invested\nin GSIB, a regulated\nU.K. bank. Group Inc.\nalso provides\nfinancing, directly or\nindirectly, in the\nform of: $126.19\nbillion of\nunsubordinated loans\n(including secured\nloans of $52.11\nbillion) and $31.79\nbillion of collateral\nand cash deposits to\nthese entities as of\nMarch 2023. In\naddition, as of March\n2023, Group Inc. had\nsignificant amounts of\ncapital invested in\nand loans to its other\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nContingency Funding\nPlan. We maintain a\ncontingency funding\nplan to provide a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nliquidity crisis\nsituation or periods\nof market stress. Our\ncontingency funding\nplan outlines a list\nof potential risk\nfactors, key reports\nand metrics that are\nreviewed on an ongoing\nbasis to assist in\nassessing the severity\nof, and managing\nthrough, a liquidity\ncrisis and/or market\ndislocation. The\ncontingency funding\nplan also describes in\ndetail our potential\nresponses if our\nassessments indicate\nthat we have entered a\nliquidity crisis,\nwhich include pre-\nfunding for what we\nestimate will be our\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs, as\nwell as utilizing\nsecondary sources of\nliquidity. Mitigants\nand action items to\naddress specific risks\nwhich may arise are\nalso described and\nassigned to\nindividuals\nresponsible for\nexecution.\n\nThe contingency\nfunding plan\nidentifies key groups\nof individuals and\ntheir\nresponsibilities,\nwhich include\nfostering effective\ncoordination, control\nand distribution of\ninformation,\nimplementing liquidity\nmaintenance activities\nand managing internal\nand external\ncommunication, all of\nwhich are critical in\nthe management of a\ncrisis or period of\nmarket stress.\nStress Tests\nIn order to determine\nthe appropriate size\nof our GCLA, we model\nliquidity outflows\nover a range of\nscenarios and time\nhorizons. One of our\nprimary internal\nliquidity risk models,\nreferred to as the\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow, quantifies\nour liquidity risks\nover a 30-day stress\nscenario. We also\nconsider other\nfactors, including,\nbut not limited to, an\nassessment of our\npotential intraday\nliquidity needs\nthrough an additional\ninternal liquidity\nrisk model, referred\nto as the Intraday\nLiquidity Model, the\nresults of our long-\nterm stress testing\nmodels, our resolution\nliquidity models and\nother applicable\nregulatory\nrequirements and a\nqualitative assessment\nof our condition, as\nwell as the financial\nmarkets. The results\nof the Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow, the\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel, the long-term\nstress testing models\nand the resolution\nliquidity models are\nreported to senior\nmanagement on a\nregular basis. We also\nperform firmwide\nstress tests.

Our Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow is\nbased on conducting\nmultiple scenarios\nthat include\ncombinations of\nmarket-wide and firm-\nspecific stress. These\nscenarios are\ncharacterized by the\nfollowing qualitative\nelements:\n\n\u2022 Severely challenged\nmarket environments,\nwhich include low\nconsumer and corporate\nconfidence, financial\nand political\ninstability, and\nadverse changes in\nmarket values,\nincluding potential\ndeclines in equity\nmarkets and widening\nof credit spreads; and\n\n\u2022 A firm-specific\ncrisis potentially\ntriggered by material\nlosses, reputational\ndamage, litigation\nand/or a ratings\ndowngrade.\n\nThe following are key\nmodeling elements of\nour Modeled Liquidity\nOutflow:\n\n\u2022 Liquidity needs over\na 30-day scenario;\n\n\u2022 A two-notch\ndowngrade of our long-\nterm senior unsecured\ncredit ratings;\n\n\u2022 Changing conditions\nin funding markets,\nwhich limit our access\nto unsecured and\nsecured funding;\n\n\u2022 No support from\nadditional government\nfunding facilities.\nAlthough we have\naccess to various\ncentral bank funding\nprograms, we do not\nassume reliance on\nadditional sources of\nfunding in a liquidity\ncrisis; and\n\n\u2022 A combination of\ncontractual outflows\nand contingent\noutflows arising from\nboth our on- and off-\nbalance sheet\narrangements.\nContractual outflows\ninclude, among other\nthings, upcoming\nmaturities of\nunsecured debt, term\ndeposits and secured\nfunding. Contingent\noutflows include,\namong other things,\nthe withdrawal of\ncustomer credit\nbalances in our prime\nbrokerage business,\nincrease in variation\nmargin requirements\ndue to adverse changes\nin the value of our\nexchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared\nderivatives, draws on\nunfunded commitments\nand withdrawals of\ndeposits that have no\ncontractual maturity.\nSee notes to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\ncontractual outflows,\nincluding Note 11 for\ncollateralized\nfinancings, Note 13\nfor deposits, Note 14\nfor unsecured long-\nterm borrowings and\nNote 15 for operating\nlease payments, and\n\u201cOff-Balance Sheet\nArrangements\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our various\ntypes of off-balance\nsheet arrangements.\n\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel. Our Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nmeasures our intraday\nliquidity needs using\na scenario analysis\ncharacterized by the\nsame qualitative\nelements as our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow. The model\nassesses the risk of\nincreased intraday\nliquidity requirements\nduring a scenario\nwhere access to\nsources of intraday\nliquidity may become\nconstrained.\n\nLong-Term Stress\nTesting. We utilize\nlonger-term stress\ntests to take a\nforward view on our\nliquidity position\nthrough prolonged\nstress periods in\nwhich we experience a\nsevere liquidity\nstress and recover in\nan environment that\ncontinues to be\nchallenging. We are\nfocused on ensuring\nconservative asset-\nliability management\nto prepare for a\nprolonged period of\npotential stress,\nseeking to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nResolution Liquidity\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established our\nResolution Liquidity\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich estimates\nliquidity needs of our\nmajor subsidiaries in\na stressed\nenvironment. The\nliquidity needs are\nmeasured using our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow assumptions\nand include certain\nadditional inter-\naffiliate exposures.\nWe have also\nestablished our\nResolution Liquidity\nExecution Need\nframework, which\nmeasures the liquidity\nneeds of our major\nsubsidiaries to\nstabilize and wind\ndown following a Group\nInc. bankruptcy filing\nin accordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIn addition, we have\nestablished a triggers\nand alerts framework,\nwhich is designed to\nprovide the Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc.\n                                              \n  Limits                                      \n                                              \nWe use liquidity risk\nlimits at various\nlevels and across\nliquidity risk types\nto manage the size of\nour liquidity\nexposures. Limits are\nmeasured relative to\nacceptable levels of\nrisk given our\nliquidity risk\ntolerance. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess.\n\nLimits are monitored\nby Treasury and\nLiquidity Risk.\nLiquidity Risk is\nresponsible for\nidentifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded.\n                                              \n  GCLA and Unencumbered Metrics               \n                                              \nGCLA.

We\nmaintain our GCLA to\nenable us to meet\ncurrent and potential\nliquidity requirements\nof our parent company,\nGroup Inc., and its\nsubsidiaries. Our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow and Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nincorporate a\nrequirement for Group\nInc., as well as a\nstandalone requirement\nfor each of our major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nIHC is required to\nprovide the necessary\nliquidity to Group\nInc. during the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, and is also\nobligated to provide\ncapital and liquidity\nsupport to major\nsubsidiaries in the\nevent of our material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure. Liquidity\nheld directly in each\nof our major broker-\ndealer and bank\nsubsidiaries is\nintended for use only\nby that subsidiary to\nmeet its liquidity\nrequirements and is\nassumed not to be\navailable to Group\nInc. or Funding IHC\nunless (i) legally\nprovided for and (ii)\nthere are no\nadditional regulatory,\ntax or other\nrestrictions. In\naddition, the Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow and\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel also incorporate\na broader assessment\nof standalone\nliquidity requirements\nfor other subsidiaries\nand we hold a portion\nof our GCLA directly\nat Group Inc. or\nFunding IHC to support\nsuch requirements.\n\nOther Unencumbered\nAssets. In addition to\nour GCLA, we have a\nsignificant amount of\nother unencumbered\ncash and financial\ninstruments, including\nother government\nobligations, high-\ngrade money market\nsecurities, corporate\nobligations,\nmarginable equities,\nloans and cash\ndeposits not included\nin our GCLA. The fair\nvalue of our\nunencumbered assets\naveraged $285.88\nbillion for the three\nmonths ended March\n2023 and $273.49\nbillion for the three\nmonths ended December\n2022. We do not\nconsider these assets\nliquid enough to be\neligible for our GCLA.\nLiquidity Regulatory\nFramework As a BHC, we\nare subject to a\nminimum Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR)\nunder the LCR rule\napproved by the U.S.\nfederal bank\nregulatory agencies.\nThe LCR rule requires\norganizations to\nmaintain an adequate\nratio of eligible\nhigh-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) to\nexpected net cash\noutflows under an\nacute, short-term\nliquidity stress\nscenario. Eligible\nHQLA excludes HQLA\nheld by subsidiaries\nthat is in excess of\ntheir minimum\nrequirement and is\nsubject to transfer\nrestrictions. We are\nrequired to maintain a\nminimum LCR of 100%.\nWe expect that\nfluctuations in client\nactivity, business mix\nand the market\nenvironment will\nimpact our LCR.

Certain of our derivatives have\nbeen transacted under bilateral agreements\nwith counterparties who may require us to post\ncollateral or terminate the transactions based\non changes in our credit ratings. We manage\nour GCLA to ensure we would, among other\npotential requirements, be able to make the\nadditional collateral or termination payments\nthat may be required in the event of a two-\nnotch reduction in our long-term credit\nratings, as well as collateral that has not\nbeen called by counterparties, but is\navailable to them.\n\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial\nstatements for further information about\nderivatives with credit-related contingent\nfeatures and the additional collateral or\ntermination payments related to our net\nderivative liabilities under bilateral\nagreements that could have been called by\ncounterparties in the event of a one- or two-\nnotch downgrade in our credit ratings. Cash\nFlows As a global financial institution, our\ncash flows are complex and bear little\nrelation to our net earnings and net assets.\nConsequently, we believe that traditional cash\nflow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating\nour liquidity position than the liquidity and\nasset-liability management policies described\nabove. Cash flow analysis may, however, be\nhelpful in highlighting certain macro trends\nand strategic initiatives in our businesses.\nThree Months Ended March 2023. Our cash and\ncash equivalents decreased by $12.50 billion\nto $229.33 billion at the end of the first\nquarter of 2023, primarily due to net cash\nused for financing activities, partially\noffset by net cash provided by operating\nactivities. The net cash used for financing\nactivities primarily reflected cash outflows\nfrom net repayments of unsecured long-term\nborrowings and deposits (reflecting decreases\nin private bank and consumer deposits, deposit\nsweep program balances and brokered\ncertificates of deposit). The net cash\nprovided by operating activities primarily\nreflected cash inflows from collateralized\ntransactions (reflecting both an increase in\ncollateralized financings and a decrease in\ncollateralized agreements), partially offset\nby an increase in trading assets. Three Months\nEnded March 2022 . Our cash and cash\nequivalents increased by $13.13 billion to\n$274.16 billion at the end of the first\nquarter of 2022, due to net cash provided by\nfinancing activities, partially offset by net\ncash used for operating activities and\ninvesting activities and the effect of\nexchange rate changes on cash and cash\nequivalents. The net cash provided by\nfinancing activities primarily reflected an\nincrease in net deposits, reflecting increases\nacross channels, and net issuance of unsecured\nlong-term borrowings. The net cash used for\noperating activities primarily reflected\nincreases in collateralized transactions (an\nincrease in collateralized agreements and a\ndecrease in collateralized financings) and\ntrading assets, partially offset by an\nincrease in trading liabilities and a decrease\nin customer and other receivables and\npayables, net (an increase in customer and\nother payables, partially offset by an\nincrease in customer and other receivables).\nThe net cash used for investing activities\nprimarily reflected an increase in net lending\nactivities and purchases of investments,\npartially offset by sales and paydowns of\ninvestments. The decrease in cash and cash\nequivalents as a result of changes in foreign\nexchange rates was due to the U.S. dollar\nstrengthening during the quarter.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    140  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Inherent\nlimitations to VaR\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 VaR does not\nestimate potential\nlosses over longer\ntime horizons where\nmoves may be extreme;\n\n\u2022 VaR does not take\naccount of the\nrelative liquidity of\ndifferent risk\npositions; and\n\n\u2022 Previous moves in\nmarket risk factors\nmay not produce\naccurate predictions\nof all future market\nmoves.\n\nTo comprehensively\ncapture our exposures\nand relevant risks in\nour VaR calculation,\nwe use historical\nsimulations with full\nvaluation of market\nfactors at the\nposition level by\nsimultaneously\nshocking the relevant\nmarket factors for\nthat position. These\nmarket factors include\nspot prices, credit\nspreads, funding\nspreads, yield curves,\nvolatility and\ncorrelation, and are\nupdated periodically\nbased on changes in\nthe composition of\npositions, as well as\nvariations in market\nconditions. We sample\nfrom five years of\nhistorical data to\ngenerate the scenarios\nfor our VaR\ncalculation. The\nhistorical data is\nweighted so that the\nrelative importance of\nthe data reduces over\ntime. This gives\ngreater importance to\nmore recent\nobservations and\nreflects current asset\nvolatilities, which\nimproves the accuracy\nof our estimates of\npotential loss. As a\nresult, even if our\npositions included in\nVaR were unchanged,\nour VaR would increase\nwith increasing market\nvolatility and vice\nversa.\n\nGiven its reliance on\nhistorical data, VaR\nis most effective in\nestimating risk\nexposures in markets\nin which there are no\nsudden fundamental\nchanges or shifts in\nmarket conditions.\n\nOur VaR measure does\nnot include:\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nnot accounted for at\nfair value, such as\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities and loans,\ndeposits and unsecured\nborrowings that are\naccounted for at\namortized cost;\n\n\u2022 Available-for-sale\nsecurities for which\nthe related unrealized\nfair value gains and\nlosses are included in\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss);\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nbest measured and\nmonitored using\nsensitivity measures;\nand\n\n\u2022 The impact of\nchanges in\ncounterparty and our\nown credit spreads on\nderivatives, as well\nas changes in our own\ncredit spreads on\nfinancial liabilities\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected.\n\nWe perform daily\nbacktesting of our VaR\nmodel (i.e., comparing\ndaily net revenues for\npositions included in\nVaR to the VaR measure\ncalculated as of the\nprior business day) at\nthe firmwide level and\nfor each of our\nbusinesses and major\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nEarnings-at-Risk. We\nmanage our interest\nrate risk using the\nEaR metric. EaR\nmeasures the estimated\nimpact of changes in\ninterest rates to our\nnet revenues and\npreferred stock\ndividends over a\ndefined time horizon.\nEaR complements the\nVaR metric, which\nmeasures the impact of\ninterest rate changes\nthat have an immediate\nimpact on the fair\nvalues of our assets\nand liabilities (i.e.,\nmark-to-market\nchanges). Our exposure\nto interest rate risk\noccurs due to a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to:\n\n\u2022 Differences in\nmaturity or repricing\ndates of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock and certain off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments.\n\n\u2022 Differences in the\namounts of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock and certain off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments with the\nsame maturity or\nrepricing dates.\n\n\u2022 Certain interest\nrate sensitive fees.\n\nTreasury manages the\naggregated interest\nrate risk from all\nbusinesses through our\ninvestment securities\nportfolio and interest\nrate derivatives. We\nmeasure EaR over a\none-year time horizon\nfollowing a 100-basis\npoint instantaneous\nparallel shock in both\nshort- and long-term\ninterest rates. This\nsensitivity is\ncalculated relative to\na baseline market\nscenario, which takes\ninto consideration,\namong other things,\nthe market\u2019s\nexpectation of forward\nrates, as well as our\nexpectation of future\nbusiness activity.\nThis scenario includes\ncontractual elements\nof assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock, and certain\noff-balance sheet\ninstruments, such as\nrates of interest,\nprincipal repayment\nschedules, maturity\nand reset dates, and\nany interest rate\nceilings or floors, as\nwell as assumptions\nwith respect to our\nbalance sheet size and\ncomposition, deposit\nrepricing and\nprepayment behavior.\nWe manage EaR with a\ngoal to reduce\npotential volatility\nresulting from changes\nin interest rates so\nit remains within our\nEaR risk appetite. Our\nEaR scenario is\nregularly evaluated\nand updated, if\nnecessary, to reflect\nchanges in our\nbusiness plans, market\nconditions and other\nmacroeconomic factors.\nWhile management uses\nthe best information\navailable to estimate\nEaR, actual results\nmay differ materially\nas a result of, among\nother things, changes\nin the economic\nenvironment or\nassumptions used in\nthe process.\n\nRisk, which is\nindependent of our\nrevenue-producing\nunits, and Treasury,\nhave primary\nresponsibility for\nassessing and\nmonitoring EaR through\nfirmwide oversight,\nincluding oversight of\nEaR stress testing and\nassumptions, and the\nestablishment of our\nEaR risk appetite.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    142  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Stress\ntesting is a method of\ndetermining the effect\nof various\nhypothetical stress\nscenarios. In addition\nto EaR, we use other\nstress tests to\nexamine risks of\nspecific portfolios,\nas well as the\npotential impact of\nour significant risk\nexposures. We use a\nvariety of stress\ntesting techniques to\ncalculate the\npotential loss from a\nwide range of market\nmoves on our\nportfolios, including\nfirmwide stress tests,\nsensitivity analysis\nand scenario analysis.\nThe results of our\nvarious stress tests\nare analyzed together\nfor risk management\npurposes. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\nSensitivity analysis\nis used to quantify\nthe impact of a market\nmove in a single risk\nfactor across all\npositions (e.g.,\nequity prices or\ncredit spreads) using\na variety of defined\nmarket shocks, ranging\nfrom those that could\nbe expected over a\none-day time horizon\nup to those that could\ntake many months to\noccur. We also use\nsensitivity analysis\nto quantify the impact\nof the default of any\nsingle entity, which\ncaptures the risk of\nlarge or concentrated\nexposures. Scenario\nanalysis is used to\nquantify the impact of\na specified event,\nincluding how the\nevent impacts multiple\nrisk factors\nsimultaneously. For\nexample, for sovereign\nstress testing we\ncalculate potential\ndirect exposure\nassociated with our\nsovereign positions,\nas well as the\ncorresponding debt,\nequity and currency\nexposures associated\nwith our non-sovereign\npositions that may be\nimpacted by the\nsovereign distress.\nWhen conducting\nscenario analysis, we\noften consider a\nnumber of possible\noutcomes for each\nscenario, ranging from\nmoderate to severely\nadverse market\nimpacts. In addition,\nthese stress tests are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical events and\nforward-looking\nhypothetical\nscenarios. Unlike VaR\nmeasures, which have\nan implied probability\nbecause they are\ncalculated at a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, there may not\nbe an implied\nprobability that our\nstress testing\nscenarios will occur.\nInstead, stress\ntesting is used to\nmodel both moderate\nand more extreme moves\nin underlying market\nfactors. When\nestimating potential\nloss, we generally\nassume that our\npositions cannot be\nreduced or hedged\n(although experience\ndemonstrates that we\nare generally able to\ndo so). Limits We use\nmarket risk limits at\nvarious levels to\nmanage the size of our\nmarket exposures.\nThese limits are set\nbased on VaR, EaR and\non a range of stress\ntests relevant to our\nexposures. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess.\n\nLimits are monitored\nby Treasury and Risk.\nRisk is responsible\nfor identifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded (e.g., due to\npositional changes or\nchanges in market\nconditions, such as\nincreased volatilities\nor changes in\ncorrelations). Such\ninstances are\nremediated by a\nreduction in the\npositions we hold\nand/or a temporary or\npermanent increase to\nthe limit, if\nwarranted. Metrics We\nanalyze VaR at the\nfirmwide level and a\nvariety of more\ndetailed levels,\nincluding by risk\ncategory, business and\nregion.\nDiversification effect\nin the tables below\nrepresents the\ndifference between\ntotal VaR and the sum\nof the VaRs for the\nfour risk categories.\nThis effect arises\nbecause the four\nmarket risk categories\nare not perfectly\ncorrelated. During the\nfirst quarter of 2023,\nwe added the currency\nexposure on certain\ndebt and equity\npositions to VaR and\nremoved certain debt\nand equity positions\n(and related hedges)\nfrom VaR as our\nmanagement believes\nthat the risk of these\npositions is more\nappropriately measured\nand monitored using\n10% sensitivity\nmeasures.

Credit Risk Management Overview Credit\nrisk represents the potential for loss due to\nthe default or deterioration in credit quality\nof a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives\ncounterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of\nsecurities or other instruments we hold. Our\nexposure to credit risk comes mostly from\nclient transactions in OTC derivatives and\nloans and lending commitments. Credit risk\nalso comes from cash placed with banks,\nsecurities financing transactions (i.e.,\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending activities)\nand customer and other receivables.\n\nCredit Risk, which is independent of our\nrevenue-producing units and reports to our\nchief risk officer, has primary responsibility\nfor assessing, monitoring and managing our\ncredit risk through firmwide oversight across\nour global businesses. In addition, we hold\nother positions that give rise to credit risk\n(e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These\ncredit risks are captured as a component of\nmarket risk measures, which are monitored and\nmanaged by Market Risk. We also enter into\nderivatives to manage market risk exposures.\nSuch derivatives also give rise to credit\nrisk, which is monitored and managed by Credit\nRisk. Credit Risk Management Process Our\nprocess for managing credit risk includes the\ncritical components of our risk management\nframework described in the \u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk Management,\u201d as well as the\nfollowing: \u2022 Monitoring compliance with\nestablished credit risk limits and reporting\nour credit exposures and credit\nconcentrations; \u2022 Establishing or approving\nunderwriting standards; \u2022 Assessing the\nlikelihood that a counterparty will default on\nits payment obligations; \u2022 Measuring our\ncurrent and potential credit exposure and\nlosses resulting from a counterparty default;\n\u2022 Using credit risk mitigants, including\ncollateral and hedging; and \u2022 Maximizing\nrecovery through active workout and\nrestructuring of claims. We also perform\ncredit analyses, which incorporate initial and\nongoing evaluations of the capacity and\nwillingness of a counterparty to meet its\nfinancial obligations. For substantially all\nof our credit exposures, the core of our\nprocess is an annual counterparty credit\nevaluation or more frequently if deemed\nnecessary as a result of events or changes in\ncircumstances. We determine an internal credit\nrating for the counterparty by considering the\nresults of the credit evaluations and\nassumptions with respect to the nature of and\noutlook for the counterparty\u2019s industry and\nthe economic environment. Beginning in the\nfirst quarter of 2023, we also take into\nconsideration collateral received or other\ncredit support arrangements when determining\nan internal credit rating for collateralized\nloans, as management believes that this\nmethodology better reflects the credit quality\nof the underlying loans and lending\ncommitments. Prior period amounts have been\nconformed to reflect the current methodology.\nSenior personnel, with expertise in specific\nindustries, inspect and approve credit reviews\nand internal credit ratings. Our risk\nassessment process may also include, where\napplicable, reviewing certain key metrics,\nincluding, but not limited to, delinquency\nstatus, collateral value, FICO credit scores\nand other risk factors.\n                                             \n  Goldman Sachs March 2023 Form 10-Q    146  \n                                             \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These shocks\ncover a wide range of\nmoderate and more\nextreme market\nmovements, including\nshocks to multiple\nrisk factors,\nconsistent with the\noccurrence of a severe\nmarket or economic\nevent. In the case of\nsovereign default, we\nestimate the direct\nimpact of the default\non our sovereign\ncredit exposures,\nchanges to our credit\nexposures arising from\npotential market moves\nin response to the\ndefault, and the\nimpact of credit\nmarket deterioration\non corporate borrowers\nand counterparties\nthat may result from\nthe sovereign default.\nUnlike potential\nexposure, which is\ncalculated within a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, stress testing\ndoes not generally\nassume a probability\nof these events\noccurring.

OTC Derivatives.\nOur credit exposure on\nOTC derivatives arises\nprimarily from our\nmarket-making\nactivities. As a\nmarket maker, we enter\ninto derivative\ntransactions to\nprovide liquidity to\nclients and to\nfacilitate the\ntransfer and hedging\nof their risks. We\nalso enter into\nderivatives to manage\nmarket risk exposures.\nWe manage our credit\nexposure on OTC\nderivatives using the\ncredit risk process,\nmeasures, limits and\nrisk mitigants\ndescribed above.\n\nWe generally enter\ninto OTC derivatives\ntransactions under\nbilateral collateral\narrangements that\nrequire the daily\nexchange of\ncollateral. As credit\nrisk is an essential\ncomponent of fair\nvalue, we include a\ncredit valuation\nadjustment (CVA) in\nthe fair value of\nderivatives to reflect\ncounterparty credit\nrisk, as described in\nNote 7 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. CVA is a\nfunction of the\npresent value of\nexpected exposure, the\nprobability of\ncounterparty default\nand the assumed\nrecovery upon default.\nThe table below\npresents our net\ncredit exposure from\nOTC derivatives and\nthe concentration by\nindustry and region.\n                                              \n               As of                          \n                      March    Decemb\u2026        \n  $ in                 2023             2022  \n  millio\u2026                                     \n  OTC                                         \n  deriva\u2026    $43,562           $53,399        \n  assets                                      \n  Collat\u2026                                     \n  (not                                        \n  netted     -14,582           -15,823        \n  under                                       \n  U.S.                                        \n  GAAP)                                       \n  Net                                         \n  credit     $28,980           $37,576        \n  exposu\u2026                                     \n  Indust\u2026                                     \n  Consum\u2026                                     \n  &                4      %          3     %  \n  Retail                                      \n  Divers\u2026         11      %          8     %  \n  Indust\u2026                                     \n  Financ\u2026         20      %         20     %  \n  Instit\u2026                                     \n  Funds           18      %         19     %  \n  Health\u2026          1      %          1     %  \n  Munici\u2026                                     \n  &                4      %          2     %  \n  Nonpro\u2026                                     \n  Natural                                     \n  Resour\u2026         26      %         34     %  \n  &                                           \n  Utilit\u2026                                     \n  Sovere\u2026          9      %          7     %  \n  Techno\u2026                                     \n  Media &          5      %          4     %  \n  Teleco\u2026                                     \n  Other                                       \n  (inclu\u2026                                     \n  Special          2      %          2     %  \n  Purpose                                     \n  Vehicl\u2026                                     \n  Total          100      %        100     %  \n  Region                                      \n  Americ\u2026         48      %         49     %  \n  EMEA            43      %         43     %  \n  Asia             9      %          8     %  \n  Total          100      %        100     %  \n                                              \nOur credit exposure\n(before any potential\nrecoveries) to OTC\nderivative\ncounterparties that\ndefaulted during the\nthree months ended\nMarch 2023 remained\nlow, representing less\nthan 2% of our total\ncredit exposure from\nOTC derivatives.

In\naddition, we also have\ncredit exposure to\nother loans held for\nsecuritization of\n$1.61 billion as of\nMarch 2023 and $1.76\nbillion as of December\n2022. Such loans are\nincluded in trading\nassets in our\nconsolidated balance\nsheets. Credit Hedges.\nTo mitigate the credit\nrisk associated with\nour lending\nactivities, we obtain\ncredit protection on\ncertain loans and\nlending commitments\nthrough credit default\nswaps, both single-\nname and index-based\ncontracts, and through\nthe issuance of\ncredit-linked notes.\n\nSecurities Financing\nTransactions. We enter\ninto securities\nfinancing transactions\nin order to, among\nother things,\nfacilitate client\nactivities, invest\nexcess cash, acquire\nsecurities to cover\nshort positions and\nfinance certain\nactivities. We bear\ncredit risk related to\nresale agreements and\nsecurities borrowed\nonly to the extent\nthat cash advanced or\nthe value of\nsecurities pledged or\ndelivered to the\ncounterparty exceeds\nthe value of the\ncollateral received.\nWe also have credit\nexposure on repurchase\nagreements and\nsecurities loaned to\nthe extent that the\nvalue of securities\npledged or delivered\nto the counterparty\nfor these transactions\nexceeds the amount of\ncash or collateral\nreceived. Securities\ncollateral for these\ntransactions primarily\nincludes U.S. and\nnon-U.S. government\nand agency\nobligations.

These\nreceivables generally\nhave minimal credit\nrisk due to the low\nprobability of\nclearing organization\ndefault and the short-\nterm nature of\nreceivables related to\nsecurities\nsettlements.\nReceivables from\ncustomers and\ncounterparties\ngenerally consist of\ncollateralized\nreceivables related to\ncustomer securities\ntransactions and\ngenerally have minimal\ncredit risk due to\nboth the value of the\ncollateral received\nand the short-term\nnature of these\nreceivables.

Credit exposure represents\nthe potential for loss due to the default or\ndeterioration in credit quality of a\ncounterparty or borrower. Market exposure\nrepresents the potential for loss in value of\nour long and short positions due to changes in\nmarket prices.\n\nCountry Exposures. The Russian invasion of\nUkraine has negatively affected the global\neconomy and resulted in significant\ndisruptions in financial markets and increased\nmacroeconomic uncertainty. The extent and\nduration of the war, sanctions and resulting\nmarket disruptions, as well as the potential\nadverse consequences for our business,\nliquidity and results of operations, are\ndifficult to predict. Our senior management,\nrisk committees and the Board receive regular\nbriefings from our independent risk oversight\nand control functions, including our chief\nrisk officer, on Russian and Ukrainian\nexposures, as well as other relevant risk\nmetrics. We have significantly reduced our\nexposure to Russia and Ukraine and have\ncurtailed our operations in Russia to those\nnecessary to meet our legal and regulatory\nobligations. The overall direct financial\nimpact to our net revenues for the first\nquarter of 2023 from Russian and Ukrainian\ncounterparties, borrowers, issuers and related\ninstruments was not material. We have\nestablished a firmwide working group to\nidentify and assess the operational risk\nassociated with complying with economic\nsanctions and restrictions as a result of this\ninvasion. In addition, to mitigate the risk of\nincreased cyber attacks, we liaise with\ngovernment agencies in order to update our\nmonitoring processes with the latest\ninformation. Our total credit exposure to\nRussian or Ukrainian counterparties or\nborrowers and our total market exposure\nrelating to Russian or Ukrainian issuers was\nnot material as of March 2023. See \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form\n10-K for further information about our risks\nrelated to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In\naddition, economic and/or political\nuncertainties in Argentina, Ethiopia, Ghana,\nLebanon, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Venezuela\nhave led to concerns about their financial\nstability. Our credit exposure to\ncounterparties or borrowers and our market\nexposure to issuers relating to each of these\ncountries was not material as of March 2023.\nWe have a comprehensive framework to monitor,\nmeasure and assess our country exposures and\nto determine our risk appetite. We determine\nthe country of risk by the location of the\ncounterparty, issuer\u2019s assets, where they\ngenerate revenue, the country in which they\nare headquartered, the jurisdiction where a\nclaim against them could be enforced, and/or\nthe government whose policies affect their\nability to repay their obligations.
