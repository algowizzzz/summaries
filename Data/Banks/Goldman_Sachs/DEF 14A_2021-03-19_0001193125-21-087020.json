When I wrote to you in March\n2020, we had only begun to scratch the surface\nof the multifaceted challenges and\ncomplexities that 2020 would bring, from the\nunprecedented public health crisis and the\ndevastating economic impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic, to the focus on racial equity and\ninjustice in the U.S. and other countries\naround the world, among many others. Goldman\nSachs navigated this unprecedented operating\nenvironment very well, as David Solomon,\njoined by the senior leaders and all the\npeople of Goldman Sachs, responded\nproactively, drawing upon the firm\u0092s Core\nValues and culture to prioritize the health\nand safety of our people and deliver\nunparalleled service to clients and customers.\nThe firm also continued to emphasize its long-\nstanding priority of making investments in our\ncommunities, from ongoing support of its\n10,000 Small Businessesinitiatives, including\nthe commitment in response to the COVID-19\npandemic of up to $1.25 billion in emergency\nlending capital to Community Development\nFinancial Institutions and other mission-\ndriven lenders, and the establishment of a\nCOVID-19 Relief Fund that contributed over $40\nmillion to support relief efforts around the\nworld, to the creation of a $10 million Fund\nfor Racial Equity, which builds upon the\nfirm\u0092s practice of making grants in minority\ncommunities and to minority-owned businesses\nover the past two decades. Each of these\nactions allowed the firm to deliver strong\nperformance in 2020 and early success in\nexecuting on the firm\u0092s long-term growth\nstrategy. In times of challenge and change,\nour role as a Board in providing independent\nguidance and oversight to management and the\nfirm is more critical than ever as we seek to\nfulfill our fundamental role as stewards of\nshareholder interest, working to bring long-\nterm value to our shareholders and serve the\ninterests of our other stakeholders. As you\nwould expect, our Board was highly engaged\nwith senior management as the firm navigated\nthe COVID-19 environment, on such issues as\nhow to best support our people and deliver the\nfirm for our clients and other stakeholders\nwhile managing our risks and protecting the\nsafety and soundness of our firm. Providing\noversight of management\u0092s development and\nexecution of its strategic plans is core to\nour Board\u0092s duties, and throughout the year we\nengaged with David, John Waldron and Stephen\nScherr and other key leaders across the firm\non our businesses and strategy. The importance\nof the strategy that senior management laid\nout at last year\u0092s Investor Day to enhance and\nbuild the durability of the firm\u0092s returns has\nbeen reinforced by the events of the past\nyear, and the Board and management continue\nour focus on sound risk management in the\nexecution of our strategic plan. Management\nalso continued its commitment to make the\nnecessary investments, not only in our\nbusinesses and technology, but in the firm\u0092s\npeople. During 2020 we engaged with management\non the importance of the firm\u0092s people\nstrategy, including our continued progress on\ndiversity and inclusion, as well as the firm\u0092s\nlarger goals around attracting talent,\nsupporting our people, sustaining our culture\nand broadening our impact. Sustainability is\ncentral to our long-term success \u0097 it is top\nof mind for you, our shareholders, as well as\nfor our people, our clients and our\ncommunities. To this end, our Board continues\nto focus on firm\u0092s sustainable finance\ncommitments to advance climate transition and\ninclusive growth, which is integrated across\nthe work of our Board and its Committees. In\ncarrying out our work, our Board met actively\nthroughout 2020, with 74 Board and committee\nmeetings, and for me, as Lead Director, over\n100 additional meetings, calls and engagements\nwith the firm and its people, our\nshareholders, regulators and other\nstakeholders, including meetings with\nshareholders representing over 25% of our\nshares outstanding.\n                                              \n  PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT\u00a0FOR\u00a0THE\u00a02021\u00a0ANNUAL\u00a0        \n  MEETING\u00a0OF\u00a0SHAREHOLDERS\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0GOLDMAN         \n  SACHS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0iii                            \n                                              \nLETTER FROM OUR LEAD DIRECTOR As a Board, we\nalso continue to focus on enhancing our own\ndiversity of perspectives and backgrounds. Our\nBoard is pleased to nominate for election\nJessica Uhl, CFO of Royal Dutch Shell plc. If\nelected at our Annual Meeting, Jessica will\njoin our Board and its Audit, Risk and\nGovernance Committees in July 2021. As further\ndetailed in this Proxy Statement, we nominated\nJessica because we believe she will bring\nimportant experience to our Board, from\nfinancial management and complex risk\nmanagement to leadership, operations and\nsustainability, and will further enhance the\nbench strength of our Audit and Risk\nCommittees. We look forward to Jessica\u0092s\ncontributions to our Board. I also want to\naddress the 1Malaysia Development Berhad\n(1MDB) matter. As you are aware, during 2020,\nthe firm resolved government and regulatory\nmatters relating to 1MDB, which allows us to\nput the uncertainty of these investigations\nbehind us and concentrate on self-reflection\nand lessons learned. As a Board, we have been\nfocused on these matters for many years, both\nwith respect to oversight of the progress of\nthese investigations as well as oversight of\nthe myriad of compliance and control\nimprovements that have been made at the firm\nsince the time of the 1MDB transactions that\nenhance the firm\u0092s focus on putting\nreputational risk at the center of its\ndecision-making. As we said in our October\n2020 statement, we as a Board view the 1MDB\nmatter as an institutional failure,\ninconsistent with the high expectations we\nhave for the firm. We will continue to be\nfocused on ensuring the proper controls and\noversight are in place. We appreciate\nmanagement\u0092s commitment to be self-critical\nand we will continue to hold them accountable\nfor doing so, including through our 1MDB\nRemediation Special Committee, which will\nprovide added oversight to the remediation\nefforts arising out of the lessons of 1MDB,\nincluding an emphasis on business ethics.\nImportantly, while none of the past or current\nmembers of senior management were involved in\nor aware of the firm\u0092s participation in any\nillicit activity at the time the firm arranged\nthe 1MDB bond transactions, our Board\ndetermined that it is appropriate in light of\nthe findings of the government and regulatory\ninvestigations and the magnitude of the total\n1MDB settlement that compensation for certain\npast and current members of senior management\nbe impacted. To this end, as previously\nannounced and as you will see described\nfurther in this Proxy Statement, we reduced\nthe 2020 compensation that would otherwise\nhave been paid to the Executive Leadership\nTeam. On behalf of our Board, I want to thank\nyou for your ongoing support of both our Board\nand the firm. We know that this year has\nbrought a multitude of challenges for our\nshareholders, clients and other stakeholders.\nWe value your investment and our ongoing\nengagement, which is invaluable to me and\ninforms the work of our entire Board. Stay\nsafe and healthy, and I look forward to\ncontinuing our dialogue in the year to come.\nAdebayo O.

The review considered a\nvariety of factors, including our governance\npractices and shareholder feedback on our\nBoard and its leadership structure. In\naddition, our Governance Committee considered\nfeedback on the Chairman of the Board received\nin connection with the Board evaluation. As a\nresult of this review, our Governance\nCommittee determined that continuing to have\nMr. Solomon serve as both Chairman and CEO \u0097\nworking together with a strong independent\nLead Director \u0097 is the most effective\nleadership structure for our Board and our\nfirm at this time. Ultimately, we believe that\nour current leadership structure, together\nwith strong governance practices, creates a\nproductive relationship between our Board and\nmanagement, including strong independent\noversight that benefits our shareholders. We\nwill continue to conduct Board leadership\nassessments annually. If at any time our\nGovernance Committee determines it would be\nappropriate to appoint an independent\nChairman, it will not hesitate to do so.\n                               \n  BENEFITS OF A COMBINED ROLE  \n                               \n                                              \n       A combined Chairman-CEO structure      \n       provides our firm with a senior        \n       leader who serves                      \n       as a primary liaison between our       \n  \u220e    Board and management, and as a         \n       primary public face of our firm.

The Committee carries out this\nfunction through an ongoing, year-round\nprocess, which includes the Committee\u0092s annual\nevaluation of our Board and individual\ndirector evaluations. Each director and\ndirector candidate is evaluated by our\nGovernance Committee based on his or her\nindividual merits, taking into account our\nfirm\u0092s needs and the composition of our Board.\nTo assist in this evaluation, the Committee\nutilizes as a discussion tool a matrix of\ncertain skills and experiences that would be\nbeneficial to have represented on our Board\nand on our Committees at any particular point\nin time. For example, the Committee is focused\non what skills are beneficial for service in\nkey Board positions, such as Lead Director and\nCommittee Chairs, and conducts a succession\nplanning process for those positions. Our\nGovernance Committee welcomes candidates\nrecommended by shareholders and will consider\nthese candidates in the same manner as other\ncandidates.

For example, new directors\ntypically meet with senior leaders covering\neach of our revenue-producing divisions and\nregions, as well as with senior leaders from\nkey control-side functions. New directors will\nalso undergo in-depthtraining on the work of\neach of our Board\u0092s Committees, such as Audit\nand Risk Committee orientation sessions with\nour CFO, Controller, Treasurer and CRO, as\nwell as a session with the Director of\nInternal Audit.

Committee        \n  directed a detailed analysis of the Peers   \n  utilized for PSUs.                          \n  \u00bb\u2009\u2009This analysis was conducted by the firm  \n  together with the Compensation              \n  Committee\u0092s independent compensation         \n  consultant, and involved an assessment of   \n  criteria including business mix and         \n  overlap, the firm\u0092s own strategic            \n  initiatives, comparability of capital       \n  requirements, U.S. Global Systemically      \n  Important                                   \n  Banks (G-SIB) status, global footprint,     \n  competition for talent and peer group       \n  benchmarking.                               \n  \u220e\u2009\u2009This analysis confirmed that our         \n  existing Core U.S. Peers and our European   \n  Peers continued to be appropriate in light  \n  of the factors considered.                  \n  \u00bb\u2009\u2009In particular, the Compensation          \n  Committee determined it was appropriate to  \n  retain the existing European firms in our   \n  Peers given their strong correlation with   \n  the firm across the criteria listed above,  \n  including business mix and overlap.         \n  \u220e\u2009\u2009Further, as a result of this analysis    \n  the Compensation Committee determined to    \n  expand the Peers utilized in connection     \n  with our PSUs by adding The Bank of New     \n  York Mellon Corporation and Wells Fargo\u00a0&   \n  Company, which represent the G-SIBs         \n  with the most significant business overlap  \n  beyond those already included in our Peer   \n  group. This change also reduced the         \n  proportion of European firms in our Peers.  \n  \u220e\u2009\u2009Peer group changes apply beginning with  \n  PSUs granted in January 2021. No Peer       \n  group changes have been made to PSUs        \n  previously granted.                         \n  \u220e\u2009\u2009We also determined to similarly expand   \n  our Peers for compensation benchmarking     \n  purposes more broadly.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2021          |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    39  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u0097COMPENSATION DISCUSSION\nAND ANALYSIS HOW OUR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\nMAKES DECISIONS MARKET FOR TALENT OUR PEERS\nCORE U.S. PEERS ADDITIONAL U.S. PEERS (NEW FOR\n2020) EUROPEAN PEERS BANK OF AMERICA\nCORPORATION CITIGROUP, INC.

For 2020\ncompensation, our Compensation Committee\nassessed the overall levels of equity-based\nand performance-based compensation for our\nNEOs. As a result, the Committee determined it\nwas appropriate to pay 70% of Mr. Solomon\u0092s\nand 60% of all other NEOs\u0092 variable\ncompensation in equity-based awards. Our\nExecutive Leadership Team continued to receive\ntheir 2020 equity-based annual compensation\nentirely in PSUs. For 2019, in order to\nfurther tie compensation to ongoing\nperformance metrics and further align goals\nacross our most senior leaders, our\nCompensation Committee introduced PSUs to our\nother NEOs as well as the other members of our\nManagement Committee. The Committee continued\nthis practice for 2020, with our other two\nNEOs receiving 50% of their 2020 equity-based\nannual awards in PSUs (increased from 25%) and\nother members of our Management Committee\ncontinuing to receive 25% of their 2020\nequity-based annual awards in PSUs, and in\neach case receiving the remainder in RSUs. Our\nequity-based variable compensation is subject\nto various robust risk-balancing features, as\ndescribed more fully in \u0097 Other Compensation\nPolicies and Practices.

During 2020, we made available\nto each of our Executive Leadership Team a car\nand driver and, in some cases, other services\nfor security and/or business purposes.

For a discussion of\n2020 NEO compensation, please read \u0097\nCompensation Discussion and Analysisabove.\nPursuant to SEC rules, the 2020 Summary\nCompensation Table is required to include for\na particular year only those equity-based\nawards granted during that year, rather than\nawards granted after year-end,even if awarded\nfor services in that year. SEC rules require\ndisclosure of cash compensation to be included\nin the year earned, even if payment is made\nafter year-end.

We do not consider\nthese security measures to be personal\nbenefits but rather business-related\nnecessities due to the high-profilestanding of\nour NEOs. We provide our NEOs, on the same\nterms as are provided to other PMDs and at no\nincremental out-of-pocketcost to our firm,\nwaived or reduced fees and overrides in\nconnection with investments in certain funds\nand other accounts managed or sponsored by\nGoldman Sachs, unused tickets to certain\nevents and certain negotiated discounts with\nthird-party vendors. We make available to our\nNEOs private aircraft. Our policy is to limit\npersonal use of such aircraft by our NEOs and\nto require reimbursement of the aggregate\nincremental costs to us associated with such\nuse, as permitted by Federal Aviation\nregulations. In situations where an NEO brings\na personal guest as a passenger on a business-\nrelated flight, the NEO pays us an amount\nequal to the greater of: (a) the aggregate\nincremental cost to us of the usage by the\nguest and (b) the price of a first-\nclasscommercial airline ticket for the same\ntrip.\n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2021          |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    55  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u0097EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n2020 GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS\n                             \n  2020 GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED  \n  AWARDS                     \n                             \nThe awards included in this table are 2019\nYear-EndPSUs and 2019 Year-EndRSUs, each of\nwhich were granted in January 2020 and were\npreviously described in the Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysissection of our Proxy\nStatement for our 2020 Annual Meeting of\nShareholders (dated March 20, 2020).

compensation consultant, to conduct\nan independent review of our non-\nemployeeDirector Compensation Program. FW Cook\nassessed the structure of our Director\nCompensation Program and its value compared to\ncompetitive market practices, taking into\naccount the emphasis on equity compensation,\nthe hold-though retirement requirement and\nother restrictions on the RSUs as well as the\n2020 resolution of the director compensation\nlitigation and the inclusion of a fixed amount\nof annual director compensation in the SIP. FW\nCook determined that the Director Compensation\nProgram remained competitive with the market\nand continued to align the interests of our\nnon-employeedirectors with the long-term\ninterests of our shareholders. Our Governance\nCommittee determined that FW Cook is\nindependent and does not have conflicts of\ninterest in providing services to our\nGovernance Committee.\n                                 \n  DIRECTOR SUMMARY COMPENSATION  \n  TABLE                          \n                                 \nThe following table sets forth the 2020\ncompensation for our non-employeedirectors as\ndetermined by SEC rules, which require us to\ninclude equity awards granted during2020 and\ncash compensation earned for2020.\nHistorically, we have granted equity-based\nawards to our non-employeedirectors for a\nparticular year shortly after that year\u0092s end.\nAccordingly, this table includes RSUs granted\nin January 2020 for services performed in 2019\npursuant to our 2019 Director Compensation\nProgram and levels and cash paid during 2020\n(quarterly, in arrears) for services performed\nin 2020 for those directors who elected to\nreceive cash payments.\n                                              \n           FEES                               \n          EARN\u2026                ALL            \n             OR     STOCK    OTHER     TOTAL  \n           PAID    AWARDS    COMP\u2026       ($)  \n             IN    ($)(b)    ($)(\u2026            \n           CASH                               \n          ($)(\u2026                               \n  Mic\u2026    125,\u2026    500,1\u2026    19,7\u2026    644,9\u2026  \n  Bur\u2026                                        \n  Drew    100,\u2026    500,1\u2026    16,0\u2026    616,1\u2026  \n  Fau\u2026                                        \n  Mark    100,\u2026    500,1\u2026    20,0\u2026    620,1\u2026  \n  Fla\u2026                                        \n  Ell\u2026         \u0097    592,0\u2026    20,0\u2026    612,0\u2026  \n  Kul\u2026                                        \n  Lak\u2026         \u0097    575,3\u2026         \u0097    575,3\u2026  \n  Mit\u2026                                        \n  Ade\u2026         \u0097    600,5\u2026         \u0097    600,5\u2026  \n  Ogu\u2026                                        \n  Pet\u2026         \u0097    600,5\u2026    20,0\u2026    620,5\u2026  \n  Opp\u2026                                        \n  Jan          \u0097    500,1\u2026    10,0\u2026    510,1\u2026  \n  Tig\u2026                                        \n  Dav\u2026    100,\u2026    500,1\u2026         \u0097    600,1\u2026  \n  Vin\u2026                                        \n  Mark         \u0097    600,5\u2026    45,0\u2026    645,5\u2026  \n  Win\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       For 2020, Ms.\u00a0Burns elected to         \n       receive her annual retainer and        \n  (a)  Committee Chair fee in cash, and       \n       Dr.\u00a0Faust and Messrs.

Our burn rate is further\ninflated because of our strong history of\nbuying back shares, which lowers our shares\noutstanding and consequently increases the\nburn rate. However, our share repurchases help\nus to return capital to shareholders and\nhistorically have been accretive to EPS and\nROE.

Each Award will be\nevidenced by an award agreement (together with\nany award statement or supplemental documents,\nan Award Agreement), which will govern that\nAward\u0092s terms and conditions.\n                                              \n       RSUs. An RSU is an unfunded,           \n       unsecured promise to deliver a share   \n       of Common Stock (or cash or other      \n       securities or                          \n  \u220e    property) at a future date in          \n       accordance with the terms and          \n       conditions specified in the Award      \n       Agreement (including, with respect to  \n       our PSUs, satisfaction of              \n       performance-based conditions).         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Restricted Shares. A Restricted        \n       Share, including a Share at Risk, is   \n       a share of Common Stock that is        \n       registered in                          \n       the recipient\u0092s name, but that is       \n       subject to transfer restrictions,      \n  \u220e    forfeiture provisions and/or other     \n       terms and conditions as specified in   \n       the Award Agreement. The recipient of  \n       a Restricted Share has the rights of   \n       a shareholder, including               \n       voting and dividend rights, subject    \n       to any restrictions and conditions     \n       specified in the Award Agreement.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Dividend Equivalent Rights. A          \n       Dividend Equivalent Right represents   \n       an unfunded and unsecured promise to   \n       pay to the                             \n       recipient an amount equal to all or    \n       any portion of the regular cash        \n       dividends that would be paid on        \n       shares of Common Stock if those        \n       shares were owned by the recipient. A  \n  \u220e    Dividend Equivalent Right may be       \n       granted alone or in connection with    \n       another                                \n       Award. Under the 2021 SIP, no          \n       payments will be made in respect of    \n       Dividend Equivalent Rights at a time   \n       when any applicable performance goals  \n       relating to the Dividend Equivalent    \n       Right or the related Award have not    \n       been satisfied.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Options and SARs. An option entitles   \n       the recipient to purchase a share of   \n       Common Stock at an exercise price      \n       specified in the Award Agreement       \n       (including through a cashless          \n       exercise). The 2021 SIP permits        \n       grants of options that qualify as      \n       \u0093incentive stock options\u0094 under Section  \n       422 of the Code (ISOs) and             \n       nonqualified stock options. A SAR may  \n       entitle the recipient to receive       \n       shares of Common Stock, cash or other  \n       property on the exercise date having   \n       a value equal to the excess of market  \n       value of the underlying Common Stock   \n  \u220e    over the exercise price specified in   \n       the Award Agreement. Options           \n       and SARs will become exercisable as    \n       and when specified in the Award        \n       Agreement but not later than 10 years  \n       after the date of grant. The 2021 SIP  \n       provides that we may not reset the     \n       exercise price for options and SARs    \n       and that we may not issue any          \n       options or SARs with an exercise       \n       price less than the lesser of the      \n       closing price and the average of the   \n       high and low sale prices of a share    \n       of Common Stock on the NYSE, each on   \n       the date of grant. Grants of options   \n       and SARs are subject to the            \n       individual limits described below.     \n                                              \nEligibility.The 2021 SIP permits grants of\nAwards to individuals in the following classes\nof persons: (1) any current or prospective\ndirector of Goldman Sachs, (2) any current or\nprospective officer or employee of Goldman\nSachs, (3) any current or prospective\nconsultant or other service provider to\nGoldman Sachs, and (4) any former director,\nofficer or employee of, or consultant or other\nservice provider to, Goldman Sachs solely with\nrespect to\n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2021          |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    71  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u0097ITEM 3. APPROVAL OF THE\nGOLDMAN SACHS AMENDED AND RESTATED SIP (2021)\nSUMMARY OF MATERIAL TERMS OF THE 2021 SIP\ntheir final year of service to the firm. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, Goldman Sachs had 11\ndirectors, 9 executive officers, approximately\n40,500 employees and approximately 5,300\nconsultants or other service providers to\nGoldman Sachs who are, in each case, eligible\nto participate in the 2021 SIP. Term.The 2021\nSIP will terminate at, and no more Awards will\nbe permitted to be granted thereunder without\nfurther shareholder approval on or after, the\ndate of our annual meeting of shareholders\nthat occurs in 2025. The termination of the\n2021 SIP will not affect previously granted\nAwards. Administration.The 2021 SIP generally\nwill be administered by our Compensation\nCommittee (and those to whom it delegates\nauthority), unless our Board determines\notherwise. For purposes of this summary, we\nrefer to the committee that administers the\n2021 SIP, and to any person or group to whom\nthis committee delegates authority, as the\n\u0093Committee.\u0094 The Committee is granted broad\ndiscretion to make awards under the 2021 SIP\nand to interpret and implement the 2021 SIP.\nIn exercising this authority, the Committee\n(and to the extent exercised by the Board, the\nBoard) will have no liability for any action\ntaken or omitted to be taken in good faith.\nThis means that no person, including grantees\nor Goldman Sachs shareholders, may hold the\nmembers of the Committee (or the Board)\npersonally liable for their good faith actions\nor omissions taken under the 2021 SIP. Our\nBoard, in its sole discretion, also may grant\nAwards or administer the 2021 SIP. Shares\nSubject to the Plan; Other Limitations of\nAwards.Up to approximately 70 million shares\nof Common Stock may be delivered pursuant to\nAwards granted under the 2021 SIP (i.e., 20\nmillion shares plus the additional\napproximately 50 million that remain available\nfor issuance under the 2018 SIP). These shares\nmay be newly issued shares or treasury shares.\nEach Award or share of Common Stock underlying\nan Award will count as one share of Common\nStock for these purposes. If any Award granted\nunder the 2021 SIP, 2018 SIP, 2015 SIP or 2013\nSIP is forfeited, otherwise terminated or\ncanceled without the delivery of shares of\nCommon Stock, shares of Common Stock are\nsurrendered or withheld from any Award\n(including to satisfy federal, state, local or\nforeign taxes) or shares of Common Stock are\ntendered to pay the exercise price of any\nAward granted under the 2021 SIP, 2018 SIP,\n2015 SIP or 2013 SIP, then the shares covered\nby such forfeited, terminated or canceled\nAward or equal to the number of shares\nsurrendered, withheld or tendered will again\nbecome available to be delivered pursuant to\nAwards granted under the 2021 SIP. In the case\nof an acquisition, any shares of Common Stock\nthat we deliver with respect to an Award that\nwe become obligated to make through the\nassumption of, or in substitution for,\noutstanding awards previously granted by an\nacquired entity will not count against the\nshares of Common Stock available to be\ndelivered pursuant to Awards under the 2021\nSIP. No more than 24 million shares of Common\nStock may be delivered under the 2021 SIP\npursuant to the exercise of ISOs. In the event\nof any increase or decrease in the number of\nissued shares of Common Stock (or issuance of\nshares of stock other than shares of Common\nStock) resulting from certain corporate\ntransactions that affect the capitalization of\nGoldman Sachs, the Committee will adjust the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock issuable\nunder the 2021 SIP and the terms of any\noutstanding Awards in such manner as it deems\nappropriate to prevent the enlargement or\ndilution of rights. As of March 1, 2021, the\nclosing price of a share of Common Stock on\nthe NYSE was $329.92. Fixed Amount of Non-\nEmployeeDirector Compensation.The 2021 SIP\nfixes annual compensation for each non-\nemployeedirector at an amount equal to\n$450,000, in the case of a non-\nemployeedirector who does not serve as a chair\nof a committee, and $475,000, in the case of a\nnon-employeedirector who serves as a committee\nchair. For additional detail on our non-\nemployeedirector compensation program, see\n\u0097Non-EmployeeDirector Compensation Program.\nAmendment.The Board may, at any time, suspend,\ndiscontinue, revise or amend the 2021 SIP in\nany respect whatsoever, including in any\nmanner that adversely affects the rights,\nduties or obligations of any recipients of\nAwards. In general, we will seek shareholder\napproval: (1) for any suspension,\ndiscontinuance, revision or amendment only to\nthe extent necessary to comply with any\napplicable law, rule or regulation, or (2) for\nany amendment to increase the fixed amount of\nannual non-employeedirector compensation.\n                                              \n                              PROXY\u00a0          \n                              STATEMENT\u00a0FOR\u00a0  \n  72    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    |    THE\u00a02021\u00a0       \n                              ANNUAL\u00a0MEETING  \n                              OF\u00a0             \n                              SHAREHOLDERS    \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u0097ITEM 3.

The\nCommittee may adopt procedures pursuant to\nwhich some or all recipients of RSUs or\nRestricted Shares may transfer some or all of\nthese Awards through a gift for no\nconsideration to any immediate family member\nor a trust in which the recipient and/ or the\nrecipient\u0092s immediate family members in the\naggregate have 100% (or such lesser amount as\ndetermined by the Committee from time to time)\nof the beneficial interest (as determined\npursuant to such procedures), provided that\nthe Award will continue to remain subject to\nthe same terms and conditions. In addition,\nthe Committee may adopt procedures pursuant to\nwhich a recipient may be permitted to bequeath\nsome or all of the recipient\u0092s outstanding\nRSUs under the recipient\u0092s will to a\ncharitable organization.

Recipients are advised\nto consult with their own independent tax\nadvisors with respect to the specific tax\nconsequences that, in light of their\nparticular circumstances, might arise in\nconnection with their receipt of Awards under\nthe 2021 SIP, including any state, local or\nforeign tax consequences and the effect, if\nany, of gift, estate and inheritance taxes.\nRSUs.A recipient of an RSU (whether time-\nvested or subject to achievement of\nperformance goals) will not be subject to\nincome taxation at grant. Instead, the\nrecipient will be subject to income tax at\nordinary rates on the fair market value of the\nCommon Stock (or the amount of cash) received\non the date of delivery. The recipient will be\nsubject to FICA (Social Security and Medicare)\ntax at the time any portion of such Award is\ndeemed vested for tax purposes. The fair\nmarket value of the Common Stock (if any)\nreceived on the delivery date will be the\nrecipient\u0092s tax basis for purposes of\ndetermining any subsequent gain or loss from\nthe sale of the Common Stock, and the\nrecipient\u0092s holding period with respect to\nsuch Common Stock will begin at the delivery\ndate. Gain or loss resulting from any sale of\nCommon Stock delivered to a recipient will be\ntreated as long- or short-term capital gain or\nloss depending on the holding period.\nRestricted Shares.A recipient of a Restricted\nShare will be subject to income tax at\nordinary rates, as well as FICA (Social\nSecurity and Medicare) tax, on the fair market\nvalue of the Common Stock (or the amount of\ncash) on the date that the Award is deemed\nvested for tax purposes (which may be the same\nas the grant date). The fair market value of\nthe Common Stock (if any) on this date will be\nthe recipient\u0092s tax basis for purposes of\ndetermining any subsequent gain or loss from\nthe sale of the Common Stock, and the\nrecipient\u0092s holding period with respect to\nsuch Common Stock will begin on such date.\nGain or loss resulting from any sale of Common\nStock underlying an award of Restricted Shares\nwill be treated as long- or short-term capital\ngain or loss depending on the holding period.\nIf permitted by the applicable award\nagreement, pursuant to Section 83(b) of the\nCode and the regulations thereunder and solely\nto the extent the Restricted Shares are not\nconsidered vested for tax purposes on the\ngrant date, a recipient may elect, within\nthirty days after the date of the grant of the\nRestricted Shares, to recognize as of the\ngrant date ordinary income equal to the fair\nmarket value of the shares of Common Stock\nawarded (less any amount the recipient may\nhave paid for the shares), determined on the\ndate of grant (without regard to the\nforfeiture conditions and transfer\nrestrictions). Such income will be subject to\nincome tax withholding, as well as FICA\n(Security and Medicare) tax at the time of\nmaking such election. If a recipient makes\nthis election, the recipient\u0092s holding period\nwill begin the day after the date of grant and\nno additional income will\n                                              \n                              PROXY\u00a0          \n                              STATEMENT\u00a0FOR\u00a0  \n  74    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    |    THE\u00a02021\u00a0       \n                              ANNUAL\u00a0MEETING  \n                              OF\u00a0             \n                              SHAREHOLDERS    \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u0097ITEM 3. APPROVAL OF THE\nGOLDMAN SACHS AMENDED AND RESTATED SIP (2021)\nU.S. FEDERAL TAX IMPLICATIONS OF RSUS,\nRESTRICTED SHARES, OPTIONS AND SARS be\nrecognized by the recipient on the date the\nAward is considered vested for tax purposes.\nHowever, if the recipient forfeits the\nRestricted Shares before such date the Award\nis considered vested for tax purposes, no\ndeduction or capital loss will be available\nexcept to the extent of any amounts the\nrecipient may have paid for the shares (even\nthough the recipient previously recognized\nincome with respect to such forfeited\nRestricted Shares). Nonqualified Options and\nSARs.The grant of a nonqualified option (i.e.,\nother than an ISO) or SAR will create no tax\nconsequences at the grant date for the\nrecipient or Goldman Sachs. Upon exercising\nsuch an option or SAR, the recipient will\nrecognize ordinary income equal to the excess\nof the fair market value of the shares of\nCommon Stock (and/or cash or other property)\nacquired on the date of exercise over the\nexercise price, and will be subject to FICA\ntax in respect of such amounts. A recipient\u0092s\ndisposition of Common Stock acquired upon the\nexercise of a nonqualified option or SAR\ngenerally will result in long- or short-term\ncapital gain or loss measured by the\ndifference between the sale price and the\nrecipient\u0092s tax basis in such shares (the tax\nbasis in the acquired shares of Common Stock\ngenerally being the exercise price plus any\namount recognized as ordinary income in\nconnection with the exercise of the option).\nSpecial Tax Treatment of ISOs.A recipient will\nnot recognize taxable income upon exercising\nan ISO except that the alternative minimum tax\nmay apply. Upon a disposition of Common Stock\nacquired upon exercise of an ISO before the\nend of the applicable ISO holding periods, the\nrecipient generally will recognize ordinary\nincome equal to the lesser of (i) the excess\nof the fair market value of the Common Stock\nat the date of exercise of the ISO over the\nexercise price or (ii) the amount realized\nupon the disposition of the ISO Common Stock\nover the exercise price. Otherwise, a\nrecipient\u0092s disposition of Common Stock\nacquired upon the exercise of an ISO for which\nthe ISO holding periods are met generally will\nresult in long-term capital gain or loss\nmeasured by the difference between the sale\nprice and the recipient\u0092s tax basis in such\nshares (the tax basis in the acquired shares\nof Common Stock for which the ISO holding\nperiods are met generally being the exercise\nprice of the ISO). Deduction. Goldman Sachs\ngenerally will be entitled to a tax deduction\nequal to the amount recognized as ordinary\nincome by the recipient in connection with the\ndelivery of Common Stock pursuant to an RSU,\nthe vesting of a Restricted Share or the\nexercise of an option or SAR. Goldman Sachs\nwill not be entitled to any tax deduction with\nrespect to an ISO if the recipient holds the\nshares for the ISO holding periods prior to\ndisposition of Common Stock, and is generally\nnot entitled to a tax deduction for an ISO (or\nany other award) with respect to any amount\nthat represents compensation in excess of $1\nmillion paid to \u0093covered employees\u0094 under\nSection 162(m) of the Code. Section 409A. Some\nAwards under the 2021 SIP may be considered to\nbe deferred compensation subject to special\nU.S federal income tax rules (Section 409A of\nthe Code). Failure to satisfy the applicable\nrequirements under these provisions for Awards\nconsidered deferred compensation would result\nin the acceleration of income and additional\nincome tax liability to the recipient,\nincluding certain penalties. The 2021 SIP and\nAwards under the 2021 SIP are intended to be\ndesigned and administered so that any Awards\nunder the 2021 SIP that are considered to be\ndeferred compensation will not give rise to\nany negative tax consequences to the recipient\nunder these provisions.\n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2021          |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    75  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nAUDIT MATTERS\u0097ITEM 4.

Shareholder Proposal Regarding\nShareholder Right to Act by Written Consent\nJohn Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205,\nRedondo Beach, California, 90278, beneficial\nowner of 20 shares of Common Stock, is the\nproponent of the following shareholder\nproposal. The proponent has advised us that a\nrepresentative will present the proposal and\nrelated supporting statement at our Annual\nMeeting.\n              \n  PROPONENT\u0092S  \n  STATEMENT   \n              \nProposal 5 - Shareholder Right to Act by\nWritten Consent Shareholders request that our\nboard of directors take such steps as may be\nnecessary to permit written consent by\nshareholders entitled to cast the minimum\nnumber of votes that would be necessary to\nauthorize the action at a meeting at which all\nshareholders entitled to vote thereon were\npresent and voting. This includes shareholder\nability to initiate any appropriate topic for\nwritten consent. This proposal topic won\n88%-support at an AT&T annual meeting. And\nthis was before the shareholder right to call\na special in-personshareholder meeting was\neliminated by the 2020 pandemic. Goldman Sachs\nmanagement put up a smoke screen of outlandish\ntheoretical objections to this proposal topic\nin 2020 but failed to give a single example of\nits theoretical objections ever taking place\nat any company whatsoever. The Bank of New\nYork Mellon Corporation (BK) said it adopted\nwritten consent in 2019 after 45%-support for\na written consent shareholder proposal. And\nthis BK action was a year before the pandemic\nput an end to in-personshareholder meetings -\nperhaps forever. It is so much easier for\nmanagement to conduct an online shareholder\nmeeting that management is now spoiled and\nwill never want to return to an in-\npersonshareholder meeting. Also it currently\nit takes the formal backing 25% of all shares\nin existence to call for the newly downgraded\nspecial meeting, which can be an online\nmeeting. This means that it takes the backing\nof almost 33% of the shares that normally cast\nballots at the annual meeting to call for a\nspecial shareholder meeting. Shareholders need\nto be able to accomplish more outside of a\nshareholder meeting due to the onslaught of\nonline shareholder meetings replacing in-\npersonshareholder meetings. With the near\nuniversal use of online annual shareholder\nmeetings, which can last only\n10-minutes,shareholders no longer have the\nright to engage with management and directors\nat a shareholder meeting. Special shareholder\nmeetings can now be online meetings which has\nan inferior format to even a Zoom meeting.\nShareholders are also severely restricted in\nmaking their views known at online shareholder\nmeetings because all challenging questions and\ncomments can be screened out. For instance the\nGoodyear shareholder meeting was spoiled by a\ntrigger-happy management mute button for\nshareholders. And AT&T would not allow\nshareholders to speak.\n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2021          |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    79  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nITEMS 5-8.SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS Please see:\nGoodyear\u0092s virtual meeting creates issues with\nshareholder https://www.crainscleveland.com/ma\nnufacturing/goodyears-virtual-meeting-creates-\nissues-shareholder Please see: AT&T investors\ndenied a dial-inas annual meeting goes online\nhttps://whbl.com/2020/04/17/att-investors-\ndenied-a-dial-in-as-annual-meeting-goes-\nonline/1007928/ Now more than ever\nshareholders need to have the option to take\naction outside of a shareholder meeting and\nsend a wake-upcall to management, if need be,\nsince tightly controlled online shareholder\nmeetings are a shareholder engagement\nwasteland.

Our Board\nregularly seeks input from shareholders to\nensure our policies reflect best practices and\nare appropriately aligned with shareholder\ninterests. We appreciate that certain of our\nshareholders may view action by written\nconsent as an important right (so long as\nproper protections are included), and we\nacknowledge that views vary across our diverse\nshareholder base. We appreciate the concerns\nraised by the proponent in his proposal\nregarding the conduct of certain virtual\nannual meetings in 2020. In evaluating this\nproposal, we took stock of the procedures at\nour 2020 virtual annual meeting, including\nthat all shareholder proponents were permitted\nto present their proposals live, shareholders\nwere able to submit questions both before and\nduring a clearly designated portion of the\nannual meeting and the text of shareholder\nquestions were generally not modified and were\nread out by our Chairman and CEO as submitted.\nOver the course of our extensive shareholder\nengagement since our 2020 virtual annual\nmeeting \u0097 including with the proponent \u0097 we\nare not aware of any shareholders who had\nconcerns or complaints regarding the way in\nwhich we conducted our 2020 Annual Meeting.\nOur Board continues to believe that, as\nproposed, permitting shareholder action by\nwritten consent does not promote transparency\nand does not contain necessary shareholder\nprotections. Given our ongoing commitment to\ncorporate governance best practices, including\nBoard-level engagement with stakeholders and\ncommitment to shareholder meeting best\npractices, we continue to believe that the\nadoption of this proposal is unnecessary and\nnot in the best interests of our firm or our\nshareholders.\n                                              \n       We are committed to active engagement  \n       with our shareholders and other        \n       stakeholders. Core to this is the      \n       ability for                            \n  \u220e    shareholders to raise important        \n       matters to our attention, including    \n       in the context of a shareholders\u0092       \n       meeting where all shareholders have    \n       proper notice and the ability to       \n       participate.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n     In addition to governance practices      \n     that enhance the rights of all           \n     shareholders (examples of which are      \n  \u00bb  described below),                        \n     our firm and our Board maintain open     \n     lines of communication with our          \n     shareholders (see Stakeholder            \n     Engagement).                             \n                                              \n                                              \n     For example, during 2020 our Lead        \n     Director met with shareholders           \n     representing over 25% of our shares      \n     outstanding on                           \n  \u00bb  topics such as Board effectiveness,      \n     compensation, the Board\u0092s independent     \n     oversight of strategy, culture and       \n     reputational risk and Board and          \n     executive succession planning.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Matters to be acted on by              \n       shareholders should be communicated    \n       to and voted on by all shareholders    \n  \u220e    in the context of an                   \n       annual or special meeting, with        \n       adequate time to consider the matters  \n       proposed.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Our governing documents provide          \n     protections, such as advance notice and  \n     thorough public disclosure to all        \n  \u00bb  shareholders,                            \n     for the conduct of business at annual    \n     and special meetings to ensure a         \n     transparent, well- informed, fair and    \n     equitable process.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n                              PROXY\u00a0          \n                              STATEMENT\u00a0FOR\u00a0  \n  80    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    |    THE\u00a02021\u00a0       \n                              ANNUAL\u00a0MEETING  \n                              OF\u00a0             \n                              SHAREHOLDERS    \n                                              \nITEMS 5-8.SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\n                                              \n     In contrast, if shareholders are         \n     permitted to act by written consent as   \n     proposed, nearly half of our             \n     shareholders could                       \n  \u00bb  be deprived of these important rights    \n     and of the opportunity to participate    \n     in decisions that could have             \n     significant ramifications for our firm   \n     and shareholders.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n     Annual and special meetings also allow   \n     opportunity for discussion and           \n  \u00bb  interaction amongst shareholders and     \n     management so                            \n     that all points of view may be           \n     considered prior to a vote.              \n                                              \n                                              \n       In addition to our shareholder right   \n       to call a special meeting and          \n       demonstrated commitment to             \n  \u220e    shareholder engagement, we             \n       maintain strong governance practices   \n       that protect the rights of all         \n       shareholders.

The proponent has\nadvised us that a representative will present\nthe proposal and related supporting statement\nat our Annual Meeting.\n              \n  PROPONENT\u0092S  \n  STATEMENT   \n              \nRESOLVED: Shareholders of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. (\u0093Goldman Sachs\u0094) ask the Board of\nDirectors to oversee the preparation of a\npublic report on the impact of the use of\nmandatory arbitration on Goldman Sachs\u0092s\nemployees and workplace culture. The report\nshould evaluate the impact of Goldman Sachs\u0092s\ncurrent use of arbitration on the prevalence\nof harassment and discrimination in its\nworkplace and on employees\u0092 ability to seek\nredress. The report should be prepared at\nreasonable cost and omit proprietary and\npersonal information. WHEREAS: Title VII of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that it is\nunlawful \u0093to discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment, because of such individual\u0092s race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin.\u0094\n1Nevertheless, 48 percent of African Americans\nand 36 percent of Hispanics have experienced\nrace-based workplace discrimination. 2More\nthan half of senior-level women say that they\nhave been sexually harassed during their\ncareers, with African American women facing an\nincreased relative risk of sexual harassment\nin the workplace. 3 A workplace that tolerates\nharassment invites legal, brand, financial and\nhuman capital risk. Companies may experience\nreduced morale, lost productivity, absenteeism\nand challenges in attracting and retaining\ntalent. Unexpected leadership changes\nfollowing allegations of harassment or\ndiscrimination put shareholder value at risk.\nIn contrast, research by McKinsey & Company\nfound that companies with high levels of\nethnic and cultural diversity are 33 percent\nmore likely to outperform in profitability\nwhile those in the top quartile for gender\ndiversity are 27 percent more likely to have\nsuperior value creation. 4A study by the Wall\nStreet Journal found that over the five-\nyearperiod ended June 28, 2019, the 20 most\ndiverse companies in the S&P 500 had an\naverage annual stock return that was almost\nsix percent higher than the 20 least-diverse\ncompanies. 5 Goldman Sachs requires its\nemployees to agree to arbitrate employment-\nrelated claims. Mandatory arbitration limits\nemployees\u0092 remedies for wrongdoing, keeps\nmisconduct secret and prevents employees from\nlearning about shared concerns. 6 Arbitration\nclauses face a changing regulatory landscape.\nAttorneys general from every state voiced\nsupport for ending forced arbitration of\nsexual harassment claims in 2018. In 2019, the\nU.S. House of Representatives passed a bill\nbanning mandatory arbitration. California\nbanned the use of arbitration agreements as a\ncondition of employment, Washington state\ninvalidated contracts requiring arbitration of\nsexual harassment claims and the New York\nSupreme Court refused to compel arbitration in\na harassment lawsuit. Continuing to rely on\narbitration clauses for protections, when\nthese may be removed retroactively, creates a\nlong-tail risk for our company. Investors\u0092\nconcerns about arbitration\u0092s potential to\nallow harassment and discrimination to go\nunseen are pertinent to Goldman Sachs, where\nthousands of women have alleged gender bias.\n                                              \n  1  https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/tit\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  2  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/polit\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-meto\u2026  \n     https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ab\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckin\u2026  \n     delivering-through-diversity_full-repo\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  5  https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-busin\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  6  https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/systemic/rev\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n                              PROXY\u00a0          \n                              STATEMENT\u00a0FOR\u00a0  \n  82    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    |    THE\u00a02021\u00a0       \n                              ANNUAL\u00a0MEETING  \n                              OF\u00a0             \n                              SHAREHOLDERS    \n                                              \nITEMS 5-8.SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\n                  \n  DIRECTORS\u0092       \n  RECOMMENDATION  \n                  \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE\nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. We share the\nproponent\u0092s views relating to workplace\nharassment and discrimination. As our Chairman\nand CEO recently reinforced, in no uncertain\nterms, there is no place at Goldman Sachs for\ndiscrimination or harassment against any\nindividual or group in any form. A cornerstone\nof our culture is our commitment to providing\na safe and inclusive workplace for all\nemployees. These values are embedded in and\nregularly reinforced at, every step of our\npeople\u0092s careers, from onboarding to training\nand performance, development, compensation and\npromotion processes. Further, our policies and\npractices were recently reviewed and enhanced\nin the context of the \u0093Me Too\u0094 movement. Our\narbitration program, which provides mutual\nbenefits to the firm and our people, is in\ncompliance with all relevant rules and\nregulations. We do not believe that there is\nany limitation on our employees\u0092 ability to\nseek redress of any claim, including\nemployment-related claims. To this end, in\nlight of our \u0093zero tolerance\u0094 approach to\nharassment and discrimination, our robust\nfirmwide controls designed to prevent and\naddress employee misconduct and our ongoing\ncommitments to promote diversity and\ninclusion, we believe that the adoption of\nthis proposal is unnecessary and not in the\nbest interest of our firm or our shareholders.\n                                              \n       We believe disputes between our        \n       employees and the firm are best        \n       resolved in arbitration, regardless    \n       of who the employee                    \n  \u220e    is or what claim they are asserting.   \n       Arbitration provides important         \n       benefits to both employers and         \n       employees and is in no way used to     \n       cover up \u0093bad behavior.\u0094                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     Our arbitration provisions expressly     \n     carve out reports to, and charges filed  \n  \u00bb  with, government agencies, including     \n     the                                      \n     SEC, the Equal Employment Opportunity    \n     Commission and state agencies.           \n                                              \n                                              \n     We encourage employees to come forward   \n  \u00bb  to report misconduct through our         \n     robust, multi-channel internal and       \n     external complaint process.              \n                                              \n                                              \n     We maintain a disciplinary framework     \n     approved by our prudential regulators    \n  \u00bb  to ensure that misconduct, including     \n     harassment and discrimination, is        \n     investigated and addressed.              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Many of the firm\u0092s employees (including   \n     investment bankers, traders and private  \n     wealth advisors) are required            \n     to arbitrate any claims with the firm    \n  \u00bb  under FINRA rules. Our arbitration       \n     program, which is in compliance with     \n     all relevant rules and regulations,      \n     applies these rules consistently across  \n     the firm.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Arbitration provides a number of       \n  \u220e    mutual benefits to the firm and our    \n       people, including:                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     Quicker resolution of disputes: The      \n     arbitration process is more efficient    \n     and streamlined than litigation in       \n     court; parties have their disputes       \n  \u00bb  resolved much more quickly in            \n     arbitration than in court, where         \n     appeals and delays relating to           \n     discovery and motion practice can        \n     result in multi-year litigation.         \n                                              \n                                              \n     Lower costs for both parties: Because    \n     of the speed of resolution, it           \n  \u00bb  typically costs less to arbitrate than   \n     to                                       \n     litigate for all parties involved.       \n                                              \n                                              \n     No limitation on rights or remedies:     \n     Arbitrators are required to follow the   \n     same substantive laws that exist in      \n  \u00bb  court proceedings, and are permitted to  \n     award the same remedies available in     \n     court, including compensatory damages,   \n     punitive damages and attorneys\u0092 fees.     \n                                              \n                                              \n     Flexibility: Arbitration offers          \n     flexibility to tailor proceedings to     \n  \u00bb  parties\u0092 needs and preferences. In        \n     addition, the parties jointly select     \n     the arbitrator, whereas in court the     \n     judge is assigned.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       We have robust firmwide controls       \n       designed to encourage reporting and    \n       prevent and address employee           \n  \u220e    misconduct.

Such a\nchange would enable the company to operate in\na responsible and sustainable manner that\nbalances the stockholders\u0092 pecuniary\ninterests, and the best interests of those\nstakeholders affected by the corporation\u0092s\nconduct.

We have long\nbelieved that a company should benefit all of\nits stakeholders, including its employees,\nclients, communities, shareholders, vendors\nand suppliers, and this approach is embedded\nin all that we do. Our ability to successfully\nexecute on our purpose \u0097 advancing sustainable\neconomic growth and financial opportunity \u0097\nand drive long-term shareholder value is\nintegrally related to how well we serve our\nclients and customers, manage our people and\nsupport our broader stakeholders, including\nthe communities in which we live and work. We\nare proud to have been a signatory to the\nBusiness Roundtable\u0092s Statement on the Purpose\nof a Corporation in 2019, which was a\nreflection of our long-standing principles and\nour governance and management framework. In\nlight of our ongoing focus on advancing the\ninterests of all of our stakeholders, as well\nas various considerations relating to the\npracticality and appropriateness of converting\nto a public benefit corporation, particularly\nfor a financial services firm, we believe that\nthe adoption of this proposal is unnecessary\nand not in the best interests of our firm or\nour shareholders.\n                                              \n       Our firm\u0092s foundational documents       \n       already expressly provide for the      \n  \u220e    consideration of stakeholder           \n       interests in                           \n       taking any corporate action \u0096 and have  \n       done so since our IPO.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     Since our initial public offering, our   \n     Certificate of Incorporation has         \n     explicitly provided for the              \n     consideration of                         \n     stakeholder interests \u0097 together with     \n     the interests of our shareholders \u0097 in    \n  \u00bb  connection with the taking of any        \n     corporate action. This includes our      \n     current and retired employees, our       \n     clients and customers and our            \n     contributions to our                     \n     communities, among other                 \n     considerations.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     This clearly demonstrates that in our    \n     current corporate form we are permitted  \n  \u00bb  to \u0097 and do \u0097 appropriately                \n     consider stakeholder interests in order  \n     to carry out our purpose and drive       \n     shareholder value.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Converting to a public benefit         \n       corporation could create unnecessary   \n  \u220e    cost and uncertainty, while providing  \n       shareholders                           \n       and other stakeholders with limited,   \n       if any, benefit.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n     Operational and Market Uncertainty. To   \n     our knowledge, only a handful of U.S.    \n     publicly traded corporations are, or     \n     have newly converted to be, public       \n     benefit corporations, and no major       \n     global financial institutions are        \n  \u00bb  public benefit corporations. As a        \n     result, there could be operational and   \n     market uncertainty, which could impact   \n     our ability to attract investors,        \n     should we even receive the necessary     \n     support from shareholders to undertake   \n     such a conversion. For example:          \n                                              \n                                              \n    There is no case law in Delaware that     \n    provides guidance regarding the           \n    balancing of obligations of directors of  \n    public benefit                            \n    corporations when the interests of        \n    shareholders and other stakeholders or    \n    the public benefit diverge. Given this,   \n    we may have difficulty attracting and     \n    retaining qualified directors for the     \n    public benefit corporation.               \n                                              \n                                              \n    There could be market uncertainty given   \n    the difficulty in assessing the impact    \n    of such a conversion on our short-term    \n    and long-term stock                       \n    price, market capitalization and overall  \n    operational and financial performance.    \n                                              \n                                              \n    There may be a destabilizing effect on    \n    our international operations, as the      \n    feasibility and impact of converting to   \n    a public benefit                          \n    corporation would need to be reviewed in  \n    each of the jurisdictions where the firm  \n    currently operates.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n     Regulatory Uncertainty and Oversight.    \n     As a participant in the global           \n     financial services industry, we are      \n     subject                                  \n     to extensive regulation and supervision  \n     worldwide, which regulation and          \n     supervision take into account the        \n     interests of constituencies other than   \n     shareholders in their regulatory         \n     oversight functions.

The proponent\nhas advised us that a representative will\npresent the proposal and related supporting\nstatement at our Annual Meeting.\n                        \n  PROPONENT\u0092S STATEMENT  \n                        \nRESOLVED that shareholders of Goldman Sachs\nGroup Inc. (\u0093Goldman\u0094) urge the Board of\nDirectors to oversee a racial equity audit\nanalyzing Goldman\u0092s impacts on nonwhite\nstakeholders and communities of color. Input\nfrom civil rights organizations, employees,\nand customers should be considered in\ndetermining the specific matters to be\nanalyzed. A report on the audit, prepared at\nreasonable cost and omitting confidential and\nproprietary information, should be publicly\ndisclosed on Goldman\u0092s website. SUPPORTING\nSTATEMENT High-profile police killings of\nblack people\u0097most recently George Floyd\u0097have\ngalvanized the movement for racial justice.\nThat movement, together with the\ndisproportionate impacts of the\nCOVID-19pandemic, have focused the attention\nof media, the public and policy makers on\nsystemic racism, racialized violence and\ninequities in employment, health care, and the\ncriminal justice system. Goldman touts its $10\nmillion Fund for Racial Equity, which will\n\u0093support organizations addressing racial\ninjustice,\u0094 and the $17 million it \u0093deployed\u0094\nto \u0093organizations supporting [COVID-19]relief\nefforts in communities of color.\u0094 1We urge\nGoldman to implement its commitment to racial\njustice by assessing its impacts on nonwhite\nstakeholders and communities of color.\nAlthough Goldman has set diversity goals for\nits professional workforce, it faces\nchallenges with respect to inclusion. A viral\nJune 2020 email from a black managing director\nstated: \u0093[W]hile our firm expresses a\ncommitment to equality and social justice up\ntop, [junior colleagues] don\u0092t necessarily see\ncommitment and support from their direct\nmanagers.\u0094 2 Goldman underwrites municipal\nbonds whose proceeds pay police brutality\nsettlements. For example, Goldman was lead\nunderwriter for a 2017 Chicago offering that\nallocated $225 million for settlements and\njudgments. One report characterized these\nbonds as \u0093a transfer of wealth from over-\npoliced communities of color to Wall Street\nand wealthy investors.\u0094 3 Goldman\u0092s\nphilanthropy fund has donated to the Los\nAngeles and New York City police foundations\n4and the company reportedly sponsors the Salt\nLake City police foundation. 5Goldman Sachs\nAsset Management co-chairedthe New York City\npolice foundation\u0092s 2019 annual gala. 6Police\nfoundations buy equipment for police\ndepartments, including surveillance technology\nthat has been used to target communities of\ncolor and nonviolent protestors. Although\nGoldman does not disclose all of its trade\nassociations, it lists membership in the\nSecurities Industry Financial Markets\nAssociation (\u0093SIFMA\u0094) in its \u0093Statement on\nPolicy Engagement and Political\nParticipation.\u0094 7SIFMA lobbied most frequently\nin the current Congress on the Wall Street Tax\nAct of 2019, which would tax financial\ntransactions. 8Supporters argue that the\nrevenue raised through the tax could fund\nmeasures such as student loan forgiveness and\nthe Green New Deal, 9which would mitigate\nimpacts of systemic racism. 10 We urge Goldman\nto assess its behavior through a racial equity\nlens to identify how it contributes to\nsystemic racism, including areas of\nmisalignment between Goldman\u0092s stated values\nand the impacts of its actions, and could\nbegin to help dismantle it.\n                                              \n  1  https://www.goldmansachs.com/citizensh\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  2  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa\u2026  \n     firm-idUSKBN23C086                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  http://nathancummings.org/wp-content/u\u2026  \n     at 7.                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://projects.propublica.org/nonpro\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  5  https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  6  https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  7  https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  8  https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs//summ\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n     E.g.,                                    \n  9  https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blo\u2026  \n     https://www.cfo.com/tax/2019/05/bernie\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n      See                                     \n  10  https://www.marketwatch.com/story/you\u2026  \n      https://www.cjr.org/covering_climate_\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n                              PROXY\u00a0          \n                              STATEMENT\u00a0FOR\u00a0  \n  88    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    |    THE\u00a02021\u00a0       \n                              ANNUAL\u00a0MEETING  \n                              OF\u00a0             \n                              SHAREHOLDERS    \n                                              \nITEMS 5-8.SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\n                  \n  DIRECTORS\u0092       \n  RECOMMENDATION  \n                  \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE\nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. We share the\nproponent\u0092s focus on advancing racial equity.\nThe recent senseless acts of racism and\nviolence against Black people serve as a\ndeeply upsetting reminder for all of us that\nsignificant work in this area remains.\nEnhancing racial equity, including by driving\ninclusive growth, is not only the right thing\nto do, it is core to our purpose and how we do\nbusiness, and we are committed to promoting\ndiversity, equity and inclusion in all that we\ndo both internally and externally.

Related Person\nTransactions Policy Our Board has a written\nRelated Person Transactions Policy regarding\nthe review and approval of transactions\nbetween us and \u0093related persons\u0094 (directors,\nexecutive officers, immediate family members\nof a director or executive officer, or known\n5% shareholders). Under this policy,\ntransactions that exceed $120,000 in which a\nrelated person may have or may be deemed to\nhave a direct or indirect material interest\nare submitted to our Governance Committee\nChair, our Audit Committee Chair or our full\nGovernance Committee for approval, as\napplicable. Certain transactions, including\nemployment relationships, ordinary course\nbanking, brokerage, investment, lending and\nother services, payment of certain regulatory\nfiling fees and certain other ordinary course\nnon-preferentialtransactions, are considered\npreapproved transactions, and thus do not\nrequire specific approval under the policy\n(although these transactions must be reported\nto our Governance Committee and may still be\nsubmitted for approval if deemed appropriate).\nIn determining whether to approve a related\nperson transaction, the following factors,\namong others, are considered:\n                                              \n       Whether the transaction would impair   \n  \u220e    the independence of an independent     \n       director;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction presents a     \n       conflict of interest, taking into      \n       account the size of the transaction,   \n       the financial                          \n  \u220e    position of the director or executive  \n       officer, the nature of the director\u0092s   \n       or executive officer\u0092s interest in the  \n       transaction and the ongoing nature of  \n       the transaction;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction is fair and    \n       reasonable to us and on substantially  \n  \u220e    the same terms as would apply to       \n       comparable third                       \n       parties;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    The business reasons for the           \n       transaction;                           \n                                              \n                                     \n  \u220e    Any reputational issues; and  \n                                     \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction is material,   \n  \u220e    taking into account the significance   \n       of the transaction to our investors.   \n                                              \nIn addition to our policies on director\nindependence and related person transactions,\nwe also maintain a policy with respect to\noutside director involvement with financial\nfirms, such as private equity firms or hedge\nfunds. Under this policy, in determining\nwhether to approve any current or proposed\naffiliation of a non-employee director with a\nfinancial firm, our Board will consider, among\nother things, the legal, reputational,\noperational and business issues presented, and\nthe nature, feasibility and scope of any\nrestrictions, procedures or other steps that\nwould be necessary or appropriate to\nameliorate any perceived or potential future\nconflicts or other issues.\n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2021          |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    91  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED\nTRANSACTIONS\u0097CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND\nTRANSACTIONS Certain Relationships and\nTransactions\n                                  \n  BROKERAGE AND BANKING SERVICES  \n                                  \nSome of our directors and executive officers\n(and persons or entities affiliated with them)\nhave brokerage and/ or discretionary accounts\nat our broker-dealer affiliates and may\nutilize other ordinary course banking or\nlending products (such as credit cards)\noffered by Goldman Sachs Bank USA.

We believe the\nopportunity to make such investments helps to\npromote teamwork and collaboration across the\nfirm and provides alignment with the firm\u0092s\nstrategy to grow the alternatives business.\nInvestment decisions for the Employee Funds\nare made by the investment teams or committees\nthat are fiduciaries for such funds, and no\nexecutive officers are members of such\ninvestment teams or committees. The Employee\nFunds generally maintain diversified\ninvestment portfolios, and these investment\nopportunities do not affect the incentives of\nour executive officers under our compensation\nprogram. Many of our employees, their spouses,\nrelated charitable foundations or entities\nthey own or control have invested in these\nEmployee Funds. In some cases, we have limited\nparticipation to our PMDs, including our\nexecutive officers, and in some cases\nparticipation may be limited to individuals\neligible to invest pursuant to applicable law.\nCertain of the Employee Funds provide\napplicable investors with an interest in the\noverrides we receive for managing the funds\nfor independent investors (overrides), which\nmay vary based on certain criteria. Employee\nFunds generally do not require our current or\nretired PMDs and other current or retired\nemployees to pay management fees and do not\ndeduct overrides from fund distributions.\nSimilarly, certain other investments may be\nmade available to our PMDs, retired PMDs and\nother current employees on a fee-freeor\nreduced fee basis. Distributions and\nredemptions exceeding $120,000 from Employee\nFunds made to our 2020 executive officers (or\npersons or certain entities affiliated with\nthem) and Mr. Viniar (with respect to\ninvestments made when he was an employee)\nduring 2020, consisting of profits and other\nincome and return of amounts initially\ninvested (excluding overrides generally\navailable only to PMDs, which are discussed\nbelow), were approximately, in the aggregate,\nas follows: Mr. Solomon\u0097$13.1 million; Mr.\nWaldron\u0097$2.3 million; Mr. Scherr\u0097$2.2 million;\nMr. Rogers\u0097$3.6 million; Elizabeth M.

Subject to applicable laws,\nin addition, certain of our directors and\nexecutive officers may from time to time\ninvest their personal funds in other funds or\ninvestments that we have established and that\nwe manage or sponsor.

Mr.\nMittal is the Executive Chairman and former\nCEO of ArcelorMittal S.A. and beneficially\nowns (directly and indirectly) approximately\n37% of the outstanding common shares of\nArcelorMittal. Goldman Sachs provides ordinary\ncourse financial advisory, lending, investment\nbanking, trading (such as acting as a\ncommodities derivative counter-party from time\nto time) and other financial services to\nArcelorMittal and its affiliates, including as\ndescribed below. Goldman Sachs participates in\na $5.5 billion five-year revolving credit\nfacility for ArcelorMittal, which facility was\nextended during 2020. Under this $5.5 billion\nfacility, Goldman Sachs has agreed to lend to\nArcelorMittal up to $170 million at an\ninterest rate of Libor + 55 basis points\n(which rate may vary depending on\nArcelorMittal\u0092s credit ratings). Goldman Sachs\ncurrently has no loan outstanding under this\nfacility. Goldman Sachs also participated in a\n$4.8 billion acquisition bridge facility,\npursuant to which the firm had agreed to lend\nto an acquisition joint venture up to\napproximately $252 million (repayment of which\nwas guaranteed by ArcelorMittal) at an\ninterest rate of Libor + 50 basis points\n(which rate would increase depending on the\nbridge facility\u0092s time to maturity). This\nfacility was repaid in full as of March 2020.\nGoldman Sachs also participates in a $212.5\nmillion credit facility for an entity in which\nArcelorMittal is an approximately 25%\nshareholder. Under the facility, Goldman Sachs\nhas agreed to lend up to approximately $22.5\nmillion at an interest rate of Libor + 450\nbasis points. Goldman Sachs currently has no\nloan outstanding under this facility. In\nSeptember 2020, it was announced that Goldman\nSachs acted as financial advisor and provided\ncertain financing to its third-party client,\nwho in December 2020 acquired substantially\nall of the operations of a subsidiary of\nArcelorMittal in a $3.3 billion transaction.\nGoldman Sachs had previously participated in a\n$1 billion five-year asset-backed revolving\ncredit facility for this subsidiary of\nArcelorMittal. Under such facility, the firm\nhad agreed to lend up to $6.1 million at an\ninterest rate of Libor + 125 to 175 basis\npoints (varying depending on a fixed charge\ncoverage ratio). Goldman Sachs did not make\nany loan under this facility during 2020, and,\nin connection with the acquisition, this\nfacility is no longer outstanding. In May\n2020, Goldman Sachs participated in a $3\nbillion 364-daysyndicated term loan for\nArcelorMittal. Under the term loan, Goldman\nSachs agreed to lend to ArcelorMittal up to\n$230 million at an interest rate of Libor +\n167 basis points. The undrawn term loan\nfacility was partially canceled in May 2020 in\nconnection with the proceeds of a $2 billion\ncombined public offering of ordinary shares\nand mandatory convertible notes, and the\nremaining commitment of $76.8 million was\ncanceled in July of 2020. Each of these\ntransactions was conducted on, and all of\nthese services were provided on, an\narm\u0092s-lengthbasis.

During 2020, Goldman Sachs acted as\nfinancial advisor to a third-party client that\nacquired a GIP fund\u0092s stake in a portfolio\ncompany in an approximately \u0080550 million\ntransaction resulting from a competitive\nbidding process. In 2021, Goldman Sachs acted\nas an underwriter in an approximately $145\nmillion public common stock offering for a\ncompany in which a fund managed by GIP was a\nselling stockholder and received approximately\n$70 million of proceeds of the offering.\nGoldman Sachs\u0092 relationship with this company\npre-dates GIP\u0092s investment therein. This\ntransaction was conducted on, and these\nservices were provided on, an\narm\u0092s-lengthbasis. During 2020, Goldman Sachs\nmaintained its consulting relationship with a\ncompany for which the spouse of Mr. Rogers\nserves as CEO and founding partner; the\nservice agreement provides for annual fees of\napproximately $1 million to provide advice and\ninsights in support of the firm\u0092s business\nstrategy in China.

We  \n       believe that the fees paid to The      \n       Vanguard Group through the Vanguard    \n       mutual fund are the same as the fees   \n       that are paid by the other holders of  \n  (c)  the same share class of that fund.     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2021          |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    97  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION Additional Information\nHow to Contact Us Across our shareholder base\nthere is a wide variety of viewpoints about\nmatters affecting our firm.

      \nWho counts the votes cast at our Annual\nMeeting? Representatives of Broadridge will\ntabulate the votes cast at our Annual Meeting,\nand American Election Services, LLC will act\nas the independent inspector of election. How\nis voting affected by shareholders who\nparticipate in certain Goldman Sachs Partner\nCompensation plans? Employees of Goldman Sachs\nwho participate in the PCP are \u0093covered\npersons\u0094 under our Shareholders\u0092 Agreement.\nOur Shareholders\u0092 Agreement governs, among\nother things, the voting of shares of Common\nStock owned by each covered person directly or\njointly with a spouse (but excluding shares\nacquired under our 401(k) Plan). Shares of\nCommon Stock subject to our Shareholders\u0092\nAgreement are called \u0093voting shares.\u0094 Our\nShareholders\u0092 Agreement requires that before\nany of our shareholders vote, a separate,\npreliminary vote is held by the persons\ncovered by our Shareholders\u0092 Agreement. In the\nelection of directors, all voting shares will\nbe voted in favor of the election of the\ndirector nominees receiving the highest\nnumbers of votes cast by the covered persons\nin the preliminary vote. For all other\nmatters, all voting shares will be voted in\naccordance with the majority of the votes cast\nby the covered persons in the preliminary\nvote. If you are a party to our Shareholders\u0092\nAgreement, you previously gave an irrevocable\nproxy to our Shareholders\u0092 Committee to vote\nyour voting shares at our Annual Meeting in\naccordance with the preliminary vote, and to\nvote on any other matters that may come before\nour Annual Meeting as the proxy holder sees\nfit in a manner that is not inconsistent with\nthe preliminary vote and that does not\nfrustrate the intent of the preliminary vote.\nAs of March 1, 2021, 8,610,503 shares of\nCommon Stock were beneficially owned by the\nparties to the Shareholders\u0092 Agreement. Each\nperson who is a party to our Shareholders\u0092\nAgreement disclaims beneficial ownership of\nthe shares subject to the agreement that are\nowned by any other party. As of March 1, 2021,\n7,926,261 of the outstanding shares of Common\nStock that were held by parties to our\nShareholders\u0092 Agreement were subject to the\nvoting provisions of our Shareholders\u0092\nAgreement (representing approximately 2.31% of\nthe outstanding shares entitled to vote at our\nAnnual Meeting). The preliminary vote with\nrespect to the voting shares will be concluded\non or about April 16, 2021. Other than this\nShareholders\u0092 Agreement (which covers our\nChairman and CEO, who is also a director),\nthere are no voting agreements by or among any\nof our directors. Where can I find the voting\nresults of our Annual Meeting? We expect to\nannounce the preliminary voting results at our\nAnnual Meeting. The final voting results will\nbe reported in a Current Report on Form\n8-Kthat will be posted on our website.\n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2021         |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    105  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS When will Goldman\nSachs next hold an advisory vote on the\nfrequency of Say on Pay votes?

ROTE is calculated by\ndividing net earnings applicable to common\nshareholders by average monthly tangible\ncommon shareholders\u0092 equity (tangible common\nshareholders\u0092 equity is calculated as total\nshareholders\u0092 equity less preferred stock,\ngoodwill and identifiable intangible assets).\nManagement believes that ROTE is meaningful\nbecause it measures the performance of\nbusinesses consistently, whether they were\nacquired or developed internally, and that\ntangible common shareholders\u0092 equity is\nmeaningful because it is a measure that the\nfirm and investors use to assess capital\nadequacy. ROTE and tangible common\nshareholders\u0092 equity are non-GAAPmeasures and\nmay not be comparable to similar non-\nGAAPmeasures used by other companies. The\ntable below presents a reconciliation of\naverage common shareholders\u0092 equity to average\ntangible common shareholders\u0092 equity:\n                                              \n
