The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a      \nvoting interest entity or a variable interest \nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)   \nthe total equity investment at risk is        \nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity  \nholders have the power to direct the          \nactivities of the entity that most            \nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the    \nentity and the right to receive the residual  \nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting  \ninterest entity is ownership of a majority    \nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest \nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable  \nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that    \nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a \nvoting interest entity. The firm has a        \ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when  \nthe firm has a variable interest or interests \nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct  \nthe activities of the VIE that most           \nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic       \nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb \nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive     \nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially  \nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for    \nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method \nInvestments. When the firm does not have a    \ncontrolling financial interest in an entity   \nbut can exert significant influence over the  \nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair \nvalue by electing the fair value option       \navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant        \ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns \n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstancecommon stock. In certain cases, the  \nfirm applies the equity method of accounting  \nto new investments that are strategic in      \nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s       \nprincipal business activities, when the firm  \nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or   \nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less     \nsignificant. See Note 8 for further           \ninformation about equity-method investments.  \n                                          \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    6  \n                                          \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investment Funds. The firm has    \nformed investment funds with third-party      \ninvestors. These funds are typically organized\nas limited partnerships or limited liability  \ncompanies for which the firm acts as general  \npartner or manager. Generally, the firm does  \nnot hold a majority of the economic interests \nin these funds. These funds are usually voting\ninterest entities and generally are not       \nconsolidated because third-party investors    \ntypically have rights to terminate the funds  \nor to remove the firm as general partner or   \nmanager. Investments in these funds are       \ngenerally measured at net asset value (NAV)   \nand are included in investments. See Notes 8, \n18 and 22 for further information about       \ninvestments in funds. Use of Estimates        \nPreparation of these consolidated financial   \nstatements requires management to make certain\nestimates and assumptions, the most important \nof which relate to fair value measurements,   \nthe allowance for credit losses on loans and  \nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,    \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and accounting for income    \ntaxes. These estimates and assumptions are    \nbased on the best available information but   \nactual results could be materially different. \nRevenue Recognition Financial Assets and      \nLiabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and \nliabilities and certain investments are       \ncarried at fair value either under the fair   \nvalue option or in accordance with other U.S. \nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to    \naccount for certain of its loans and other    \nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nby electing the fair value option. The fair   \nvalue of a financial instrument is the amount \nthat would be received to sell an asset or    \npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly    \ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked \nto bid prices and financial liabilities are   \nmarked to offer prices. Fair value            \nmeasurements do not include transaction costs.\nFair value gains or losses are generally      \nincluded in market making or other principal  \ntransactions. See Note 4 for further          \ninformation about fair value measurements.    \nRevenue from Contracts with Clients. The firm \nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with \nclients for services, such as investment      \nbanking, investment management, and execution \nand clearing (contracts with clients), when   \nthe performance obligations related to the    \nunderlying transaction are completed. Revenues\nfrom contracts with clients represent         \napproximately 45% of total non-               \ninterestrevenues (including approximately 85% \nof investment banking revenues, approximately \n95% of investment management revenues and all \ncommissions and fees) for both the three and  \nsix months ended June 2022, and approximately \n40% of total non-interestrevenues (including  \napproximately 85% of investment banking       \nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment     \nmanagement revenues and all commissions and   \nfees) for both the three and six months ended \nJune 2021. See Note 25 for information about  \nnet revenues by business segment. Investment  \nBanking Advisory. Fees from financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues when   \nthe services related to the underlying        \ntransaction are completed under the terms of  \nthe assignment. Non-refundabledeposits and    \nmilestone payments in connection with         \nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized \nin revenues upon completion of the underlying \ntransaction or when the assignment is         \notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with \nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized \nwhen incurred and are included in transaction \nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such\nexpenses are included in investment banking   \nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon   \ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses      \nassociated with underwriting assignments are  \ngenerally deferred until the related revenue  \nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise  \nconcluded. Such expenses are included in      \ntransaction based expenses for completed      \nassignments.                                  \n                                          \n  7    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                          \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investment Management The firm    \nearns management fees and incentive fees for  \ninvestment management services, which are     \nincluded in investment management revenues.   \nThe firm makes payments to brokers and        \nadvisors related to the placement of the      \nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),  \nwhich are included in transaction based       \nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily net asset value and are received        \nmonthly. Management fees for hedge funds and  \nseparately managed accounts are calculated as \na percentage of month-endnet asset value and  \nare generally received quarterly. Management  \nfees for private equity funds are calculated  \nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are received quarterly, \nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the   \nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.      \nDistribution fees paid by the firm are        \ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net     \nasset value or the committed capital. Such    \nfees are included in transaction based        \nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are  \ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or     \nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other   \nperformance target. Incentive fees are        \ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a   \nfund. Fees that are based on performance over \na twelve-month period are subject to          \nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment \nperformance over the life of the fund, future \ninvestment underperformance may require fees  \npreviously distributed to the firm to be      \nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned   \nfrom a fund or separately managed account are \nrecognized when it is probable that a         \nsignificant reversal of such fees will not    \noccur, which is generally when such fees are  \nno longer subject to fluctuations in the      \nmarket value of investments held by the fund  \nor separately managed account. Therefore,     \nincentive fees recognized during the period   \nmay relate to performance obligations         \nsatisfied in previous periods. Commissions and\nFees The firm earns commissions and fees from \nexecuting and clearing client transactions on \nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter(OTC) transactions.           \nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides \nthird-party research services to clients in   \nconnection with certain soft-dollar           \narrangements. Third-party research costs      \nincurred by the firm in connection with such  \narrangements are presented net within         \ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance   \nObligations Remaining performance obligations \nare services that the firm has committed to   \nperform in the future in connection with its  \ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining  \nperformance obligations are generally related \nto its financial advisory assignments and     \ncertain investment management activities.     \nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory    \nassignments cannot be determined until the    \noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s    \ninvestment management activities, where fees  \nare calculated based on the net asset value of\nthe fund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining       \nperformance obligations cannot be determined  \nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in   \nthe market value of investments held by the   \nfund or separately managed account. The firm  \nis able to determine the future revenues      \nassociated with management fees calculated    \nbased on committed capital. As of June 2022,  \nsubstantially all future net revenues         \nassociated with such remaining performance    \nobligations will be recognized through 2029.  \nAnnual revenues associated with such          \nperformance obligations average less than $   \n250million through 2029. Transfers of         \nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has  \nrelinquished control over the assets          \ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses   \nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or     \nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s        \ncontinuing involvement with transferred       \nfinancial assets are initially recognized at  \nfair value. For transfers of financial assets \nthat are not accounted for as sales, the      \nassets are generally included in trading      \nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a \ncollateralized financing, with the related    \ninterest expense recognized over the life of  \nthe transaction.

The firm segregates cash for   \nregulatory and other purposes related to      \nclient activity. Cash and cash equivalents    \nsegregated for regulatory and other purposes  \nwere $ 26.86billion as of June 2022 and $     \n24.87billion as of December 2021. In addition,\nthe firm segregates securities for regulatory \nand other purposes related to client activity.\nSee Note 11 for further information about     \nsegregated securities. Customer and Other     \nReceivables Customer and other receivables    \nincluded receivables from customers and       \ncounterparties of $ 94.44billion as of June   \n2022 and $ 103.82billion as of December 2021, \nand receivables from brokers, dealers and     \nclearing organizations of $ 68.81billion as of\nJune 2022 and $ 56.85billion as of December   \n2021. Such receivables primarily consist of   \ncustomer margin loans, receivables resulting  \nfrom unsettled transactions and collateral    \nposted in connection with certain derivative  \ntransactions. Substantially all of these      \nreceivables are accounted for at amortized    \ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,  \nwhich generally approximates fair value. As   \nthese receivables are not accounted for at    \nfair value, they are not included in the      \nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through\n10. Had these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of   \nboth June 2022 and December 2021. See Note 10 \nfor further information about customer and    \nother receivables accounted for at fair value \nunder the fair value option. Interest on      \ncustomer and other receivables is recognized  \nover the life of the transaction and included \nin interest income. Customer and other        \nreceivables includes receivables from         \ncontracts with clients and contract assets.   \nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to \nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s    \nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n2.91billion as of June 2022 and $ 3.01billion \nas of December 2021. As of both June 2022 and \nDecember 2021 contract assets were not        \nmaterial. Customer and Other Payables Customer\nand other payables included payables to       \ncustomers and counterparties of $             \n259.48billion as of June 2022 and $           \n241.93billion as of December 2021, and        \npayables to brokers, dealers and clearing     \norganizations of $ 20.50billion as of June    \n2022 and $ 10.00billion as of December 2021.  \nSuch payables primarily consist of customer   \ncredit balances related to the firm\u2019s prime   \nbrokerage activities. Customer and other      \npayables are accounted for at cost plus       \naccrued interest, which generally approximates\nfair value. As these payables are not         \naccounted for at fair value, they are not     \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 through 10. Had these payables been   \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,  \nsubstantially all would have been classified  \nin level 2 as of both June 2022 and December  \n2021. Interest on customer and other payables \nis recognized over the life of the transaction\nand included in interest expense. Offsetting  \nAssets and Liabilities To reduce credit       \nexposures on derivatives and securities       \nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter    \ninto master netting agreements or similar     \narrangements (collectively, netting           \nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a      \ncontract with a counterparty that permits net \nsettlement of multiple transactions with that \ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of  \ntermination rights by a non-defaultingparty.  \nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all \ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is \ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with     \nrespect to its derivatives and securities     \nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms  \nof the related credit support agreements or   \nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit    \nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit    \nsupport agreement grants the non-             \ndefaultingparty exercising termination rights \nthe right to liquidate the collateral and     \napply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In    \norder to assess enforceability of the firm\u2019s  \nright of setoff under netting and credit      \nsupport agreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in   \nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the        \nagreement. Derivatives are reported on a net- \nby-counterpartybasis (i.e., the net payable or\nreceivable for derivative assets and          \nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the  \nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting \nagreement. Resale agreements and securities   \nsold under agreements to repurchase           \n(repurchase agreements) and securities        \nborrowed and loaned transactions with the same\nterm and currency are presented on a net-by-  \ncounterpartybasis in the consolidated balance \nsheets when such transactions meet certain    \nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements.                                   \n                                          \n  9    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                          \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and         \nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not       \nreported net of the related cash and          \nsecurities received or posted as collateral.  \nSee Note 11 for further information about     \ncollateral received and pledged, including    \nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See \nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about  \noffsetting assets and liabilities. Share-Based\nCompensation The cost of employee services    \nreceived in exchange for a share-based award  \nis generally measured based on the grant-date \nfair value of the award. Share-based awards   \nthat do not require future service (i.e.,     \nvested awards, including awards granted to    \nretirement-eligible employees) are expensed   \nimmediately. Share-based awards that require  \nfuture service are amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recorded when \nthey occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on \nrestricted stock units (RSUs) are generally   \ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that    \nrequire future service are forfeited, the     \nrelated dividend equivalents originally       \ncharged to retained earnings are reclassified \nto compensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues  \nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of   \nshare-based awards. In certain cases,         \nprimarily related to conflicted employment (as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements), \nthe firm may cash settle share-based          \ncompensation awards accounted for as equity   \ninstruments. For these awards, whose terms    \nallow for cash settlement, additional paid-   \nincapital is adjusted to the extent of the    \ndifference between the value of the award at  \nthe time of cash settlement and the grant-date\nvalue of the award. The tax effect related to \nthe settlement of share-based awards is       \nrecorded in income tax benefit or expense.    \nForeign Currency Translation Assets and       \nliabilities denominated in non-U.S.currencies \nare translated at rates of exchange prevailing\non the date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at   \naverage rates of exchange for the period.     \nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies   \nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a  \nnon-U.S.operation, when the functional        \ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are   \nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the     \nconsolidated statements of comprehensive      \nincome.

This ASU also requires  \nenhanced disclosure for loans that have been  \ncharged off. The ASU is effective in January  \n2023 under a prospective approach.

Fair Value Measurements   \nThe fair value of a financial instrument is   \nthe amount that would be received to sell an  \nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an   \norderly transaction between market            \nparticipants at the measurement date.         \nFinancial assets are marked to bid prices and \nfinancial liabilities are marked to offer     \nprices. Fair value measurements do not include\ntransaction costs. The firm measures certain  \nfinancial assets and liabilities as a         \nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to \nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active  \nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by    \nreference to prices for similar instruments,  \nquoted prices or recent transactions in less  \nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or            \nindependently sourced inputs, including, but  \nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities, \nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding  \nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference       \nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower \ncould finance a given financial instrument    \nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.  \nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for          \ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This   \nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation \ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving \nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based \non the lowest level of input that is          \nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In \nevaluating the significance of a valuation    \ninput, the firm considers, among other        \nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to   \nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as    \nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical, \nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.  \nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are       \nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values \nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial \nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain  \nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and      \nliabilities may require valuation adjustments \nthat a market participant would require to    \narrive at fair value for factors, such as     \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,   \nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments  \nare generally based on market evidence. The   \nvaluation techniques and nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair value of the\nfirm\u2019s financial instruments are described    \nbelow. See Notes 5 through 10 for further     \ninformation about significant unobservable    \ninputs used to value level 3 financial        \ninstruments. Valuation Techniques and         \nSignificant Inputs for Trading Cash           \nInstruments, Investments and Loans Level 1.   \nLevel 1 instruments include U.S. government   \nobligations, most non-U.S.government          \nobligations, certain agency obligations,      \ncertain corporate debt instruments, certain   \nmoney market instruments, certain other debt  \nobligations and actively traded listed        \nequities. These instruments are valued using  \nquoted prices for identical unrestricted      \ninstruments in active markets. The firm       \ndefines active markets for equity instruments \nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market  \ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm   \ndefines active markets for debt instruments   \nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity. \nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain  \nnon-U.S.government obligations, most agency   \nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and   \nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,  \nmost state and municipal obligations, most    \nmoney market instruments, most other debt     \nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed \nequities, certain private equities,           \ncommodities and certain lending commitments.  \nValuations of level 2 instruments can be      \nverified to quoted prices, recent trading     \nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative    \npricing sources with reasonable levels of     \nprice transparency. Consideration is given to \nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor executable) and the relationship of recent \nmarket activity to the prices provided from   \nalternative pricing sources. Valuation        \nadjustments are typically made to level 2     \ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject  \nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair   \nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally    \nbased on market evidence. Level 3.

Interest    \n       rate swaps and options denominated in  \n       the currencies of leading              \n       industrialized nations are             \n  \u2022    characterized by high trading volumes  \n       and tight bid/offer spreads. Interest  \n       rate derivatives that reference        \n       indices, such as an inflation index,   \n       or the shape of the yield curve        \n       (e.g.,10-yearswap rate vs.2-yearswap   \n       rate) are more complex, but the key    \n       inputs are generally observable.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit.Price transparency for credit   \n       default swaps, including both single   \n       names and baskets of credits, varies   \n       by market and underlying reference     \n       entity or obligation. Credit default   \n       swaps that reference indices, large    \n       corporates and major sovereigns        \n       generally exhibit the most price       \n       transparency. For credit default       \n       swaps with other underliers, price     \n       transparency varies based on credit    \n       rating, the cost of borrowing the      \n       underlying reference obligations, and  \n  \u2022    the availability of the underlying     \n       reference obligations for delivery     \n       upon the default of the issuer.        \n       Credit default swaps that reference    \n       loans, asset-backed securities and     \n       emerging market debt instruments tend  \n       to have less price transparency than   \n       those that reference corporate bonds.  \n       In addition, more complex credit       \n       derivatives, such as those sensitive   \n       to the correlation between two or      \n       more underlying reference              \n       obligations, generally have less       \n       price transparency.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Currency.Prices for currency           \n       derivatives based on the exchange      \n       rates of leading industrialized        \n       nations, including those with longer   \n       tenors, are generally transparent.     \n  \u2022    The primary difference between the     \n       price transparency of developed and    \n       emerging market currency derivatives   \n       is that emerging markets tend to be    \n       only observable for contracts with     \n       shorter tenors.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Commodity.Commodity derivatives        \n       include transactions referenced to     \n       energy (e.g., oil, natural gas and     \n       electricity), metals (e.g., precious   \n       and base) and soft commodities (e.g.,  \n       agricultural). Price transparency      \n       varies based on the underlying         \n  \u2022    commodity, delivery location, tenor    \n       and product quality (e.g., diesel      \n       fuel compared to unleaded gasoline).   \n       In general, price transparency for     \n       commodity derivatives is greater for   \n       contracts with shorter tenors and      \n       contracts that are more closely        \n       aligned with major and/or benchmark    \n       commodity indices.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Equity.Price transparency for equity   \n       derivatives varies by market and       \n       underlier. Options on indices and the  \n       common stock of corporates included    \n       in major equity indices exhibit the    \n       most price transparency. Equity        \n       derivatives generally have observable  \n  \u2022    market prices, except for contracts    \n       with long tenors or reference prices   \n       that differ significantly from         \n       current market prices. More complex    \n       equity derivatives, such as those      \n       sensitive to the correlation between   \n       two or more individual stocks,         \n       generally have less price              \n       transparency.                          \n                                              \nLiquidity is essential\nto observability of all\nproduct types.

In addition,    \n  \u2022    the valuation of certain structured    \n       trades requires the use of level\u00a03     \n       correlation inputs, such as the        \n       correlation of the price performance   \n       of two or more individual stocks or    \n       the correlation of the price           \n       performance for a basket of stocks to  \n       another asset class, such as           \n       commodities.                           \n                                              \nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level\n3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and\nlevel 2 inputs to reflect observable market   \nchanges and any resulting gains and losses are\nclassified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are     \nchanged when corroborated by evidence, such as\nsimilar market transactions, third-party      \npricing services and/or broker or dealer      \nquotations or other empirical market data. In \ncircumstances where the firm cannot verify the\nmodel value by reference to market            \ntransactions, it is possible that a different \nvaluation model could produce a materially    \ndifferent estimate of fair value. See Note 7  \nfor further information about significant     \nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of  \nlevel 3 derivatives. Valuation Adjustments.   \nValuation adjustments are integral to         \ndetermining the fair value of derivative      \nportfolios and are used to adjust the mid-    \nmarketvaluations produced by derivative       \npricing models to the exit price valuation.   \nThese adjustments incorporate bid/offer       \nspreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and\nfunding valuation adjustments, which account  \nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in   \nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative    \nportfolios. The firm also makes funding       \nvaluation adjustments to collateralized       \nderivatives where the terms of the agreement  \ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge \ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are  \ngenerally used when calibrating valuation     \nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In     \naddition, for derivatives that include        \nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm     \nmakes model or exit price adjustments to      \naccount for the valuation uncertainty present \nin the transaction.                           \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    14  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Such instruments include   \nresale and repurchase agreements; certain     \nsecurities borrowed and loaned transactions;  \ncertain customer and other receivables,       \nincluding certain margin loans; certain time  \ndeposits, including structured certificates of\ndeposit, which are hybrid financial           \ninstruments; substantially all other secured  \nfinancings, including transfers of assets     \naccounted for as financings; certain unsecured\nshort- and long-term borrowings, substantially\nall of which are hybrid financial instruments;\nand certain other liabilities. These          \ninstruments are generally valued based on     \ndiscounted cash flow techniques, which        \nincorporate inputs with reasonable levels of  \nprice transparency, and are generally         \nclassified in level 2 because the inputs are  \nobservable.

For example,  \n       the highest recovery rate for          \n       corporate debt instruments is          \n  \u2022    appropriate for valuing a specific     \n       corporate debt instrument, but may     \n       not be appropriate for valuing any     \n       other corporate debt instrument.       \n       Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do   \n       not represent uncertainty in, or       \n       possible ranges of, fair value         \n       measurements of level\u00a03 trading cash   \n       instruments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increases in yield, duration or        \n       cumulative loss rate used in the       \n       valuation of level 3 trading cash      \n       instruments would have resulted in a   \n       lower fair value measurement, while    \n       increases in recovery rate or          \n  \u2022    multiples would have resulted in a     \n       higher fair value measurement as of    \n       both June 2022 and December 2021. Due  \n       to the distinctive nature of each      \n       level 3 trading cash instrument, the   \n       interrelationship of inputs is not     \n       necessarily uniform within each        \n       product type.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Trading cash instruments are valued    \n       using discounted cash flows.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       In other, the significant              \n       unobservable inputs for multiples as   \n       of December 2021 did not have a range  \n  \u2022    (and there was no weighted average)    \n       as they pertained to a single          \n       position. Therefore, such              \n       unobservable inputs are not included   \n       in the table above.                    \n                                              \nLevel 3 Rollforward                           \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level\u00a03\ntrading cash\ninstruments.\n                                              \n           T\u2026                S\u2026               \n           M\u2026                M\u2026               \n           E\u2026                E\u2026               \n           J\u2026                J\u2026               \n  $                                           \n  \u2026        2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026     \n  \u2026                                           \n     T\u2026                                       \n     t\u2026                                       \n     c\u2026                                       \n     i\u2026                                       \n     a\u2026                                       \n  \u2026        $\u2026       $\u2026       $\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        27       23       44        42     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        (\u2026  )    10       (\u2026  )     16     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        3\u2026       2\u2026       1\u2026       647     \n  \u2026        (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (4\u2026  )  \n  \u2026        (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (2\u2026  )  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        4\u2026       1\u2026       1\u2026       181     \n  \u2026                                           \n  3                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (2\u2026  )  \n  \u2026                                           \n  3                                           \n  \u2026        $\u2026       $\u2026       $\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                           \n     T\u2026                                       \n     t\u2026                                       \n     c\u2026                                       \n     i\u2026                                       \n     l\u2026                                       \n  \u2026        $\u2026  )     $  )    $\u2026  )      $  )  \n  \u2026                 (\u2026                (80     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        (\u2026  )     2       (\u2026  )      4     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        (\u2026  )    (2  )    (\u2026  )      \u2013     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        72       35       1\u2026        28     \n  \u2026        (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (39  )  \n  \u2026         2       20        3        10     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        (\u2026  )    (5  )    (\u2026  )     (4  )  \n  \u2026                                           \n  3                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        11        5       12         3     \n  \u2026                                           \n  3                                           \n  \u2026        $\u2026  )     $  )    $\u2026  )      $  )  \n  \u2026                 (\u2026                (78     \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       Changes in fair value are presented    \n  \u2022    for all trading cash instruments that  \n       are classified in level\u00a03 as of the    \n       end of the period.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates  \n  \u2022    to trading cash instruments that were  \n       still held atperiod-end.               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Transfers between levels of the fair   \n       value hierarchy are reported at the    \n       beginning of the reporting period in   \n  \u2022    which they occur.

Note 7.   \nDerivatives and Hedging Activities Derivative \nActivities Derivatives are instruments that   \nderive their value from underlying asset      \nprices, indices, reference rates and other    \ninputs, or a combination of these factors.    \nDerivatives may be traded on an exchange      \n(exchange-traded) or they may be privately    \nnegotiated contracts, which are usually       \nreferred to as OTC derivatives. Certain of the\nfirm\u2019s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled\nthrough central clearing counterparties (OTC- \ncleared),while others are bilateral contracts \nbetween two counterparties (bilateral OTC).   \nMarket Making. As a market maker, the firm    \nenters into derivative transactions to provide\nliquidity to clients and to facilitate the    \ntransfer and hedging of their risks. In this  \nrole, the firm typically acts as principal and\nis required to commit capital to provide      \nexecution, and maintains market-making        \npositions in response to, or in anticipation  \nof, client demand.                            \nRisk Management. The\nfirm also enters into\nderivatives to actively\nmanage risk exposures\nthat arise from its\nmarket-making and\ninvesting and financing\nactivities. The firm\u2019s\nholdings and exposures\nare hedged, in many\ncases, on either a\nportfolio or risk-\nspecific basis, as\nopposed to an\ninstrument-by-\ninstrumentbasis. The\noffsetting impact of\nthis economic hedging\nis reflected in the\nsame business segment\nas the related\nrevenues. In addition,\nthe firm may enter into\nderivatives designated\nas hedges under U.S.\nGAAP. These derivatives\nare used to manage\ninterest rate exposure\nof certain fixed-rate\nunsecured borrowings\nand deposits and\ncertain U.S. government\nsecurities classified\nas available-for-sale,\nforeign exchange risk\nof certain available-\nfor-salesecurities and\nthe net investment in\ncertain\nnon-U.S.operations, and\nthe price risk of\ncertain commodities.\n\nThe firm enters into\nvarious types of\nderivatives, including:\n                                              \n       Futures and Forwards.Contracts that    \n       commit counterparties to purchase or   \n  \u2022    sell financial instruments,            \n       commodities or currencies in the       \n       future.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Swaps.Contracts that require           \n       counterparties to exchange cash        \n       flows, such as currency or interest    \n       payment streams. The amounts           \n  \u2022    exchanged are based on the specific    \n       terms of the contract with reference   \n       to specified rates, financial          \n       instruments, commodities, currencies   \n       or indices.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Options.Contracts in which the option  \n       purchaser has the right, but not the   \n       obligation, to purchase from or sell   \n  \u2022    to the option writer financial         \n       instruments, commodities or            \n       currencies within a defined time       \n       period for a specified price.          \n                                              \nDerivatives are\nreported on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for\nderivative assets and\nliabilities for a given\ncounterparty) when a\nlegal right of setoff\nexists under an\nenforceable netting\nagreement (counterparty\nnetting).

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) The net unrealized gains on level \n3 derivatives for the three months ended June \n2022 were primarily attributable to gains on  \ncertain commodity derivatives (primarily      \nreflecting the impact of an increase in       \ncommodity prices), gains on certain equity    \nderivatives (primarily reflecting the impact  \nof a decrease in equity prices), and gains on \ncertain credit derivatives and interest rate  \nderivatives (in each case, primarily          \nreflecting the impact of an increase in       \ninterest rates). Transfers into level 3       \nderivatives during the three months ended June\n2022 primarily reflected transfers of certain \ncommodity derivative assets from level 2      \n(principally due to decreased transparency of \ncertain electricity price inputs used to value\nthese derivatives), partially offset by       \ntransfers of certain currency derivative      \nliabilities from level 2 (principally due to  \ndecreased transparency of certain interest    \nrate inputs used to value these derivatives). \nTransfers out of level 3 derivatives during   \nthe three months ended June 2022primarily     \nreflected transfers of certain commodity      \nderivative assets to level 2 (principally due \nto certain correlation inputs no longer being \nsignificant to the valuation of these         \nderivatives), partially offset by transfers of\ncertain interest rate derivative liabilities  \nto level 2 (principally due to increased      \ntransparency of certain unobservable          \nvolatility inputs used to value these         \nderivatives). Six Months Ended June 2022. The \nnet realized and unrealized gains on level 3  \nderivatives of $ 3.55billion (reflecting $    \n329million of net realized gains and $        \n3.23billion of net unrealized gains) for the  \nsix months ended June 2022 included gains of $\n3.55billion reported in market making and     \ngains of $ 8million reported in other         \nprincipal transactions. The net unrealized    \ngains on level 3 derivatives for the six      \nmonths ended June 2022 were primarily         \nattributable to gains on certain commodity    \nderivatives (primarily reflecting the impact  \nof an increase in commodity prices), gains on \ncertain equity derivatives (primarily         \nreflecting the impact of a decrease in equity \nprices), and gains on certain interest rate   \nderivatives and credit derivatives ( in each  \ncase,primarily reflecting the impact of an    \nincrease in interest rates). Transfers into   \nlevel 3 derivatives during the six months     \nended June 2022 primarily reflected transfers \nof certain commodity derivative assets from   \nlevel 2 (principally due to decreased         \ntransparency of certain electricity price     \ninputs used to value these derivatives),      \npartially offset by transfers of certain      \ncurrency derivative liabilities from level 2  \n(principally due to decreased transparency of \ncertain interest rate inputs used to value    \nthese derivatives). Transfers out of level 3  \nderivatives during the six months ended June  \n2022 primarily reflected transfers of certain \ncommodity derivative assets to level 2        \n(principally due to certain correlation inputs\nno longer being significant to the valuation  \nof these derivatives) and transfers of certain\ninterest rate derivative assets to level 2    \n(principally due to increased transparency of \ncertain unobservable volatility inputs used to\nvalue these derivatives), partially offset by \ntransfers of certain equity derivative        \nliabilities to level 2 (principally due to    \nincreased transparency of certain unobservable\nvolatility inputs used to value these         \nderivatives).

If there   \n       is no credit event, as defined in the  \n       contract, the seller of protection     \n       makes no payments to the buyer. If a   \n       credit event occurs, the seller of     \n       protection is required to make a       \n       payment to the buyer, calculated       \n       according to the terms of the          \n       contract.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit Options.In a credit option,     \n       the option writer assumes the          \n       obligation to purchase or sell a       \n       reference obligation at a specified    \n       price or credit spread. The option     \n       purchaser buys the right, but does     \n  \u2022    not assume the obligation, to sell     \n       the reference obligation to, or        \n       purchase it from, the option writer.   \n       The payments on credit options depend  \n       either on a particular credit spread   \n       or the price of the reference          \n       obligation.                            \n                                              \n                                         \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q  26  \n                                         \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited)                                   \n                                              \n       Credit Indices, Baskets and            \n       Tranches.Credit derivatives may        \n       reference a basket of single-name      \n       credit default swaps or a broad-based  \n       index. If a credit event occurs in     \n       one of the underlying reference        \n       obligations, the protection seller     \n       pays the protection buyer. The         \n       payment is typically apro-rataportion  \n       of the transaction\u2019s total notional    \n  \u2022    amount based on the underlying         \n       defaulted reference obligation. In     \n       certain transactions, the credit risk  \n       of a basket or index is separated      \n       into various portions (tranches),      \n       each having different levels of        \n       subordination. The most junior         \n       tranches cover initial defaults and    \n       once losses exceed the notional        \n       amount of these junior tranches, any   \n       excess loss is covered by the next     \n       most senior tranche.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Total Return Swaps.A total return      \n       swap transfers the risks relating to   \n       economic performance of a reference    \n       obligation from the protection buyer   \n       to the protection seller. Typically,   \n       the protection buyer receives a        \n  \u2022    floating rate of interest and          \n       protection against any reduction in    \n       fair value of the reference            \n       obligation, and the protection seller  \n       receives the cash flows associated     \n       with the reference obligation, plus    \n       any increase in the fair value of the  \n       reference obligation.                  \n                                              \nThe firm economically\nhedges its exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a\nparticular written\ncredit derivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default.\n\nAs of June\u00a02022,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $ 491.06\nbillion and purchased\ncredit derivatives had\na total gross notional\namount of $ 541.22\nbillion, for total net\nnotional purchased\nprotection of $ 50.16\nbillion.

The firm designates foreign  \nexchange forward contracts as fair value      \nhedges of the foreign exchange risk of        \nnon-U.S.government securities classified as   \navailable-for-sale.See Note 8 for information \nabout the amortized cost and fair value of    \nsuch securities. The effectiveness of such    \nhedges is assessed based on changes in spot   \nrates. The gains/(losses) on the hedges       \n(relating to both spot and forward points) and\nthe foreign exchange gains/(losses) on the    \nrelated available-for-salesecurities are      \nincluded in market making. The net            \ngains/(losses) on hedges and related          \navailable-for-sale securities were $( 14)     \nmillion (reflecting a gain of $ 183million    \nrelated to hedges and a loss of $ 197million  \non the related hedged available-for-sale      \nsecurities) for the three months ended June   \n2022 and were $( 28) million (reflecting a    \ngain of $ 236million related to hedges and a  \nloss of $ 264million on the related hedged    \navailable-for-sale securities) for the six    \nmonths ended June 2022. The gross and net     \ngains/(losses) were not material for both the \nthree and six months ended June 2021. The firm\ndesignates commodity futures contracts as fair\nvalue hedges of the price risk of certain     \nprecious metals included in commodities within\ntrading assets. As of June 2022, there were no\nsuch hedges outstanding, and as of December   \n2021, the carrying value of commodities in a  \nhedging relationship was $ 1.05billion and the\namortized cost was $ 1.02billion. Changes in  \nspot rates of such commodities are reflected  \nas an adjustment to their carrying value, and \nthe related gains/(losses) on both the        \ncommodities and the designated futures        \ncontracts are included in market making. The  \ncontractual forward points on the designated  \nfutures contracts are amortized into earnings \nratably over the life of the contract and     \nother gains/(losses) as a result of changes in\nthe forward points are included in other      \ncomprehensive income/(loss). The cumulative   \nhedging adjustment was not material as of both\nJune 2022 and December 2021, and the related  \ngains/(losses) were not material for each of  \nthe three and six months ended June 2022 and  \nJune 2021. Net Investment Hedges The firm     \nseeks to reduce the impact of fluctuations in \nforeign exchange rates on its net investments \nin certain non-U.S.operations through the use \nof foreign currency forward contracts and     \nforeign currency-denominated debt. For foreign\ncurrency forward contracts designated as      \nhedges, the effectiveness of the hedge is     \nassessed based on the overall changes in the  \nfair value of the forward contracts (i.e.,    \nbased on changes in forward rates). For       \nforeign currency-denominated debt designated  \nas a hedge, the effectiveness of the hedge is \nassessed based on changes in spot rates. For  \nqualifying net investment hedges, all gains or\nlosses on the hedging instruments are included\nin currency translation.                      \n                                           \n  29    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investments in Funds at Net Asset \nValue Per Share. Equity securities and debt   \ninstruments, at fair value include investments\nin funds that are measured at NAV of the      \ninvestment fund. The firm uses NAV to measure \nthe fair value of fund investments when (i)   \nthe fund investment does not have a readily   \ndeterminable fair value and (ii) the NAV of   \nthe investment fund is calculated in a manner \nconsistent with the measurement principles of \ninvestment company accounting, including      \nmeasurement of the investments at fair value. \nSubstantially all of the firm\u2019s investments in\nfunds at NAV consist of investments in firm-  \nsponsored private equity, credit, real estate \nand hedge funds where the firm co-investswith \nthird-party investors. Private equity funds   \nprimarily invest in a broad range of          \nindustries worldwide, including leveraged     \nbuyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments\nand distressed investments. Credit funds      \ngenerally invest in loans and other fixed     \nincome instruments and are focused on         \nproviding private high-yield capital for      \nleveraged and management buyout transactions, \nrecapitalizations, financings, refinancings,  \nacquisitions and restructurings for private   \nequity firms, private family companies and    \ncorporate issuers. Real estate funds invest   \nglobally, primarily in real estate companies, \nloan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and   \nproperty. Private equity, credit and real     \nestate funds are closed-endfunds in which the \nfirm\u2019s investments are generally not eligible \nfor redemption. Distributions will be received\nfrom these funds as the underlying assets are \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. The firm also invests in hedge  \nfunds, primarily multi-disciplinary hedge     \nfunds that employ a fundamental bottom-       \nupinvestment approach across various asset    \nclasses and strategies. The firm\u2019s investments\nin hedge funds primarily include interests    \nwhere the underlying assets are illiquid in   \nnature, and proceeds from redemptions will not\nbe received until the underlying assets are   \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain.                                 \nPrivate equity and\nhedge funds, in which\nthe firm is invested,\ninclude \u201ccovered funds\u201d\nas defined in the\nVolcker Rule of the\nU.S. Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act\n(Dodd-Frank Act).\nSubstantially all of\nthe credit and real\nestate funds, in which\nthe firm is invested,\nare not covered funds.\nThe Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB) extended\nthe conformance period\nto July\u00a02022 for the\nfirm\u2019s investments in,\nand relationships with,\ncertain legacy\n\u201cilliquid funds\u201d (as\ndefined in the Volcker\nRule) that were in\nplace prior to\nDecember\u00a02013.

Due  \n       to the distinctive nature of each      \n       level\u00a03 investment, the                \n       interrelationship of inputs is not     \n       necessarily uniform within each        \n       product type.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Corporate debt securities, securities  \n       backed by real estate and other debt   \n       obligations are valued using           \n  \u2022    discounted cash flows, and equity      \n       securities are valued using market     \n       comparables and discounted cash        \n       flows.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       The fair value of any one instrument   \n       may be determined using multiple       \n       valuation techniques. For example,     \n  \u2022    market comparables and discounted      \n       cash flows may be used together to     \n       determine fair value. Therefore, the   \n       level\u00a03 balance encompasses both of    \n       these techniques.                      \n                                              \nLevel 3 Rollforward                           \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level\u00a03\ninvestments.\n                                              \n        Th\u2026                 Six               \n        Mo\u2026                 Mo\u2026               \n        En\u2026                 En\u2026               \n        Ju\u2026                 Ju\u2026               \n  $                                           \n  in    20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026     \n  m\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026    $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026    144        85       309       245     \n  g\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  u\u2026    (5\u2026  )    1,\u2026       (1\u2026  )    1,\u2026     \n  g\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    425       558       815       971     \n  S\u2026    (2\u2026  )    (4\u2026  )    (4\u2026  )    (7\u2026  )  \n  S\u2026    (5\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )  \n  T\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026    3,\u2026       873       5,\u2026       1,\u2026     \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  T\u2026                                          \n  o\u2026                                          \n  of    (7\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (2\u2026  )  \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  E\u2026    $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       Changes in fair value are presented    \n  \u2022    for all investments that are           \n       classified in level\u00a03 as of the end    \n       of the period.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates  \n  \u2022    to investments that were still held    \n       atperiod-end.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Transfers between levels of the fair   \n       value hierarchy are reported at the    \n       beginning of the reporting period in   \n  \u2022    which they occur.

At that\ntime, all accrued but\nuncollected interest is\nreversed against\ninterest income and\ninterest subsequently\ncollected is recognized\non a cash basis to the\nextent the loan balance\nis deemed collectible.\nOtherwise, all cash\nreceived is used to\nreduce the outstanding\nloan balance. A loan is\nconsidered past due\nwhen a principal or\ninterest payment has\nnot been made according\nto its contractual\nterms. Credit card\nloans are not placed on\nnonaccrual status and\naccrue interest until\nthe loan is paid in\nfull or is charged off.\n\nIn certain\ncircumstances, the firm\nmay modify the original\nterms of a loan\nagreement by granting a\nconcession to a\nborrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty,\ntypically in the form\nof a modification of\nloan covenants, but may\nalso include\nforbearance of interest\nor principal, payment\nextensions or interest\nrate reductions. These\nmodifications, to the\nextent significant, are\nconsidered TDRs.

To determine the \nallowance for credit losses, the firm         \nclassifies its loans and lending commitments  \naccounted for at amortized cost into wholesale\nand consumer portfolios. These portfolios     \nrepresent the level at which the firm has     \ndeveloped and documented its methodology to   \ndetermine the allowance for credit losses. The\nallowance for credit losses is measured on a  \ncollective basis for loans that exhibit       \nsimilar risk characteristics using a modeled  \napproach and on an asset-specific basis for   \nloans that do not share similar risk          \ncharacteristics. The allowance for credit     \nlosses takes into account the weighted average\nof a range of forecasts of future economic    \nconditions over the expected life of the loan \nand lending commitments. The expected life of \neach loan or lending commitment is determined \nbased on the contractual term adjusted for    \nextension options or demand features, or is   \nmodeled in the case of revolving credit card  \nloans. The forecasts include baseline,        \nfavorable and adverse economic scenarios over \na three-year period. For loans with expected  \nlives beyond three years, the model reverts to\nhistorical loss information based on a non-   \nlinearmodeled approach. The forecasted        \neconomic scenarios consider a number of risk  \nfactors relevant to the wholesale and consumer\nportfolios described below.

The allowance   \nfor credit losses for wholesale loans and     \nlending commitments that exhibit similar risk \ncharacteristics is measured using a modeled   \napproach. These models determine the          \nprobability of default and loss given default \nbased on various risk factors, including      \ninternal credit ratings, industry default and \nloss data, expected life, macroeconomic       \nindicators, the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet   \nits financial obligations, the borrower\u2019s     \ncountry of risk and industry, loan seniority  \nand collateral type. For lending commitments, \nthe methodology also considers probability of \ndrawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans  \nbacked by real estate, risk factors include   \nthe loan-to-valueratio, debt service ratio and\nhome price index. The most significant inputs \nto the forecast model for wholesale loans and \nlending commitments include unemployment      \nrates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and    \nindustrial delinquency rates, short- and long-\nterm interest rates, and oil prices. The      \nallowance for loan losses for wholesale loans \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics, such as nonaccrual loans or  \nloans in a TDR, is calculated using the       \npresent value of expected future cash flows   \ndiscounted at the loan\u2019s original effective   \nrate, the observable market price of the loan \nor the fair value of the collateral. Wholesale\nloans are charged off against the allowance   \nfor loan losses when deemed to be             \nuncollectible. Consumer. The allowance for    \ncredit losses for consumer loans thatexhibit  \nsimilar risk characteristics is calculated    \nusing a modeled approach which classifies     \nconsumer loans into pools based on borrower-  \nrelated and exposure-related characteristics  \nthat differentiate a pool\u2019s risk              \ncharacteristics from other pools. The factors \nconsidered in determining a pool are generally\nconsistent with the risk characteristics used \nfor internal credit risk measurement and      \nmanagement and include key metrics, such as   \nFICO credit scores, delinquency status, loan  \nvintage and macroeconomic indicators. The most\nsignificant inputs to the forecast model for  \nconsumer loans include unemployment rates and \ndelinquency rates. The expected life of       \nrevolving credit card loans is determined by  \nmodeling expected future draws and the timing \nand amount of repayments allocated to the     \nfunded balance. The firm also recognizes an   \nallowance for credit losses on commitments to \nacquire loans. However, no allowance for      \ncredit losses is recognized on credit card    \nlending commitments as they are cancellable by\nthe firm. The allowance for credit losses for \nconsumer loans that do not share similar risk \ncharacteristics, such as loans in a TDR, is   \ncalculated using the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s    \noriginal effective rate. Installment loans are\ncharged off when they are 120 days past due.  \nCredit card loans are charged off when they   \nare 180 days past due.                        \n                                           \n  41    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Due  \n       to the distinctive nature of each      \n       level\u00a03 loan, the interrelationship    \n       of inputs is not necessarily uniform   \n       within each product type.              \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Loans are valued using discounted      \n       cash flows.                            \n                                              \nLevel 3 Rollforward                           \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level\u00a03\nloans.\n                                              \n        Th\u2026                 Six               \n        Mo\u2026                 Mo\u2026               \n        En\u2026                 En\u2026               \n        Ju\u2026                 Ju\u2026               \n  $                                           \n  in    20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026     \n  m\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026    $2\u2026       $2\u2026       $2\u2026       $2\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026     27        21        76        47     \n  g\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  u\u2026    (67  )     22       (1\u2026  )    (11  )  \n  g\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    131        35       241        68     \n  S\u2026    (42  )      \u2013       (41  )      \u2013     \n  S\u2026    (1\u2026  )    (2\u2026  )    (3\u2026  )    (3\u2026  )  \n  T\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026     89        51       211        94     \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  T\u2026                                          \n  o\u2026                                          \n  of    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (61  )    (2\u2026  )  \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  E\u2026    $2\u2026       $2\u2026       $2\u2026       $2\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       Changes in fair value are presented    \n  \u2022    for loans that are classified in       \n       level\u00a03 as of the end of the period.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates  \n  \u2022    to loans that were still held          \n       atperiod-end.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Purchases includes originations and    \n       secondary purchases.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Transfers between levels of the fair   \n       value hierarchy are reported at the    \n       beginning of the reporting period in   \n  \u2022    which they occur.

See\nNote\u00a018 for further\ninformation about\nlending commitments.\n\nImpact of Credit\nSpreads on Loans and\nLending Commitments\n\nThe estimated net\ngain/(loss)\nattributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads on loans and\nlending commitments\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected was $( 105\n)\u00a0million for the\nthree months ended\nJune\u00a02022, $ 71\nmillion for the three\nmonths ended\nJune\u00a02021, $( 107\n)\u00a0million for the six\nmonths ended June\u00a02022\nand $ 203 million for\nthe six months ended\nJune\u00a02021. The firm\ngenerally calculates\nthe fair value of\nloans and lending\ncommitments for which\nthe fair value option\nis elected by\ndiscounting future\ncash flows at a rate\nwhich incorporates the\ninstrument-specific\ncredit spreads. For\nfloating-rate loans\nand lending\ncommitments,\nsubstantially all\nchanges in fair value\nare attributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads, whereas for\nfixed-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nchanges in fair value\nare also attributable\nto changes in interest\nrates.\nNote 11. Collateralized Agreements and        \nFinancings Collateralized agreements are      \nresale agreements and securities borrowed.    \nCollateralized financings are repurchase      \nagreements, securities loaned and other       \nsecured financings. The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things, \nfacilitate client activities, invest excess   \ncash, acquire securities to cover short       \npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings are  \npresented on a net-by-counterpartybasis when a\nlegal right of setoff exists. Interest on     \ncollateralized agreements, which is included  \nin interest income, and collateralized        \nfinancings, which is included in interest     \nexpense, is recognized over the life of the   \ntransaction. See Note 23 for further          \ninformation about interest income and interest\nexpense. Resale and Repurchase Agreements A   \nresale agreement is a transaction in which the\nfirm purchases financial instruments from a   \nseller, typically in exchange for cash, and   \nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to    \nresell the same or substantially the same     \nfinancial instruments to the seller at a      \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. A repurchase agreement is a transaction \nin which the firm sells financial instruments \nto a buyer, typically in exchange for cash,   \nand simultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same \nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a     \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale       \nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d)involve the legal transfer of       \nownership of financial instruments, they are  \naccounted for as financing arrangements       \nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the  \nmaturity of the agreement. The financial      \ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and   \nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.  \ngovernment and agency, and investment-grade   \nsovereign obligations.

When        \nassessing goodwill for impairment, first, a   \nqualitative assessment can be made to         \ndetermine whether it is more likely than not  \nthat the estimated fair value of a reporting  \nunit is less than its estimated carrying      \nvalue. If the results of the qualitative      \nassessment are not conclusive, a quantitative \ngoodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a  \nquantitative goodwill test can be performed   \nwithout performing a qualitative assessment.  \nThe quantitative goodwill test compares the   \nestimated fair value of each reporting unit   \nwith its estimated net book value (including  \ngoodwill and identifiable intangible assets). \nIf the reporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value  \nexceeds its estimated net book value, goodwill\nis not impaired. An impairment is recognized  \nif the estimated fair value of a reporting    \nunit is less than its estimated net book      \nvalue. To estimate the fair value of each     \nreporting unit, other than Consumer banking, a\nrelative value technique is used because the  \nfirm believes market participants would use   \nthis technique to value these reporting units.\nThe relative value technique applies          \nobservable price-to-earningsmultiples or      \nprice-to-bookmultiples of comparable          \ncompetitors to reporting units\u2019 net earnings  \nor net book value. To estimate the fair value \nof Consumer banking, a discounted cash flow   \nvaluation approach is used because the firm   \nbelieves market participants would use this   \ntechnique to value that reporting unit given  \nits early stage of development. The estimated \nnet carrying value of each reporting unit     \nreflects an allocation of total shareholders\u2019 \nequity and represents the estimated amount of \ntotal shareholders\u2019 equity required to support\nthe activities of the reporting unit under    \ncurrently applicable regulatory capital       \nrequirements. In the fourth quarter of 2021,  \nthe firm performed its annual assessment of   \ngoodwill for impairment, for each of its      \nreporting units, by performing a qualitative  \nassessment. Multiple factors, including       \nperformance indicators, macroeconomic         \nindicators, firm and industry events, and fair\nvalue indicators, were assessed with respect  \nto each of the firm\u2019s reporting units to      \ndetermine whether it was more likely than not \nthat the estimated fair value of any of those \nreporting units was less than its estimated   \ncarrying value. The qualitative assessment    \nalso considered changes since a quantitative  \ntest was last performed in 2019.              \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    56  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The Trust is a wholly-owned     \nfinance subsidiary of the firm for regulatory \nand legal purposes but is not consolidated for\naccounting purposes. The firm pays interest   \nsemi-annually on the junior subordinated debt \nat an annual rate of 6.345% and the debt      \nmatures on February 15, 2034. The coupon rate \nand the payment dates applicable to the       \nbeneficial interests are the same as the      \ninterest rate and payment dates for the junior\nsubordinated debt.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) The firm reassesses its evaluation\nof whether an entity is a VIE when certain    \nreconsideration events occur. The firm        \nreassesses its determination of whether it is \nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and              \ncircumstances. VIE Activities The firm is     \nprincipally involved with VIEs through the    \nfollowing business activities: Mortgage-Backed\nVIEs. The firm sells residential and          \ncommercial mortgage loans and securities to   \nmortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial\ninterests in the assets sold to these VIEs.   \nThe firm purchases and sells beneficial       \ninterests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in   \nconnection with market-making activities. In  \naddition, the firm may enter into derivatives \nwith certain of these VIEs, primarily interest\nrate swaps, which are typically not variable  \ninterests. The firm generally enters into     \nderivatives with other counterparties to      \nmitigate its risk. Real Estate, Credit- and   \nPower-Related and Other Investing VIEs. The   \nfirm purchases equity and debt securities     \nissued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold   \nreal estate, performing and nonperforming     \ndebt, distressed loans, power-related assets  \nand equity securities. The firm generally does\nnot sell assets to, or enter into derivatives \nwith, these VIEs. Corporate Debt and Other    \nAsset-Backed VIEs. The firm structures VIEs   \nthat issue notes to clients, purchases and    \nsells beneficial interests issued by corporate\ndebt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection\nwith market-making activities, and makes loans\nto VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain\nof these VIEs synthetically create the        \nexposure for the beneficial interests they    \nissue by entering into credit derivatives with\nthe firm, rather than purchasing the          \nunderlying assets. In addition, the firm may  \nenter into derivatives, such as total return  \nswaps, with certain corporate debt and other  \nasset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays  \nthe VIE a return due to the beneficial        \ninterest holders and receives the return on   \nthe collateral owned by the VIE. The          \ncollateral owned by these VIEs is primarily   \nother asset-backed loans and securities. The  \nfirm may be removed as the total return swap  \ncounterparty and may enter into derivatives   \nwith other counterparties to mitigate its risk\nrelated to these swaps. The firm may sell     \nassets to the corporate debt and other asset- \nbacked VIEs it structures.                    \nPrincipal-Protected\nNote VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs own\nportfolios of assets,\nprincipally with\nexposure to hedge\nfunds.

The firm enters into   \nvarious derivatives that meet the definition  \nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including     \nwritten equity and commodity put options,     \nwritten currency contracts and interest rate  \ncaps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives \nare risk managed together with derivatives    \nthat do not meet the definition of a          \nguarantee, and therefore the amounts in the   \ntable above do not reflect the firm\u2019s overall \nrisk related to derivative activities.        \nDisclosures about derivatives are not required\nif they may be cash settled and the firm has  \nno basis to conclude it is probable that the  \ncounterparties held the underlying instruments\nat inception of the contract. The firm has    \nconcluded that these conditions have been met \nfor certain large, internationally active     \ncommercial and investment bank counterparties,\ncentral clearing counterparties, hedge funds  \nand certain other counterparties. Accordingly,\nthe firm has not included such contracts in   \nthe table above. See Note 7 for information   \nabout credit derivatives that meet the        \ndefinition of a guarantee, which are not      \nincluded in the table above. Derivatives are  \naccounted for at fair value and therefore the \ncarrying value is considered the best         \nindication of payment/performance risk for    \nindividual contracts. However, the carrying   \nvalues in the table above exclude the effect  \nof counterparty and cash collateral netting.  \nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees.   \nSecurities lending and clearing guarantees    \ninclude the indemnifications and guarantees   \nthat the firm provides in its capacity as an  \nagency lender and in its capacity as a        \nsponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. As an agency lender, the firm    \nindemnifies most of its securities lending    \ncustomers against losses incurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not return securities and   \nthe collateral held is insufficient to cover  \nthe market value of the securities borrowed.  \nThe maximum payout of such indemnifications   \nwas $ 12.26billion as of June 2022 and $      \n11.05billion as of December 2021. Collateral  \nheld by the lenders in connection with        \nsecurities lending indemnifications was $     \n12.83billion as of June 2022 and $            \n11.36billion as of December 2021. Because the \ncontractual nature of these arrangements      \nrequires the firm to obtain collateral with a \nmarket value that exceeds the value of the    \nsecurities lent to the borrower, there is     \nminimal performance risk associated with these\nindemnifications. As a sponsoring member of   \nthe Government Securities Division of the     \nFixed Income Clearing Corporation, the firm   \nguarantees the performance of its sponsored   \nmember clients to the Fixed Income Clearing   \nCorporation in connection with certain resale \nand repurchase agreements. To minimize        \npotential losses on such guarantees, the firm \nobtains a security interest in the collateral \nthat the sponsored client placed with the     \nFixed Income Clearing Corporation. Therefore, \nthe risk of loss on such guarantees is        \nminimal. There were no amounts outstanding    \nunder the guarantee as of both June 2022 and  \nDecember 2021.                                \n                                           \n  69    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Other Financial Guarantees. In the\nordinary course of business, the firm provides\nother financial guarantees of the obligations \nof third parties (e.g., standby letters of    \ncredit and other guarantees to enable clients \nto complete transactions and fund-related     \nguarantees). These guarantees represent       \nobligations to make payments to beneficiaries \nif the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its  \nobligation under a contractual arrangement    \nwith that beneficiary. Other financial        \nguarantees also include a guarantee that the  \nfirm has provided to the Government of        \nMalaysia that it will receive at least $      \n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets \nseized by governmental authorities around the \nworld related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad,\na sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB).   \nThe firm evaluates progress toward satisfying \nthis obligation based on the report that it   \nreceives on a semi-annual basis, expected in  \nFebruary and August. Based on the latest      \nreport as of February 2022, approximately $   \n450million in assets and proceeds from assets \nhas been returned to the Government of        \nMalaysia in connection with this guarantee,   \nwhich must be satisfied by August 2025. Any   \namounts paid by the firm under this guarantee \nwould be subject to reimbursement in the event\nthe assets and proceeds received by the       \nGovernment of Malaysia through August 18, 2028\nexceed $ 1.4billion. See Note 27 for further  \ninformation about matters related to 1MDB.    \nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The\nfirm has established trusts, including Goldman\nSachs Capital I, the APEX Trusts and other    \nentities, for the limited purpose of issuing  \nsecurities to third parties, lending the      \nproceeds to the firm and entering into        \ncontractual arrangements with the firm and    \nthird parties related to this purpose. The    \nfirm does not consolidate these entities. See \nNote 14 for further information about the     \ntransactions involving Goldman Sachs Capital I\nand the APEX Trusts. The firm effectively     \nprovides for the full and unconditional       \nguarantee of the securities issued by these   \nentities. Timely payment by the firm of       \namounts due to these entities under the       \nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and     \nrelated contractual arrangements will be      \nsufficient to cover payments due on the       \nsecurities issued by these entities. No       \nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the       \nsecurities of Goldman Sachs Capital I or the  \nAPEX Trusts. Management believes that it is   \nunlikely that any circumstances will occur,   \nsuch as nonperformance on the part of paying  \nagents or other service providers, that would \nmake it necessary for the firm to make        \npayments related to these entities other than \nthose required under the terms of the         \nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and     \nrelated contractual arrangements and in       \nconnection with certain expenses incurred by  \nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of \nService Providers. In the ordinary course of  \nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees \ncertain service providers, such as clearing   \nand custody agents, trustees and              \nadministrators, against specified potential   \nlosses in connection with their acting as an  \nagent of, or providing services to, the firm  \nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses   \narising from its custodial role or caused by  \nacts or omissions of third-party service      \nproviders, including sub-custodiansand third- \nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has \nthe right to seek indemnification from these  \nthird-party service providers for certain     \nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In      \naddition, the firm is a member of payment,    \nclearing and settlement networks, as well as  \nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of   \nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of   \nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In  \nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear \nand settle on behalf of its clients the       \ntransactions entered into by them with other  \nbrokerage firms. The firm\u2019s obligations in    \nrespect of such transactions are secured by   \nthe assets in the client\u2019s account, as well as\nany proceeds received from the transactions   \ncleared and settled by the firm on behalf of  \nthe client. In connection with joint venture  \ninvestments, the firm may issue loan          \nguarantees under which it may be liable in the\nevent of fraud, misappropriation,             \nenvironmental liabilities and certain other   \nmatters involving the borrower. The firm is   \nunable to develop an estimate of the maximum  \npayout under these guarantees and             \nindemnifications. However, management believes\nthat it is unlikely the firm will have to make\nany material payments under these             \narrangements, and no material liabilities     \nrelated to these guarantees and               \nindemnifications have been recognized in the  \nconsolidated balance sheets as of both June   \n2022 and December 2021.                       \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    70  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Other Representations, Warranties \nand Indemnifications. The firm provides       \nrepresentations and warranties to             \ncounterparties in connection with a variety of\ncommercial transactions and occasionally      \nindemnifies them against potential losses     \ncaused by the breach of those representations \nand warranties. The firm may also provide     \nindemnifications protecting against changes in\nor adverse application of certain U.S. tax    \nlaws in connection with ordinary-course       \ntransactions, such as securities issuances,   \nborrowings or derivatives. In addition, the   \nfirm may provide indemnifications to some     \ncounterparties to protect them in the event   \nadditional taxes are owed or payments are     \nwithheld, due either to a change in or an     \nadverse application of certain non-U.S.tax    \nlaws. These indemnifications generally are    \nstandard contractual terms and are entered    \ninto in the ordinary course of business.      \nGenerally, there are no stated or notional    \namounts included in these indemnifications,   \nand the contingencies triggering the          \nobligation to indemnify are not expected to   \noccur. The firm is unable to develop an       \nestimate of the maximum payout under these    \nguarantees and indemnifications. However,     \nmanagement believes that it is unlikely the   \nfirm will have to make any material payments  \nunder these arrangements, and no material     \nliabilities related to these arrangements have\nbeen recognized in the consolidated balance   \nsheets as of both June 2022 and December 2021.\nGuarantees of Subsidiaries. Group Inc. is the \nentity that fully and unconditionally         \nguarantees the securities issued by GS Finance\nCorp., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of   \nthe firm. Group Inc. has guaranteed the       \npayment obligations of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n(GS&Co.), GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Paris \nInc. et Cie, subject to certain exceptions. In\naddition, Group Inc. has provided guarantees  \nto Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and      \nGoldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) related to\nagreements that each entity has entered into  \nwith certain of its counterparties. Group Inc.\nguarantees many of the obligations of its     \nother consolidated subsidiaries on a          \ntransaction-by-transactionbasis, as negotiated\nwith counterparties. Group Inc. is unable to  \ndevelop an estimate of the maximum payout     \nunder its subsidiary guarantees.

Regulation and Capital Adequacy The  \nFRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a \nbank holding company under the U.S. Bank      \nHolding Company Act of 1956 and a financial   \nholding company under amendments to this Act. \nThe firm is subject to consolidated regulatory\ncapital requirements which are calculated in  \naccordance with the regulations of the FRB    \n(Capital Framework). The capital requirements \nare expressed as risk-based capital and       \nleverage ratios that compare measures of      \nregulatory capital to risk-weighted assets    \n(RWAs), average assets and off-balancesheet   \nexposures. Failure to comply with these       \ncapital requirements would result in          \nrestrictions being imposed by the firm\u2019s      \nregulators and could limit the firm\u2019s ability \nto repurchase shares, pay dividends and make  \ncertain discretionary compensation payments.  \nThe firm\u2019s capital levels are also subject to \nqualitative judgments by the regulators about \ncomponents of capital, risk weightings and    \nother factors. Furthermore, certain of the    \nfirm\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to separate   \nregulations and capital requirements. Capital \nFramework The regulations under the Capital   \nFramework are largely based on the Basel      \nCommittee on Banking Supervision\u2019s (Basel     \nCommittee) capital framework for strengthening\ninternational capital standards (Basel III)   \nand also implement certain provisions of the  \nDodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework,  \nthe firm is an \u201cAdvanced approaches\u201d banking  \norganization and has been designated as a     \nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB).   \nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum    \nrisk-based capital and the capital            \nconservation buffer requirements. The buffer  \nmust consist entirely of capital that         \nqualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)      \ncapital. The firm calculates its CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in    \naccordance with both the Standardized and     \nAdvanced Capital Rules. Each of the ratios    \ncalculated under the Standardized and Advanced\nCapital Rules must meet its respective capital\nrequirements. Under the Capital Framework, the\nfirm is also subject to leverage requirements \nwhich consist of a minimum Tier 1 leverage    \nratio and a minimum supplementary leverage    \nratio (SLR), as well as the SLR buffer.       \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    74  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For\nrisk management\npurposes, a 95 % one-\nday VaR is used,\nwhereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements,\na 99 % 10-day VaR is\nused to determine\nMarket RWAs and a 99 %\none-day VaR is used to\ndetermine regulatory\nVaR exceptions. In\naddition, the daily\nnet revenues used to\ndetermine risk\nmanagement VaR\nexceptions (i.e.,\ncomparing the daily\nnet revenues to the\nVaR measure calculated\nas of the end of the\nprior business day)\ninclude intraday\nactivity, whereas the\nCapital Framework\nrequires that intraday\nactivity be excluded\nfrom daily net\nrevenues when\ncalculating regulatory\nVaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity\nincludes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are\nmore likely than not\nto be positive by\ntheir nature. As a\nresult, there may be\ndifferences in the\nnumber of VaR\nexceptions and the\namount of daily net\nrevenues calculated\nfor regulatory VaR\ncompared to the\namounts calculated for\nrisk management VaR.\n\nThe firm\u2019s positional\nlosses observed on a\nsingle day exceeded\nits 99 % one-day\nregulatory VaR on one\noccasion during both\nthe six months ended\nJune\u00a02022 and the year\nended 2021.

Standardized\nCredit RWAs as of June\n2022 decreased by $\n5.96billion compared\nwith December 2021,\nprimarily reflecting a\ndecrease in\nderivatives\n(principally due to\nreduced exposures) and\na decrease in equity\ninvestments\n(principally due to\nreduced exposures as a\nresult of unrealized\nlosses and sales).\nThese decreases were\npartially offset by an\nincrease in\ncommitments,\nguarantees and loans\n(principally due to\nincreased lending\nactivity) and an\nincrease in other\ncredit RWAs\n(principally due to\nincreased other assets\nand customer and other\nreceivables\nexposures).\nStandardized Market\nRWAs as of June 2022\nincreased by $\n20.75billion compared\nwith December 2021,\nprimarily reflecting\nan increase in\nregulatory VaR\n(principally due to\nhigher levels of\nmarket volatility), an\nincrease in\nincremental risk\n(principally due to\nincreased exposures)\nand an increase in\nspecific risk\n(principally due to\nincreased exposures).\nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of June 2022 increased\nby $ 17.81 billion compared with December     \n2021, primarily reflecting an increase in     \nother credit RWAs (principally due to         \nincreased other assets and customer and other \nreceivables exposures), an increase in        \ncommitments, guarantees and loans (principally\ndue to increased lending activity), an        \nincrease in securities financing transactions \n(principally due to increased funding         \nexposures) and an increase in derivatives     \n(principally due to increased counterparty    \ncredit risk). These increases were partially  \noffset by a decrease in equity investments    \n(principally due to reduced exposures as a    \nresult of unrealized losses and sales).       \nAdvanced Market RWAs as of June 2022 increased\nby$ 20.75billion compared with December 2021, \nprimarily reflecting an increase in regulatory\nVaR (principally due to higher levels of      \nmarket volatility), an increase in incremental\nrisk (principally due to increased exposures) \nand an increase in specific risk (principally \ndue to increased exposures). Year Ended       \nDecember 2021. Standardized Credit RWAs as of \nDecember 2021 increased by $ 114.92billion    \ncompared with December 2020, primarily        \nreflecting an increase in commitments,        \nguarantees and loans (principally due to      \nincreased lending activity and revisions to   \ncertain interpretations of the Capital Rules  \nunderlying the RWA calculation based on       \nregulatory feedback) and an increase in       \nderivatives (principally due to increased     \nexposures and the impact of SA-CCRadoption).  \nStandardized Market RWAs as of December 2021  \nincreased by $ 7.79billion compared with      \nDecember 2020, primarily reflecting an        \nincrease in stressed VaR (principally due to  \nincreased exposures to interest rates).       \nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of December 2021      \nincreased by $ 25.79billion compared with     \nDecember 2020, primarily reflecting an        \nincrease in commitments, guarantees and loans \n(principally due to increased lending         \nactivity). This increase was partially offset \nby a decrease in equity investments           \n(principally due to the sale of equity        \npositions). Advanced Market RWAs as of        \nDecember 2021 increased by $ 7.79billion      \ncompared with December 2020, primarily        \nreflecting an increase in stressed VaR        \n(principally due to increased exposures to    \ninterest rates). Advanced Operational RWAs as \nof December 2021 increased by $ 4.60billion   \ncompared with December 2020, primarily        \nassociated with litigation and regulatory     \nproceedings.                                  \n                                           \n  79    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.                 \nAND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to                     \nConsolidated Financial                        \nStatements (Unaudited) Bank                   \nSubsidiaries                                  \n                                              \nG S Bank USA.

As of both June 2022 and        \nDecember 2021, GSBE was subject to and in     \ncompliance with applicable capital            \nrequirements for swap dealers and security-   \nbased swap dealers. Restrictions on Payments  \nGroup Inc. may be limited in its ability to   \naccess capital held at certain subsidiaries as\na result of regulatory, tax or other          \nconstraints. These limitations include        \nprovisions of applicable law and regulations  \nand other regulatory restrictions that limit  \nthe ability of those subsidiaries to declare  \nand pay dividends without prior regulatory    \napproval. For example, the amount of dividends\nthat may be paid by GS Bank USA are limited to\nthe lesser of the amounts calculated under a  \nrecent earnings test and an undivided profits \ntest. As a result of dividends paid in        \nconnection with the acquisition of GSBE in    \nJuly 2021, GS Bank USA cannot currently       \ndeclare any additional dividends without prior\nregulatory approval. In addition, subsidiaries\nnot subject to separate regulatory capital    \nrequirements may hold capital to satisfy local\ntax and legal guidelines, rating agency       \nrequirements (for entities with assigned      \ncredit ratings) or internal policies,         \nincluding policies concerning the minimum     \namount of capital a subsidiary should hold    \nbased on its underlying level of risk.

Income Taxes Provision for Income    \nTaxes Income taxes are provided for using the \nasset and liability method under which        \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are       \nrecognized for temporary differences between  \nthe financial reporting and tax bases of      \nassets and liabilities. The firm reports      \ninterest expense related to income tax matters\nin provision for taxes and income tax         \npenalties in other expenses. Deferred Income  \nTaxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net   \ntax effects of temporary differences between  \nthe financial reporting and tax bases of      \nassets and liabilities. These temporary       \ndifferences result in taxable or deductible   \namounts in future years and are measured using\nthe tax rates and laws that will be in effect \nwhen such differences are expected to reverse.\nValuation allowances are established to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount that more   \nlikely than not will be realized and primarily\nrelate to the ability to utilize losses in    \nvarious tax jurisdictions. Tax assets are     \nincluded in other assets and tax liabilities  \nare included in other liabilities.            \nUnrecognized Tax Benefits The firm recognizes \ntax positions in the consolidated financial   \nstatements only when it is more likely than   \nnot that the position will be sustained on    \nexamination by the relevant taxing authority  \nbased on the technical merits of the position.\nA position that meets this standard is        \nmeasured at the largest amount of benefit that\nwill more likely than not be realized on      \nsettlement. A liability is established for    \ndifferences between positions taken in a tax  \nreturn and amounts recognized in the          \nconsolidated financial statements. Regulatory \nTax Examinations The firm is subject to       \nexamination by the U.S. Internal Revenue      \nService (IRS) and other taxing authorities in \njurisdictions where the firm has significant  \nbusiness operations, such as the United       \nKingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states, \nsuch as New York. The tax years under         \nexamination vary by jurisdiction. The firm    \ndoes not expect completion of these audits to \nhave a material impact on the firm\u2019s financial\ncondition, but it may be material to operating\nresults for a particular period, depending, in\npart, on the operating results for that       \nperiod.                                       \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    84  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

This\nprogram allows the\nfirm to work with the\nIRS to identify and\nresolve potential U.S.\nFederal tax issues\nbefore the filing of\ntax returns. All\nissues for the 2011\ntax year have been\nresolved and\ncompletion is pending\nfinal administrative\nsettlement. During\nApril\u00a02022, the firm\nreached an agreement\nwith IRS Appeals on\nthe remaining issues\nfor tax years 2012\nthrough 2018. Subject\nto final review by the\nJoint Committee on\nTaxation, this\nagreement will not\nhave a material impact\non the effective tax\nrate for 2022. The\n2019 and 2020 tax\nyears remain subject\nto post-filing review.\nNew York State and\nCity examinations of\n2015 through 2018\ncommenced during 2021.\n\nAll years, including\nand subsequent to the\nyears in the table\nabove, remain open to\nexamination by the\ntaxing authorities.\nThe firm believes that\nthe liability for\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits it has\nestablished is\nadequate in relation\nto the potential for\nadditional\nassessments.\nNote 25. Business Segments The firm reports   \nits activities in four business segments:     \nInvestment Banking, Global Markets, Asset     \nManagement and Consumer & Wealth Management.  \nSee Note 1 for information about the firm\u2019s   \nbusiness segments. Compensation and benefits  \nexpenses in the firm\u2019s segments reflect, among\nother factors, the overall performance of the \nfirm, as well as the performance of individual\nbusinesses. Consequently, pre-taxmargins in   \none segment of the firm\u2019s business may be     \nsignificantly affected by the performance of  \nthe firm\u2019s other business segments. The firm  \nallocates assets (including allocations of    \nglobal core liquid assets and cash, secured   \nclient financing and other assets), revenues  \nand expenses among the four business segments.\nDue to the integrated nature of these         \nsegments, estimates and judgments are made in \nallocating certain assets, revenues and       \nexpenses. The allocation process is based on  \nthe manner in which management currently views\nthe performance of the segments. The          \nallocation of common shareholders\u2019 equity and \npreferred stock dividends to each segment is  \nbased on the estimated amount of equity       \nrequired to support the activities of the     \nsegment under relevant regulatory capital     \nrequirements. Net earnings for each segment is\ncalculated by applying the firmwide tax rate  \nto each segment\u2019s pre-taxearnings. Management \nbelieves that this allocation provides a      \nreasonable representation of each segment\u2019s   \ncontribution to consolidated net earnings to  \ncommon, return on average common equity and   \ntotal assets. Transactions between segments   \nare based on specific criteria or approximate \nthird-party rates.                            \n                                           \n  85    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Based on our reviews, \nwe are not aware of any material modifications\nthat should be made to the accompanying       \ninterim financial statements for them to be in\nconformity with accounting principles         \ngenerally accepted in the United States of    \nAmerica. We have previously audited, in       \naccordance with the standards of the Public   \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United    \nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance     \nsheet of the Company as of December 31, 2021, \nand the related consolidated statements of    \nearnings, comprehensive income, changes in    \nshareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for the   \nyear then ended (not presented herein), and in\nour report dated February 24, 2022, which     \nincluded a paragraph describing a change in   \nthe manner of accounting for credit losses on \ncertain financial instruments in the 2020     \nconsolidated financial statements, we         \nexpressed an unqualified opinion on those     \nconsolidated financial statements. In our     \nopinion, the information set forth in the     \naccompanying consolidated balance sheet as of \nDecember 31, 2021 is fairly stated in all     \nmaterial respects in relation to the          \nconsolidated balance sheet from which it has  \nbeen derived. Basis for Review Results These  \ninterim financial statements are the          \nresponsibility of the Company\u2019s management. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with  \nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent  \nwith respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the      \napplicable rules and regulations of the       \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the    \nPCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance  \nwith the standards of the PCAOB. A review of  \ninterim financial information consists        \nprincipally of applying analytical procedures \nand making inquiries of persons responsible   \nfor financial and accounting matters. It is   \nsubstantially less in scope than an audit     \nconducted in accordance with the standards of \nthe PCAOB, the objective of which is the      \nexpression of an opinion regarding the        \nfinancial statements taken as a whole.        \nAccordingly, we do not express such an        \nopinion. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New   \nYork, New York August 3, 2022                 \n                                           \n  99    Goldman\u00a0Sachs June\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We generated net earnings of $2.93 \nbillion for the second quarter of 2022,       \ncompared with $5.49 billion for the second    \nquarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per common  \nshare (EPS) was $7.73 for the second quarter  \nof 2022 compared with $15.02 for the second   \nquarter of 2021. Annualized return on average \ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity (ROE) was 10.6%   \nfor the second quarter of 2022, compared with \n23.7% for the second quarter of 2021. Book    \nvalue per common share was $301.88 as of June \n2022, 2.9% higher compared with March 2022 and\n6.2% higher compared with December 2021. Net  \nrevenues were $11.86 billion for the second   \nquarter of 2022, 23% lower than a strong      \nsecond quarter of 2021, reflecting            \nsignificantly lower net revenues in Asset     \nManagement and Investment Banking, partially  \noffset by significantly higher net revenues in\nGlobal Markets and Consumer & Wealth          \nManagement. Broad macroeconomic concerns and  \nthe prolonged war in Ukraine continued to     \ncontribute to the volatility in global equity \nprices, wider credit spreads and higher       \ninterest rates, contributing to net losses in \nEquity investments and significantly lower net\nrevenues in Lending and debt investments      \nwithin Asset Management and significantly     \nlower net revenues in Underwriting within     \nInvestment Banking. Net revenues in Global    \nMarkets reflected strong contributions from   \nboth Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities   \n(FICC) and Equities, particularly in          \nfinancing, and net revenues in Consumer &     \nWealth Management reflected growth in both    \nWealth management and Consumer banking.       \nProvision for credit losses was $667 million  \nfor the second quarter of 2022, compared with \na net benefit of $92 million in the second    \nquarter of 2021. Provisions for the second    \nquarter of 2022 reflected portfolio growth    \n(primarily in credit cards) and the impact of \nbroad macroeconomic concerns. The net benefit \nfor the second quarter of 2021 reflected      \nreserve reductions as the economic environment\ncontinued to improve following the initial    \nimpact of the coronavirus (COVID-19)pandemic, \npartially offset by portfolio growth.         \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    102  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nexpenses were $7.65 billion for the second    \nquarter of 2022, 11% lower than the second    \nquarter of 2021, reflecting significantly     \nlower compensation and benefits expenses      \n(reflecting a decline in operating performance\ncompared with a strong prior year period),    \npartially offset by higher non-               \ncompensationexpenses. Our efficiency ratio    \n(total operating expenses divided by total net\nrevenues) for the second quarter of 2022 was  \n64.5%, compared with 56.1% for the second     \nquarter of 2021. We returned $1.22 billion of \ncapital to common shareholders, including $500\nmillion of common share repurchases and $719  \nmillion of common stock dividends. As of June \n2022, our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital \nratio was 14.2% under the Standardized Capital\nRules and 14.3% under the Advanced Capital    \nRules. See Note 20 to the consolidated        \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout our capital ratios. In April 2022, we   \ncompleted the acquisition of NN Investment    \nPartners (NNIP) in our Asset Management       \nbusiness. Six Months Ended June 2022 versus   \nJune 2021. We generated net earnings of $6.87 \nbillion for the first half of 2022 compared   \nwith $12.32 billion for the first half of     \n2021. Diluted EPS was $18.47 for the first    \nhalf of 2022 compared with $33.64 for the     \nfirst half of 2021. Annualized ROE was 12.8%  \nfor the first half of 2022, compared with     \n27.3% for the first half of 2021. Net revenues\nwere $24.80 billion for the first half of     \n2022, 25% lower than a strong first half of   \n2021, reflecting significantly lower net      \nrevenues in Asset Management and Investment   \nBanking, partially offset by higher net       \nrevenues in Global Markets and Consumer &     \nWealth Management. Broad macroeconomic and    \ngeopolitical concerns led to volatility in    \nglobal equity prices and wider credit spreads,\ncontributing to net losses in Equity          \ninvestments and significantly lower net       \nrevenues in Lending and debt investments      \nwithin Asset Management and significantly     \nlower net revenues in Equity underwriting     \nwithin Investment Banking. Net revenues in    \nGlobal Markets reflected significantly higher \nnet revenues in FICC, partially offset by     \nslightly lower net revenues in Equities       \ncompared with a strong prior year period, and \nnet revenues in Consumer & Wealth Management  \nreflected growth in both Wealth management and\nConsumer banking. Provision for credit losses \nwas $1.23 billion for the first half of 2022, \ncompared with a net benefit of $162 million in\nthe first half of 2021. Provisions in the     \nfirst half of 2022 primarily reflected        \nportfolio growth (primarily in credit cards)  \nand the impact of macroeconomic and           \ngeopolitical concerns. The net benefit in the \nfirst half of 2021 reflected reserve          \nreductions as the broad economic environment  \ncontinued to improve following the initial    \nimpact of the COVID-19pandemic, partially     \noffset by portfolio growth. Operating expenses\nwere $15.37 billion for the first half of     \n2022, 15% lower than the first half of 2021,  \nreflecting significantly lower compensation   \nand benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in\noperating performance compared with a strong  \nprior year period), partially offset by higher\nnon-compensationexpenses. Our efficiency ratio\nfor the first half of 2022 was 62.0%, compared\nwith 54.6% for the first half of 2021. During \nthe first half of 2022, we returned $2.43     \nbillion of capital to common shareholders,    \nincluding $1.00 billion of common share       \nrepurchases and $1.43 billion of common stock \ndividends. Business Environment During the    \nsecond quarter of 2022, the continuation of   \nbroad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns,\nincluding inflationary pressures and the      \nprolonged war in Ukraine, and uncertainty     \nabout the outlook weighed on economic activity\nand kept market volatility high. In response, \nglobal central banks have continued to tighten\nmonetary policy with additional policy        \ninterest rates increases during the quarter.  \nThese factors contributed to a decrease in    \nglobal equity prices and wider corporate      \ncredit spreads compared with the end of the   \nfirst quarter of 2022. The economic outlook   \nremains uncertain, reflecting concerns about  \nthe continuation or escalation of the war     \nbetween Russia and Ukraine and other          \ngeopolitical risks, inflation and supply chain\ncomplications, and the persistence of         \nCOVID-19-relatedeffects.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis The      \nallowance for credit losses also includes     \nqualitative components which allow management \nto reflect the uncertain nature of economic   \nforecasting, capture uncertainty regarding    \nmodel inputs, and account for model           \nimprecision and concentration risk. Our       \nestimate of credit losses entails judgment    \nabout collectability at the reporting dates,  \nand there are uncertainties inherent in those \njudgments. The allowance for credit losses is \nsubject to a governance process that involves \nreview and approval by senior management      \nwithin our independent risk oversight and     \ncontrol functions. Personnel within our       \nindependent risk oversight and control        \nfunctions are responsible for forecasting the \neconomic variables that underlie the economic \nscenarios that are used in the modeling of    \nexpected credit losses. While we use the best \ninformation available to determine this       \nestimate, future adjustments to the allowance \nmay be necessary based on, among other things,\nchanges in the economic environment or        \nvariances between actual results and the      \noriginal assumptions used. Loans are charged  \noff against the allowance for loan losses when\ndeemed to be uncollectible. We also record an \nallowance for credit losses on lending        \ncommitments which are held for investment that\nare accounted for at amortized cost. Such     \nallowance is determined using the same        \nmethodology as the allowance for loan losses, \nwhile also taking into consideration the      \nprobability of drawdowns or funding, and      \nwhether such commitments are cancellable by   \nus. To estimate the potential impact of an    \nadverse macroeconomic environment on our      \nallowance for credit losses, we, among other  \nthings, compared the expected credit losses   \nunder the weighted average forecast used in   \nthe calculation of allowance for credit losses\nas of June 2022 (which was weighted towards   \nthe baseline and adverse economic scenarios)  \nto the expected credit losses under a 100%    \nweighted adverse economic scenario. The       \nadverse macroeconomic scenario assumes a      \nglobal recession in the second half of 2022   \nthrough the first half of 2023 resulting in an\neconomic contraction, decline in consumer     \nspending and rising unemployment rates. A 100%\nweighting to the adverse economic scenario    \nwould have resulted in an approximate $1.1    \nbillion increase in our allowance for credit  \nlosses as of June 2022. This hypothetical     \nincrease does not take into consideration any \npotential adjustments to qualitative reserves.\nThe forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are \ninherently uncertain and do not take into     \naccount any other offsetting or correlated    \neffects. The actual credit loss in an adverse \nmacroeconomic environment may differ          \nsignificantly from this estimate. See Note 9  \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about the allowance for   \ncredit losses. Use of Estimates U.S. GAAP     \nrequires us to make certain estimates and     \nassumptions. In addition to the estimates we  \nmake in connection with fair value            \nmeasurements and the allowance for credit     \nlosses on loans and lending commitments held  \nfor investment and accounted for at amortized \ncost, the use of estimates and assumptions is \nalso important in determining discretionary   \ncompensation accruals, the accounting for     \ngoodwill and identifiable intangible assets,  \nprovisions for losses that may arise from     \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings         \n(including governmental investigations), and  \naccounting for income taxes. A substantial    \nportion of our compensation and benefits      \nrepresents discretionary compensation, which  \nis finalized at year-end.We believe the most  \nappropriate way to allocate estimated year-   \nenddiscretionary compensation among interim   \nperiods is in proportion to the net revenues  \nnet of provision for credit losses earned in  \nsuch periods. In addition to the level of net \nrevenues net of provision for credit losses,  \nour overall compensation expense in any given \nyear is also influenced by, among other       \nfactors, overall financial performance,       \nprevailing labor markets, business mix, the   \nstructure of our share-based compensation     \nprograms and the external environment.        \nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually  \nin the fourth quarter or more frequently if   \nevents occur or circumstances change that     \nindicate an impairment may exist. When        \nassessing goodwill for impairment, first, a   \nqualitative assessment can be made to         \ndetermine whether it is more likely than not  \nthat the estimated fair value of a reporting  \nunit is less than its estimated carrying      \nvalue. If the results of the qualitative      \nassessment are not conclusive, a quantitative \ngoodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a  \nquantitative goodwill test can be performed   \nwithout performing a qualitative assessment.  \nEstimating the fair value of our reporting    \nunits requires judgment. Critical inputs to   \nthe fair value estimates include projected    \nearnings and allocated equity. There is       \ninherent uncertainty in the projected         \nearnings. The estimated carrying value of each\nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and represents the       \nestimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity\nrequired to support the activities of the     \nreporting unit under currently applicable     \nregulatory capital requirements. See Note 12  \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about goodwill. If we     \nexperience a prolonged or severe period of    \nweakness in the business environment,         \nfinancial markets, our performance or our     \ncommon stock price, or additional increases in\ncapital requirements, our goodwill could be   \nimpaired in the future.                       \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    106  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis          \nIdentifiable intangible assets are tested for \nimpairment when events or changes in          \ncircumstances suggest that an asset\u2019s or asset\ngroup\u2019s carrying value may not be fully       \nrecoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate \nwhether indications of potential impairment   \nhave occurred, and to test identifiable       \nintangible assets for impairment, if required.\nAn impairment is recognized if the estimated  \nundiscounted cash flows relating to the asset \nor asset group is less than the corresponding \ncarrying value. See Note 12 to the            \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about identifiable intangible     \nassets. We also estimate and provide for      \npotential losses that may arise out of        \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings to the  \nextent that such losses are probable and can  \nbe reasonably estimated. In addition, we      \nestimate the upper end of the range of        \nreasonably possible aggregate loss in excess  \nof the related reserves for litigation and    \nregulatory proceedings where we believe the   \nrisk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18\nand 27 to the consolidated financial          \nstatements for information about certain      \njudicial, litigation and regulatory           \nproceedings. Significant judgment is required \nin making these estimates and our final       \nliabilities may ultimately be materially      \ndifferent. Our total estimated liability in   \nrespect of litigation and regulatory          \nproceedings is determined on a case-by-       \ncasebasis and represents an estimate of       \nprobable losses after considering, among other\nfactors, the progress of each case, proceeding\nor investigation, our experience and the      \nexperience of others in similar cases,        \nproceedings or investigations, and the        \nopinions and views of legal counsel. In       \naccounting for income taxes, we recognize tax \npositions in the financial statements only    \nwhen it is more likely than not that the      \nposition will be sustained on examination by  \nthe relevant taxing authority based on the    \ntechnical merits of the position. We use      \nestimates to recognize current and deferred   \nincome taxes in the U.S. federal, state and   \nlocal and non-U.S.jurisdictions in which we   \noperate. The income tax laws in these         \njurisdictions are complex and can be subject  \nto different interpretations between taxpayers\nand taxing authorities. Disputes may arise    \nover these interpretations and can be settled \nby audit, administrative appeals or judicial  \nproceedings. Our interpretations are          \nreevaluated quarterly based on guidance       \ncurrently available, tax examination          \nexperience and the opinions of legal counsel, \namong other factors. We recognize deferred    \ntaxes based on the amount that will more      \nlikely than not be realized in the future     \nbased on enacted income tax laws. Our estimate\nfor deferred taxes includes estimates for     \nfuture taxable earnings, including the level  \nand character of those earnings, and various  \ntax planning strategies.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nEnvironment. During the second quarter of     \n2022, the operating environment continued to  \nbe generally characterized by broad           \nmacroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and   \nmarket volatility, which contributed to a     \ndecrease in global equity prices, wider credit\nspreads and a further increase in commodity   \nprices compared with the end of the first     \nquarter of 2022. These factors contributed to \nsolid market-making activity levels and a     \ndecline in industry-wide underwriting volumes,\nwhile industry-wide mergers and acquisitions  \nvolumes remained strong. Additionally, global \ncentral banks addressed inflation pressures by\nincreasing policy interest rates. If concerns \nabout the economic outlook grow, including    \nthose about the continuation or escalation of \ngeopolitical concerns, inflation and supply   \nchain complications, and the persistence of   \nCOVID-19-relatedeffects, it may lead to a     \ncontinued decline in equity prices or further \nwidening of credit spreads, or a decline in   \nmarket-making activity levels, or a continued \ndecline in investment banking volumes, and net\nrevenues and provision for credit losses would\nlikely be negatively impacted. See \u201cSegment   \nAssets and Operating Results \u2014 Segment        \nOperating Results\u201d for information about the  \noperating environment and material trends and \nuncertainties that may impact our results of  \noperations. Three Months Ended June 2022      \nversus June 2021. Net revenues in the         \nconsolidated statements of earnings were      \n$11.86 billion for the second quarter of 2022,\n23% lower than a strong second quarter of     \n2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower\nother principal transactions revenues and     \ninvestment banking revenues, partially offset \nby significantly higher market making         \nrevenues, investment management revenues and  \ncommissions and fees. Non-InterestRevenues.   \nInvestment banking revenues in the            \nconsolidated statements of earnings were $1.79\nbillion for the second quarter of 2022, 48%   \nlower than a strong second quarter of 2021,   \ndue to significantly lower revenues in both   \nequity and debt underwriting, reflecting a    \nsignificant decline in industry-wide activity,\nand slightly lower revenues in financial      \nadvisory, reflecting a decrease in industry-  \nwide completed mergers and acquisitions       \ntransactions. Investment management revenues  \nin the consolidated statements of earnings    \nwere $2.39 billion for the second quarter of  \n2022, 26% higher than the second quarter of   \n2021, primarily due to higher management and  \nother fees, primarily reflecting the inclusion\nof NNIP and the impact of fee waivers on money\nmarket funds in the prior year period.        \nCommissions and fees in the consolidated      \nstatements of earnings were $1.07 billion for \nthe second quarter of 2022, 29% higher than   \nthe second quarter of 2021, primarily         \nreflecting higher volumes in Equities. Market \nmaking revenues in the consolidated statements\nof earnings were $4.93 billion for the second \nquarter of 2022, 51% higher than the second   \nquarter of 2021, primarily reflecting         \nsignificantly higher revenues in interest rate\nproducts, commodities and currencies,         \npartially offset by negative revenues in      \nmortgages. Other principal transactions       \nrevenues in the consolidated statements of    \nearnings were a negative $50 million for the  \nsecond quarter of 2022, compared with $4.30   \nbillion for the second quarter of 2021,       \nprimarily reflecting significant mark-to-     \nmarketnet losses from investments in public   \nequities, significantly lower net gains from  \ninvestments in private equities compared with \na strong prior year period and net losses in  \ndebt investments compared with net gains in   \nthe prior year period. Net Interest Income.   \nNet interest income in the consolidated       \nstatements of earnings was $1.73 billion for  \nthe second quarter of 2022, 6% higher than the\nsecond quarter of 2021, reflecting an increase\nin interest income primarily related to       \ncollateralized agreements, other interest-    \nearning assets, and deposits with banks, each \nreflecting the impact of higher interest      \nrates, and loans, reflecting the impact of    \nhigher interest rates and higher average      \nbalances. The increase in interest income was \npartially offset by an increase in interest   \nexpense related to other interest-bearing     \nliabilities, borrowings, and collateralized   \nfinancings, each reflecting the impact of     \nhigher interest rates, and deposits reflecting\nthe impact of higher interest rates and higher\naverage balances.

During the second     \nquarter of 2022, Investment Banking operated  \nin an environment generally characterized by  \ncontinued strong industry-wide mergers and    \nacquisitions volumes, although completed      \nmergers and acquisitions volumes declined     \ncompared with the first quarter of 2022, as   \nwell as a continued decline in industry-wide  \nunderwriting volumes, as equity underwriting  \nvolumes remained low amid volatile equity     \nmarkets and a decline in prices, and debt     \nunderwriting volumes declined across leveraged\nfinance and investment-grade issuances amid   \nrising interest rates. In the future, if      \nmarket and economic conditions deteriorate    \nfurther, and industry-wide mergers and        \nacquisitions and underwriting volumes continue\nto decline, or credit spreads related to      \nhedges on our relationship lending portfolio  \ntighten, net revenues in Investment Banking   \nwould likely be negatively impacted. In       \naddition, if economic conditions deteriorate  \nfurther or if the creditworthiness of         \nborrowers deteriorates, provision for credit  \nlosses would likely be negatively impacted.   \nThree Months Ended June 2022 versus June 2021.\nNet revenues in Investment Banking were $2.14 \nbillion for the second quarter of 2022, 41%   \nlower than a strong second quarter of 2021,   \nprimarily reflecting significantly lower net  \nrevenues in Underwriting. The decrease in     \nUnderwriting was due to significantly lower   \nnet revenues in both Equity and Debt          \nunderwriting, reflecting a significant decline\nin industry-wide volumes. Net revenues in     \nFinancial advisory were slightly lower,       \nreflecting a decrease in industry-wide        \ncompleted mergers and acquisitions            \ntransactions. Corporate lending net revenues  \nwere significantly higher, primarily due to   \nnet gains from hedges related to relationship \nlending activities and higher net revenues    \nfrom transaction banking, partially offset by \nnet mark-downs of approximately $225 million  \non acquisition financing activities. Provision\nfor credit losses was $83 million for the     \nsecond quarter of 2022, compared with a net   \nbenefit of $107 million for the second quarter\nof 2021. Provisions in the second quarter of  \n2022 primarily reflected the impact of broad  \nmacroeconomic concerns, while the net benefit \nin the second quarter of 2021 reflected       \nreserve reductions as the broad economic      \nenvironment continued to improve following the\ninitial impact of the COVID-19pandemic.       \nOperating expenses were $1.11 billion for the \nsecond quarter of 2022, 43% lower than the    \nsecond quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting  \nsignificantly lower compensation and benefits \nexpenses. Pre-taxearnings were $949 million   \nfor the second quarter of 2022, 46% lower than\nthe second quarter of 2021.                   \n                                            \n  113    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

In this role, we seek to earn the\ndifference between the price at which a market\nparticipant is willing to sell an instrument  \nto us and the price at which another market   \nparticipant is willing to buy it from us, and \nvice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In       \naddition, we maintain (i) market-making       \npositions, typically for a short period of    \ntime, in response to, or in anticipation of,  \nclient demand, and (ii) positions to actively \nmanage our risk exposures that arise from     \nthese market-making activities (collectively, \ninventory). Our inventory is recorded in      \ntrading assets (long positions) or trading    \nliabilities (short positions) in our          \nconsolidated balance sheets. Our results are  \ninfluenced by a combination of interconnected \ndrivers, including (i) client activity levels \nand transactional bid/offer spreads           \n(collectively, client activity), and (ii)     \nchanges in the fair value of our inventory and\ninterest income and interest expense related  \nto the holding, hedging and funding of our    \ninventory (collectively, market-making        \ninventory changes). Due to the integrated     \nnature of our market-making activities,       \ndisaggregation of net revenues into client    \nactivity and market-making inventory changes  \nis judgmental and has inherent complexities   \nand limitations. The amount and composition of\nour net revenues vary over time as these      \ndrivers are impacted by multiple interrelated \nfactors affecting economic and market         \nconditions, including volatility and liquidity\nin the market, changes in interest rates,     \ncurrency exchange rates, credit spreads,      \nequity prices and commodity prices, investor  \nconfidence, and other macroeconomic concerns  \nand uncertainties. In general, assuming all   \nother market-making conditions remain         \nconstant, increases in client activity levels \nor bid/offer spreads tend to result in        \nincreases in net revenues, and decreases tend \nto have the opposite effect. However, changes \nin market-making conditions can materially    \nimpact client activity levels and bid/offer   \nspreads, as well as the fair value of our     \ninventory. For example, a decrease in         \nliquidity in the market could have the impact \nof (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii)  \ndecreasing investor confidence and thereby    \ndecreasing client activity levels, and (iii)  \nwidening of credit spreads on our inventory   \npositions.                                    \n                                            \n  115    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis As       \nrequired by the FRB\u2019s CCAR rules, we submit an\nannual capital plan for review by the FRB. The\npurpose of the FRB\u2019s review is to ensure that \nwe have a robust, forward-looking capital     \nplanning process that accounts for our unique \nrisks and that permits continued operation    \nduring times of economic and financial stress.\nThe FRB evaluates us based, in part, on       \nwhether we have the capital necessary to      \ncontinue operating under the baseline and     \nseverely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB\nand those developed internally. This          \nevaluation also takes into account our process\nfor identifying risk, our controls and        \ngovernance for capital planning, and our      \nguidelines for making capital planning        \ndecisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our \nplan to make capital distributions (i.e.,     \ndividend payments and repurchases or          \nredemptions of stock, subordinated debt or    \nother capital securities) and issue capital,  \nacross the range of macroeconomic scenarios   \nand firm-specific assumptions. The FRB        \ndetermines the stress capital buffer (SCB)    \napplicable to us based on its own annual      \nstress test. The SCB under the Standardized   \napproach is calculated as (i) the difference  \nbetween our starting and minimum projected    \nCET1 capital ratios under the supervisory     \nseverely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned\ncommon stock dividends for each of the fourth \nthrough seventh quarters of the planning      \nhorizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-   \nweighted assets (RWAs). Based on our 2022 CCAR\nsubmission, the FRB reduced our SCB from 6.4% \nto 6.3%, resulting in a Standardized CET1     \ncapital ratio requirement of 13.3% for the    \nperiod from October 1, 2022 through September \n30, 2023. See \u201cShare Repurchase Program\u201d for  \nfurther information about common stock        \nrepurchases and dividends. We published a     \nsummary of our annual DFAST results in June   \n2022. See \u201cAvailable Information.\u201d GS Bank USA\nis required to conduct stress tests on an     \nannual basis and publish a summary of certain \nresults. GS Bank USA published a summary of   \nits annual DFAST results in June 2022. See    \n\u201cAvailable Information.\u201d GSI, GSIB and Goldman\nSachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) also have their   \nown capital planning and stress testing       \nprocesses, which incorporate internally       \ndesigned stress tests developed in accordance \nwith the guidelines of their respective       \nregulators. Contingency Capital Plan. As part \nof our comprehensive capital management       \npolicy, we maintain a contingency capital     \nplan. Our contingency capital plan provides a \nframework for analyzing and responding to a   \nperceived or actual capital deficiency,       \nincluding, but not limited to, identification \nof drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as\nmitigants and potential actions. It outlines  \nthe appropriate communication procedures to   \nfollow during a crisis period, including      \ninternal dissemination of information, as well\nas timely communication with external         \nstakeholders. Capital Attribution. We assess  \neach of our businesses\u2019 capital usage based on\nour internal assessment of risks, which       \nincorporates an attribution of our relevant   \nregulatory capital requirements. These        \nregulatory capital requirements are allocated \nusing our attributed equity framework, which  \ntakes into consideration our most binding     \ncapital constraints. Our most binding capital \nconstraint is based on the results of the     \nFRB\u2019s annual stress test, which includes the  \nStandardized risk-based capital and leverage  \nratios. We review and make any necessary      \nadjustments to our attributed equity framework\nin January each year, to reflect, among other \nthings, the results of our latest CCAR        \nprocess, as well as projected changes in our  \nbalance sheet. On January 1, 2022, our        \nallocation of attributed equity changed       \n(relative to the allocation as of December    \n2021) as follows: attributed equity increased \nby approximately $1.0 billion for Consumer &  \nWealth Management and approximately $0.5      \nbillion for Investment Banking, while         \nattributed equity decreased by approximately  \n$0.8 billion for Global Markets and           \napproximately $0.7 billion for Asset          \nManagement. See \u201cSegment Assets and Operating \nResults \u2014 Segment Operating Results\u201d for      \ninformation about our average quarterly       \nattributed equity by segment. Share Repurchase\nProgram. We use our share repurchase program  \nto help maintain the appropriate level of     \ncommon equity. The repurchase program is      \neffected primarily through regular open-market\npurchases (which may include repurchase plans \ndesigned to comply with Rule 10b5-1and        \naccelerated share repurchases), the amounts   \nand timing of which are determined primarily  \nby our current and projected capital position \nand our capital plan submitted to the FRB as  \npart of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the   \nrepurchases may also be influenced by general \nmarket conditions and the prevailing price and\ntrading volumes of our common stock. During   \nthe second quarter of 2022, we returned a     \ntotal of $1.22 billion to shareholders,       \nincluding common stock repurchases of $500    \nmillion and common stock dividends of $719    \nmillion. The Board of Directors of Group Inc. \n(Board) approved an increase in our common    \nstock dividend from $2.00 to $2.50 per share  \nbeginning in the third quarter of 2022.       \nConsistent with our capital management        \nphilosophy, we will continue prioritizing     \ndeployment of capital for our clients where   \nreturns are attractive and return any excess  \ncapital to shareholders through dividends and \nshare repurchases. In addition, we continue to\nevaluate the level of share repurchases in    \nlight of our recent stock price. As of June   \n2022, the remaining share authorization under \nour existing repurchase program was 31.5      \nmillion shares.

Overview and Structure of \nRisk Management Overview We believe that      \neffective risk management is critical to our  \nsuccess. Accordingly, we have established an  \nenterprise risk management framework that     \nemploys a comprehensive, integrated approach  \nto risk management, and is designed to enable \ncomprehensive risk management processes       \nthrough which we identify, assess, monitor and\nmanage the risks we assume in conducting our  \nactivities. Our risk management structure is  \nbuilt around three core components:           \ngovernance, processes and people. Governance. \nRisk management governance starts with the    \nBoard, which both directly and through its    \ncommittees, including its Risk Committee,     \noversees our risk management policies and     \npractices implemented through the enterprise  \nrisk management framework. The Board is also  \nresponsible for the annual review and approval\nof our risk appetite statement. The risk      \nappetite statement describes the levels and   \ntypes of risk we are willing to accept or to  \navoid, in order to achieve our objectives     \nincluded in our strategic business plan, while\nremaining in compliance with regulatory       \nrequirements. The Board reviews our strategic \nbusiness plan and is ultimately responsible   \nfor overseeing and providing direction about  \nour strategy and risk appetite. The Board     \nreceives regular briefings on firmwide risks, \nincluding liquidity risk, market risk, credit \nrisk, operational risk and model risk, from   \nour independent risk oversight and control    \nfunctions, including the chief risk officer,  \nand on compliance risk and conduct risk from  \nCompliance, on legal and regulatory           \nenforcement matters from the chief legal      \nofficer, and on other matters impacting our   \nreputation from the chair of our Firmwide     \nClient and Business Standards Committee and   \nour Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The \nchief risk officer reports to our chief       \nexecutive officer and to the Risk Committee of\nthe Board. As part of the review of the       \nfirmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk       \nofficer regularly advises the Risk Committee  \nof the Board of relevant risk metrics and     \nmaterial exposures, including risk limits and \nthresholds established in our risk appetite   \nstatement. The implementation of our risk     \ngovernance structure and core risk management \nprocesses is overseen by Enterprise Risk,     \nwhich reports to our chief risk officer, and  \nis responsible for ensuring that our          \nenterprise risk management framework provides \nthe Board, our risk committees and senior     \nmanagement with a consistent and integrated   \napproach to managing our various risks in a   \nmanner consistent with our risk appetite. Our \nrevenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, \nEngineering, Human Capital Management,        \nOperations, and Corporate and Workplace       \nSolutions, are considered our first line of   \ndefense. They are accountable for the outcomes\nof our risk-generating activities, as well as \nfor assessing and managing those risks within \nour risk appetite. Our independent risk       \noversight and control functions are considered\nour second line of defense and provide        \nindependent assessment, oversight and         \nchallenge of the risks taken by our first line\nof defense, as well as lead and participate in\nrisk committees. Independent risk oversight   \nand control functions include Compliance,     \nConflicts Resolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk\nand Tax. Internal Audit is considered our     \nthird line of defense, and our director of    \nInternal Audit reports to the Audit Committee \nof the Board and administratively to our chief\nexecutive officer. Internal Audit includes    \nprofessionals with a broad range of audit and \nindustry experience, including risk management\nexpertise. Internal Audit is responsible for  \nindependently assessing and validating the    \neffectiveness of key controls, including those\nwithin the risk management framework, and     \nproviding timely reporting to the Audit       \nCommittee of the Board, senior management and \nregulators.                                   \n                                            \n  135    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

These systems also provide      \nmanagement with comprehensive information     \nabout our aggregate credit risk by product,   \ninternal credit rating, industry, country and \nregion. Risk Measures We measure our credit   \nrisk based on the potential loss in the event \nof non-paymentby a counterparty using current \nand potential exposure. For derivatives and   \nsecurities financing transactions, current    \nexposure represents the amount presently owed \nto us after taking into account applicable    \nnetting and collateral arrangements, while    \npotential exposure represents our estimate of \nthe future exposure that could arise over the \nlife of a transaction based on market         \nmovements within a specified confidence level.\nPotential exposure also takes into account    \nnetting and collateral arrangements. For loans\nand lending commitments, the primary measure  \nis a function of the notional amount of the   \nposition. Stress Tests We conduct regular     \nstress tests to calculate the credit          \nexposures, including potential concentrations \nthat would result from applying shocks to     \ncounterparty credit ratings or credit risk    \nfactors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates,\nequity prices). These shocks cover a wide     \nrange of moderate and more extreme market     \nmovements, including shocks to multiple risk  \nfactors, consistent with the occurrence of a  \nsevere market or economic event. In the case  \nof sovereign default, we estimate the direct  \nimpact of the default on our sovereign credit \nexposures, changes to our credit exposures    \narising from potential market moves in        \nresponse to the default, and the impact of    \ncredit market deterioration on corporate      \nborrowers and counterparties that may result  \nfrom the sovereign default. Unlike potential  \nexposure, which is calculated within a        \nspecified confidence level, stress testing    \ndoes not generally assume a probability of    \nthese events occurring. We also perform       \nfirmwide stress tests. See \u201cOverview and      \nStructure of Risk Management\u201d for information \nabout firmwide stress tests. To supplement    \nthese regular stress tests, as described      \nabove, we also conduct tailored stress tests  \non an ad hoc basis in response to specific    \nmarket events that we deem significant. We    \nalso utilize these stress tests to estimate   \nthe indirect impact of certain hypothetical   \nevents on our country exposures, such as the  \nimpact of credit market deterioration on      \ncorporate borrowers and counterparties along  \nwith the shocks to the risk factors described \nabove. The parameters of these shocks vary    \nbased on the scenario reflected in each stress\ntest. We review estimated losses produced by  \nthe stress tests in order to understand their \nmagnitude, highlight potential loss           \nconcentrations, and assess and mitigate our   \nexposures where necessary. Limits We use      \ncredit risk limits at various levels, as well \nas underwriting standards to manage the size  \nand nature of our credit exposures. Limits for\nindustries and countries are based on our risk\nappetite and are designed to allow for regular\nmonitoring, review, escalation and management \nof credit risk concentrations. See \u201cOverview  \nand Structure of Risk Management\u201d for         \ninformation about the limit approval process. \nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring     \nthese limits, and identifying and escalating  \nto senior management and/or the appropriate   \nrisk committee, on a timely basis, instances  \nwhere limits have been exceeded. Risk         \nMitigants To reduce our credit exposures on   \nderivatives and securities financing          \ntransactions, we may enter into netting       \nagreements with counterparties that permit us \nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. We may also reduce credit risk\nwith counterparties by entering into          \nagreements that enable us to obtain collateral\nfrom them on an upfront or contingent basis   \nand/or to terminate transactions if the       \ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating falls below a    \nspecified level. We monitor the fair value of \nthe collateral to ensure that our credit      \nexposures are appropriately collateralized. We\nseek to minimize exposures where there is a   \nsignificant positive correlation between the  \ncreditworthiness of our counterparties and the\nmarket value of collateral we receive. For    \nloans and lending commitments, depending on   \nthe credit quality of the borrower and other  \ncharacteristics of the transaction, we employ \na variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk   \nmitigants include collateral provisions,      \nguarantees, covenants, structural seniority of\nthe bank loan claims and, for certain lending \ncommitments, provisions in the legal          \ndocumentation that allow us to adjust loan    \namounts, pricing, structure and other terms as\nmarket conditions change. The type and        \nstructure of risk mitigants employed can      \nsignificantly influence the degree of credit  \nrisk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into\na counterparty\u2019s financial strength or when we\nbelieve a counterparty requires support from  \nits parent, we may obtain third-party         \nguarantees of the counterparty\u2019s obligations. \nWe may also mitigate our credit risk using    \ncredit derivatives or participation           \nagreements.                                   \n                                            \n  151    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Country  \nExposures. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has\nnegatively affected the global economy and has\nresulted in significant disruptions in        \nfinancial markets and increased macroeconomic \nuncertainty. Governments around the world have\nresponded to Russia\u2019s invasion by imposing    \neconomic sanctions and export controls on     \nspecific industry sectors, companies and      \nindividuals in Russia. Retaliatory            \nrestrictions against investors, non-          \nRussianowned businesses and other sovereign   \nstates have been implemented by Russia.       \nBusinesses in the U.S. and globally have      \nexperienced shortages in materials and        \nincreased costs for transportation, energy and\nraw materials due, in part, to the negative   \neffects of the war on the global economy. The \nescalation or continuation of the war between \nRussia and Ukraine presents heightened risks  \nrelating to cyber attacks, the frequency and  \nvolume of failures to settle securities       \ntransactions, supply chain disruptions, and   \ninflation, as well as the potential for       \nincreased volatility in commodity, currency   \nand other financial markets. Complying with   \neconomic sanctions and restrictions imposed by\ngovernments has resulted in increased         \noperational risk. The extent and duration of  \nthe war, sanctions and resulting market       \ndisruptions, as well as the potential adverse \nconsequences for our business, liquidity and  \nresults of operations, are difficult to       \npredict. Our senior management, risk          \ncommittees and the Board receive regular      \nbriefings from our independent risk oversight \nand control functions, including our chief    \nrisk officer, on Russian and Ukrainian        \nexposures, as well as other relevant risk     \nmetrics. We are focused on closing our        \npositions and reducing our exposure, and we   \ncontinue to wind down our operations in       \nRussia. The overall direct financial impact to\nour net revenues for the first half of 2022   \nfrom Russian and Ukrainian counterparties,    \nborrowers, issuers and related instruments was\nnot material. We have established a firmwide  \nworking group to identify and assess the      \noperational risk associated with complying    \nwith economic sanctions and restrictions as a \nresult of this invasion. In addition, to      \nmitigate the risk of increased cyber attacks, \nwe liaise with government agencies in order to\nupdate our monitoring processes with the      \nlatest information. Our total credit exposure \nto Russia as of June 2022 was $225 million,   \nsubstantially all of which was to non-        \nsovereigncounterparties. Such exposure        \nconsisted of $15 million related to OTC       \nderivatives and $210 million related to       \ndeposits and other receivables. In addition,  \nour total market exposure relating to Russian \nissuers as of June 2022 was not material. Our \ntotal credit exposure to Ukrainian            \ncounterparties or borrowers and our total     \nmarket exposure relating to Ukrainian issuers \nwas not material as of June 2022. High        \nexternal funding needs and inconsistent       \nmonetary policy have led to significant       \ndepreciation of the Turkish Lira, prompting   \nconcerns about foreign exchange reserves and  \neconomic instability. As of June 2022, our    \ntotal credit exposure to Turkey was $2.35     \nbillion, which was to non-                    \nsovereigncounterparties or borrowers. Such    \nexposure consisted of $1.16 billion related to\nOTC derivatives, $171 million related to loans\nand lending commitments and $1.02 billion     \nrelated to secured receivables. After taking  \ninto consideration the benefit of Turkish     \ncorporate and sovereign collateral, and other \nrisk mitigants provided by Turkish            \ncounterparties, our net credit exposure was   \n$841 million. In addition, our total market   \nexposure relating to Turkish issuers as of    \nJune 2022 was $(433) million, primarily to    \nsovereign issuers. Such exposure consisted of \n$(48) million related to debt, $(458) million \nrelated to credit derivatives and $73 million \nrelated to equities. Liquidity pressures      \nprompted the Argentine government to default  \nand restructure local and foreign obligations \nin 2020. Economic challenges persist despite a\nrenewed agreement with the International      \nMonetary Fund. As of June 2022, our total     \ncredit exposure to Argentina was $95 million, \nwhich was to non-sovereigncounterparties or   \nborrowers, and was primarily related to loans \nand lending commitments. In addition, our     \ntotal market exposure relating to Argentinian \nissuers as of June 2022 was $131 million,     \nprimarily to sovereign issuers. Such exposure \nconsisted of $88 million related to debt, $13 \nmillion related to credit derivatives and $30 \nmillion related to equities. In addition,     \neconomic and/or political uncertainties in    \nLebanon, Zambia, Venezuela, Ethiopia and Sri  \nLanka have led to concerns about their        \nfinancial stability. Our credit exposure to   \ncounterparties or borrowers and our market    \nexposure to issuers relating to each of these \ncountries was not material as of June 2022.   \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    158  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

We combine top-      \ndownand bottom-upapproaches to manage and     \nmeasure operational risk. From a top-         \ndownperspective, our senior management        \nassesses firmwide and business-level          \noperational risk profiles. From a bottom-     \nupperspective, our first and second lines of  \ndefense are responsible for risk              \nidentification and risk management on a day-  \nto-daybasis, including escalating operational \nrisks and risk events to senior management. We\nmaintain a comprehensive control framework    \ndesigned to provide a well-controlled         \nenvironment to minimize operational risks. The\nFirmwide Operational Risk and Resilience      \nCommittee is responsible for overseeing       \noperational risk, and for ensuring our        \nbusiness and operational resilience. Our      \noperational risk management framework is      \ndesigned to comply with the operational risk  \nmeasurement rules under the Capital Framework \nand has evolved based on the changing needs of\nour businesses and regulatory guidance. We    \nhave established policies that require all    \nemployees to report and escalate operational  \nrisk events. When operational risk events are \nidentified, our policies require that the     \nevents be documented and analyzed to determine\nwhether changes are required in our systems   \nand/or processes to further mitigate the risk \nof future events. We use operational risk     \nmanagement applications to capture, analyze,  \naggregate and report operational risk event   \ndata and key metrics. One of our key risk     \nidentification and assessment tools is an     \noperational risk and control self-assessment  \nprocess, which is performed by our managers.  \nThis process consists of the identification   \nand rating of operational risks, on a forward-\nlooking basis, and the related controls. The  \nresults from this process are analyzed to     \nevaluate operational risk exposures and       \nidentify businesses, activities or products   \nwith heightened levels of operational risk.   \n                                            \n  159    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Climate  \nRisk Management We categorize climate risk    \ninto physical risk and transition risk.       \nPhysical risk is the risk that asset values   \nmay decline or operations may be disrupted as \na result of changes in the climate, while     \ntransition risk is the risk that asset values \nmay decline because of changes in climate     \npolicies or changes in the underlying economy \ndue to decarbonization. As a global financial \ninstitution, climate-related risks manifest in\ndifferent ways across our businesses and we   \nhave continued to make significant            \nenhancements to our climate risk management   \nframework, including steps to further         \nintegrate climate into our broader risk       \nmanagement processes. We have integrated      \noversight of climate-related risks into our   \nrisk management governance structure, from    \nsenior management to our Board and its        \ncommittees, including the Risk and Public     \nResponsibilities Committees. The Risk         \nCommittee of the Board oversees firmwide      \nfinancial and nonfinancial risks, which       \ninclude climate risk, and, as part of its     \noversight, receives updates on our risk       \nmanagement approach to climate risk, including\nour approaches towards scenario analysis and  \nintegration into existing risk management     \nprocesses. The Public Responsibilities        \nCommittee of the Board assists the Board in   \nits oversight of our firmwide sustainability  \nstrategy and sustainability issues affecting  \nus, including with respect to climate change. \nAs part of its oversight, the Public          \nResponsibilities Committee receives periodic  \nupdates on our sustainability strategy, and   \nalso periodically reviews our governance and  \nrelated policies and processes for            \nsustainability and climate change-related     \nrisks. Senior management within Risk is       \nresponsible for the development of our climate\nrisk program. We have begun incorporating     \nclimate risk into our credit evaluation and   \nunderwriting processes for select industries. \nClimate risk factors are now evaluated as part\nof transaction due diligence for select loan  \ncommitments. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Sustainability\u201d  \nin Part I, Item 1 and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part  \nI, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-Kfor           \ninformation about our sustainability          \ninitiatives, including in relation to climate \ntransition. Compliance Risk Management        \nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or       \nregulatory sanctions, material financial loss \nor damage to our reputation arising from our  \nfailure to comply with the requirements of    \napplicable laws, rules and regulations, and   \nour internal policies and procedures.         \nCompliance risk is inherent in all activities \nthrough which we conduct our businesses. Our  \nCompliance Risk Management Program,           \nadministered by Compliance, assesses our      \ncompliance, regulatory and reputational risk; \nmonitors for compliance with new or amended   \nlaws, rules and regulations; designs and      \nimplements controls, policies, procedures and \ntraining; conducts independent testing;       \ninvestigates, surveils and monitors for       \ncompliance risks and breaches; and leads our  \nresponses to regulatory examinations, audits  \nand inquiries. We monitor and review business \npractices to assess whether they meet or      \nexceed minimum regulatory and legal standards \nin all markets and jurisdictions in which we  \nconduct business. Conflicts Management        \nConflicts of interest and our approach to     \ndealing with them are fundamental to our      \nclient relationships, our reputation and our  \nlong-term success. The term \u201cconflict of      \ninterest\u201d does not have a universally accepted\nmeaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms\nwithin a business or between businesses. The  \nresponsibility for identifying potential      \nconflicts, as well as complying with our      \npolicies and procedures, is shared by all of  \nour employees. We have a multilayered approach\nto resolving conflicts and addressing         \nreputational risk. Our senior management      \noversees policies related to conflicts        \nresolution and, in conjunction with Conflicts \nResolution, Legal and Compliance, the Firmwide\nClient and Business Standards Committee, and  \nother internal committees, formulates         \npolicies, standards and principles, and       \nassists in making judgments regarding the     \nappropriate resolution of particular          \nconflicts. Resolving potential conflicts      \nnecessarily depends on the facts and          \ncircumstances of a particular situation and   \nthe application of experienced and informed   \njudgment. As a general matter, Conflicts      \nResolution reviews financing and advisory     \nassignments in Investment Banking and certain \nof our investing, lending and other           \nactivities. In addition, we have various      \ntransaction oversight committees, such as the \nFirmwide Capital, Commitments and Suitability \nCommittees and other committees that also     \nreview new underwritings, loans, investments  \nand structured products. These groups and     \ncommittees work with internal and external    \ncounsel and Compliance to evaluate and address\nany actual or potential conflicts. The head of\nConflicts Resolution reports to our chief     \nlegal officer, who reports to our chief       \nexecutive officer.                            \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    162  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.
