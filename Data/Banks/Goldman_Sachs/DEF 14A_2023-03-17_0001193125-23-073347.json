These statements are not        \n  historical facts, but instead represent     \n  only our beliefs regarding future events,   \n  many of which, by their nature, are         \n  inherently uncertain and outside of our     \n  control. Forward-looking statements         \n  include statements about our businesses,    \n  expense savings initiatives, interest       \n  expense savings, funding optimization and   \n  durability of earnings as well as the       \n  effectiveness of our management of our      \n  human capital, including our aspirational   \n  diversity goals, and may relate to, among   \n  other things, our future plans and          \n  results, including the impact of our        \n  strategic realignment and our target ROE ,  \n  ROTE, efficiency ratio and CET1 ratio, and  \n  how they can be achieved, and goals         \n  relating to our sustainability              \n  initiatives. It is possible that the        \n  firm\u2019s actual results, including the        \n  incremental revenues and savings, enhanced  \n  funding optimization and increase in        \n  durability of earnings, if any, from such   \n  initiatives, and financial condition may    \n  differ, possibly materially, from the       \n  anticipated results, financial condition    \n  and incremental revenues and savings,       \n  enhanced funding optimization or increased  \n  durability in earnings indicated in these   \n  forward-looking statements. Statements      \n  about Goldman Sachs\u2019 business, savings and  \n  other initiatives are subject to the risk   \n  that our businesses may be unable to        \n  generate additional incremental revenues    \n  or reduce expenses consistent with current  \n  expectations. For a discussion of some of   \n  the risks and important factors that could  \n  affect our future results and financial     \n  condition, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Goldman    \n  Sachs\u2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the   \n  year ended December 31, 2022.References to  \n  our website or other links to our           \n  publications or other information are       \n  provided for the convenience of our         \n  shareholders.

Under the leadership of David  \n  Solomon, John Waldron and Denis Coleman,    \n  and with the oversight of the Board, the    \n  firm remained nimble, was able to support   \n  our clients across the breadth of our       \n  global franchises, and prudently managed    \n  capital, liquidity, and financial and       \n  nonfinancial risks, in order to deliver     \n  the firm\u2019s second highest ever net          \n  revenues and double-digit returns for       \n  shareholders.As you heard in more detail    \n  from David and our leadership team last     \n  month during our 2023 Investor Day          \n  presentations, 2022 also provided an        \n  important inflection point to further       \n  evolve our strategy, realign our            \n  businesses, reorient the firm for the       \n  forward opportunity set and reinvest in     \n  our culture. I hope that this recent        \n  Investor Day provided you with important    \n  clarity on the firm\u2019s strategic path. The   \n  Board is fully supportive of management\u2019s   \n  ongoing focus on enhancing transparency     \n  and accountability, and our 2023 Investor   \n  Day was an important affirmation of         \n  this.As I\u2019ve communicated to you before,    \n  we as a Board are cognizant of our role as  \n  stewards of your investment, and we will    \n  continue to engage with management on \u2013     \n  and hold management accountable for \u2013       \n  creating long-term value for you, our       \n  shareholders. To this end, as a Board, we   \n  engaged regularly over the course of the    \n  year \u2013 not only with David, John and Denis  \n  \u2013 but with the broader management and       \n  control teams as well as with employees     \n  across the firm \u2013 on the key drivers and    \n  risks relating to the execution of our      \n  strategy on firmwide, regional and          \n  business levels.Execution of our strategy   \n  and a focus on prudent resource management  \n  will continue to be top of mind for the     \n  Board in the coming year. We will continue  \n  to focus not only on our financial results  \n  but also on how they are achieved; we       \n  firmly believe that long-term value         \n  creation and the realization of our         \n  communicated goals necessitates a           \n  commitment to our culture and Core Values,  \n  sound risk management and controls, and an  \n  unwavering dedication to our clients and    \n  our people. In this regard, we remain       \n  steadfast in our determination to maintain  \n  a strong and appropriately resourced        \n  control environment.We also continue to     \n  oversee management\u2019s investment in our      \n  future. This includes maintaining our       \n  focus on fundamental considerations and     \n  priorities, such as attracting and          \n  retaining the best talent, continued        \n  progress around diversity, inclusion and    \n  equity, the development of the firm\u2019s       \n  \u201cnext generation\u201d of leaders, the           \n  strength, depth and diversity of our        \n  leadership bench, further progress toward   \n  achieving our sustainable finance targets,  \n  and reinvesting in and strengthening our    \n  culture.For example, as you will see in     \n  theKey Areas of Board Oversightsection of   \n  this Proxy Statement, the firm recently     \n  launched a series of cultural stewardship   \n  and connection programs to reaffirm and     \n  reinvest in its culture. The firm\u2019s         \n  culture is a topic that we as directors     \n  regularly discuss \u2013 and will continue to    \n  discuss \u2013 with management. Investing in     \n  the firm\u2019s culture is a strategic           \n  imperative, particularly after the growth   \n  we have experienced over the last several   \n  years, and we are supportive of the steps   \n  that the firm has taken and continues to    \n  take in this regard.In carrying out our     \n  work, the Board met actively throughout     \n  2022, with 65 Board and Committee           \n  meetings, and for me, as Lead Director,     \n  over 65 additional meetings, calls and      \n  engagements with the firm and our people,   \n  our shareholders, regulators and other      \n  stakeholders, including meetings with       \n  shareholders representing over 20% of our   \n  shares outstanding. Similarly, my fellow    \n  Committee Chairs held over 140 such         \n  meetings during 2022. This broad and        \n  comprehensive engagement outside the        \n  boardroom provides us with key insights     \n  into the firm\u2019s businesses and its          \n  people.As you will see detailed in this     \n  Proxy Statement, there have been a number   \n  of changes to our Board over the past       \n  year, each of which was the result of our   \n  ongoing reviews of Board composition and    \n  governance processes, including with        \n  respect to board leadership succession      \n  planning. These processes and practices     \n  help to ensure that our Board has an        \n  appropriate and diverse mix of skills and   \n  experiences, strong independent             \n  leadership, and sound governance so that    \n  we can effectively carry out our            \n  responsibilities.PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT\u00a0FOR\u00a0THE\u00a0   \n  2023\u00a0ANNUAL\u00a0MEETING\u00a0OF\u00a0SHAREHOLDERS\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0    \n  GOLDMAN SACHSiii                            \n                                              \n                                              \n  LETTER FROM OUR LEAD DIRECTORIn October     \n  2022, we were pleased to welcome Kevin      \n  Johnson, the recently retired CEO of        \n  Starbucks, to our Board. Kevin has already  \n  proven to be an invaluable member of the    \n  Board, drawing upon his experiences across  \n  a breadth of subjects, including consumer   \n  leadership, technology and international    \n  business, as well as his many years as a    \n  business leader and director, to provide    \n  seasoned judgment to our Board.I also want  \n  to take a moment to extend my gratitude \u2013   \n  on behalf of the entire Board and the firm  \n  \u2013 to Mark Winkelman and Drew Faust, who     \n  are not standing for re-election pursuant   \n  to our retirement age policy, and will be   \n  retiring from our Board at our Annual       \n  Meeting. Each of them has been a dedicated  \n  steward of shareholder and other            \n  stakeholder interests, with a resolute      \n  focus on financial and nonfinancial risk    \n  management and unwavering commitment to     \n  the firm\u2019s culture and reputation. Their    \n  contributions, including Mark\u2019s role as     \n  Chair of our Risk Committee and, more       \n  recently, Chair of our Compensation         \n  Committee, and Drew\u2019s relentless focus on   \n  our people, culture, reputation andOne      \n  Goldman Sachs, are too numerous to detail.  \n  We wish them both continued success.As a    \n  result of our ongoing board leadership      \n  succession process, I am pleased to report  \n  that David Viniar assumed the role of Risk  \n  Chair in the Fall, bringing to bear his     \n  deep financial acumen and broad expertise   \n  across the breadth of the risk spectrum. I  \n  am also happy to share that, upon Mark\u2019s    \n  retirement, Kimberley Harris will become    \n  Chair of our Compensation Committee. In     \n  this new leadership role, Kim will draw     \n  upon her cross-disciplinary perspective,    \n  and public policy and regulatory            \n  expertise, garnered from her range of       \n  experiences acting as a trusted advisor in  \n  both the public and private sectors.With    \n  respect to the firm\u2019s governance beyond     \n  The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. level, I      \n  wanted to highlight several steps that the  \n  Board has taken over the past year to       \n  further strengthen our connection to the    \n  firm\u2019s subsidiary boards. For example, in   \n  February 2023, Peter Oppenheimer assumed    \n  the additional role of chair of the board   \n  of our subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA,  \n  having joined the bank board in August      \n  2022, and, in March, Michele Burns also     \n  joined the board of our U.K. subsidiary,    \n  Goldman Sachs International, replacing      \n  Mark Winkelman. I am grateful to each of    \n  Peter and Michele for taking on these       \n  additional roles to enhance the critical    \n  connectively of our Board to these key      \n  entities.On behalf of my colleagues on the  \n  Board, I am grateful for your ongoing       \n  support. We value your investment in our    \n  firm and our continued engagement, which    \n  informs our work. I look forward to our     \n  ongoing dialogue in the year to             \n  come.Adebayo OgunlesiIndependent Lead       \n  DirectorivGOLDMAN SACHS\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0PROXY\u00a0          \n  STATEMENT\u00a0FOR\u00a0THE\u00a02023\u00a0ANNUAL\u00a0MEETING\u00a0OF\u00a0   \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\u20142023 ANNUAL MEETING         \nINFORMATION Executive Summary This summary    \nhighlights information from our Proxy         \nStatement for the 2023 Annual Meeting.

Our Board has\nestablished a Director Independence Policy    \nthat provides standards to assist our Board in\ndetermining which relationships and           \ntransactions might constitute a material      \nrelationship that would cause a director not  \nto be independent. To assess independence, our\nGovernance Committee and our Board review     \ndetailed information regarding our independent\ndirectors or nominees, including employment   \nand public company and not-for-profit         \ndirectorships, as well as information         \nregarding immediate family members and        \naffiliated entities. Through the course of    \nthis review, our Governance Committee and our \nBoard consider relationships between the      \nindependent directors or nominees (and their  \nimmediate family members and affiliated       \nentities) on the one hand, and Goldman Sachs  \nand its affiliates on the other, in accordance\nwith our Director Independence Policy. This   \nincludes a review of revenues to the firm     \nfrom, and payments or donations made by the   \nfirm to, relevant entities affiliated with our\ndirectors or nominees (or their immediate     \nfamily members) as a result of ordinary course\ntransactions or contributions to not-for-     \nprofit organizations. For more information on \nthe categories of transactions that our       \nGovernance Committee and our Board reviewed,  \nconsidered and determined to be immaterial    \nunder our Director Independence Policy, see   \nAnnex B: Additional Details on Director       \nIndependence. Additional Details Regarding    \nDavid Viniar In connection with succession    \nplanning for the Risk Chair role in light of  \nMr. Winkelman\u2019s upcoming retirement, our Board\nand Governance Committee undertook a robust   \nanalysis of Mr. Viniar\u2019s independence. In     \nSeptember 2022, our Board, upon the           \nrecommendation of our Governance Committee,   \ndetermined that Mr. Viniar was \u201cindependent\u201d  \nwithin the meaning of NYSE rules and our      \nDirector Independence Policy, including the   \nheightened audit committee independence       \nstandards under SEC and NYSE rules. Numerous  \nfactors were considered in reaching this      \nconclusion, including that:                   \n                                              \n  \u220e    Mr. Viniar\u2019s employment at the firm    \n       ended in January 2013;                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Mr. Viniar has not received any        \n       direct compensation from the firm      \n  \u220e    (other than director fees or deferred  \n       compensation for prior service that    \n       is permissible under applicable        \n       rules) since January 2015;             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Mr. Viniar is not an employee of, and  \n       no member of his immediate family is   \n       currently an executive officer of, a   \n       company or not-for-profit              \n  \u220e    organization that has made payments    \n       to, or received payment from, the      \n       firm for property or services in an    \n       amount that exceeded the standards     \n       set forth in the NYSE rules and our    \n       Director Independence Policy; and      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Mr. Viniar\u2019s investments with the      \n       firm are on substantially the same     \n  \u220e    terms and conditions as other          \n       similarly situated investors who are   \n       neither directors nor employees.       \n                                              \n                                              \n  PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2023 ANNUAL         \n  MEETING OF                              17  \n  SHAREHOLDERS | GOLDMAN SACHS                \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\u2014STRUCTURE OF OUR BOARD   \nAND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES OUR BOARD COMMITTEES \nStructure of our Board and Governance         \nPractices                                     \n                        \n  Our Board Committees  \n                        \nOur Board has five standing Committees: Audit,\nCompensation, Governance, Public              \nResponsibilities and Risk.

In        \naddition, our Governance Committee considered \nfeedback on the Chairman of the Board received\nin connection with the Board evaluation. As a \nresult of this review, our Governance         \nCommittee determined that continuing to have  \nMr. Solomon serve as both Chairman and        \nCEO\u2014working together with a strong independent\nLead Director\u2014is the most effective leadership\nstructure for our Board and our firm at this  \ntime. Ultimately, we believe that our current \nleadership structure, together with strong    \ngovernance practices, creates a productive    \nrelationship between our Board and management,\nincluding strong independent oversight that   \nbenefits our shareholders. We will continue to\nconduct Board leadership assessments annually.\nIf at any time our Governance Committee       \ndetermines it would be appropriate to appoint \nan independent Chair, it will not hesitate to \ndo so.                                        \n                               \n  Benefits of a Combined Role  \n                               \n                                              \n       A combined Chair-CEO structure         \n       provides our firm with a senior        \n       leader who serves as a primary         \n  \u220e    liaison between our Board and          \n       management and as a primary public     \n       face of our firm.

The Committee carries out this     \nfunction through an ongoing, year-round       \nprocess, which includes the Committee\u2019s annual\nevaluation of our Board and individual        \ndirector evaluations. Each director and       \ndirector candidate is evaluated by our        \nGovernance Committee based on his or her      \nindividual merits, taking into account our    \nfirm\u2019s needs and the composition of our Board.\nTo assist in this evaluation, the Committee   \nutilizes as a discussion tool a matrix of     \ncertain skills and experiences that would be  \nbeneficial to have represented on our Board   \nand on our Committees at any particular point \nin time. For example, the Committee is focused\non what skills are beneficial for service in  \nkey Board positions, such as Lead Director and\nCommittee Chairs, and conducts a succession   \nplanning process for those positions. Our     \nGovernance Committee welcomes candidates      \nrecommended by shareholders and will consider \nthese candidates in the same manner as other  \ncandidates. Shareholders wishing to submit    \npotential director candidates for             \nconsideration by our Governance Committee     \nshould follow the instructions in Frequently  \nAsked Questions.                              \n                                              \n  PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2023 ANNUAL         \n  MEETING OF                              23  \n  SHAREHOLDERS | GOLDMAN SACHS                \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\u2014STRUCTURE OF OUR BOARD   \nAND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES DIRECTOR EDUCATION   \n                      \n  Director Education  \n                      \nDirector education about our firm and our     \nindustry is an ongoing process that begins    \nwhen a director joins our Board. Upon joining \nour Board, new directors are provided with a  \ncomprehensive orientation about our firm,     \nincluding our business, strategy and          \ngovernance. For example, new directors        \n(including Mr. Johnson during 2022) typically \nmeet with senior leaders covering each of our \nrevenue-producing segments and regions, as    \nwell as with senior leaders from key control, \nfinance and operating functions. New directors\nalso participate in orientation sessions      \ncovering the responsibilities and key areas of\nfocus of the Board and its Committees.        \nAdditional training is also provided when a   \ndirector assumes a leadership role, such as   \nbecoming a Committee Chair. Board and         \nCommittee presentations, roundtables, regular \ncommunications and firm and other industry    \nevents help keep directors appropriately      \napprised of key developments in our businesses\nand in our industry, including material       \nchanges in regulation, so that they can carry \nout their oversight responsibilities          \neffectively.                                  \n                           \n  Commitment of our Board  \n                           \nCommitment of our Directors\u20142022 Meetings Our \nBoard and its Committees met frequently in    \n2022.                                         \n                                              \n                        2022                  \n                    Meetings                  \n  Board                16(a)                  \n                                65            \n                                Total\u00a0Board   \n  Audit                   16    and\u00a0          \n                                Committee     \n                                Meetings in   \n                                2022          \n  Compensati\u2026              8                  \n  Governance               7                  \n  Public                   6                  \n  Responsibi\u2026                                 \n  Risk                    12                  \n  Executive                                   \n  Sessions of                                 \n  Independent              6                  \n  Directors                                   \n  without                                     \n  Management\u2026                                 \n  Additional                                  \n  Executive                                   \n  Sessions of                                 \n  Independent                                 \n  and/or                  13                  \n  Non-Employ\u2026                                 \n  Directors                                   \n  without                                     \n  Management\u2026                                 \n  (a)                                         \n  Includes                                    \n  two                                         \n  meetings of                                 \n  the Board\u2019s                                 \n  1MDB                                        \n  Remediation                                 \n  Special                                     \n  Committee.                                  \n  (b)                                         \n  Chaired by                                  \n  our Lead                                    \n  Director.                                   \n  (c) Led by                                  \n  our Lead                                    \n  Director or                                 \n  other                                       \n  independent                                 \n  Committee                                   \n  Chairs.                                     \n                                              \nEach of our current directors attended over   \n75% (the threshold for disclosure under SEC   \nrules) of the meetings of our Board and the   \nCommittees on which he or she served as a     \nregular member during 2022.

Given the         \n  importance of                               \n  these initiatives and our commitment to     \n  transparency, we felt that our              \n  stakeholders would                          \n  benefit from this type of third party       \n  assessment,                                 \n  the results of which will help inform our   \n  future                                      \n  investment and philanthropic strategies.    \n  We are                                      \n  pleased that WilmerHale found that these    \n  initiatives were \u201cserious and substantial   \n  efforts                                     \n  to promote equity and opportunity for       \n  underserved                                 \n  communities,\u201d that were conceived of and    \n  designed                                    \n  on the basis of rigorous planning,          \n  including                                   \n  \u201c how to deploy  capital and                \n  other resources to reach external           \n  stakeholders                                \n  most effectively.\u201d We reiterate our         \n  ongoing                                     \n  commitment to promoting equity within our   \n  firm,                                       \n  throughout the industry and in the          \n  communities                                 \n  where we work and live.

We believe this balanced        \napproach, which is consistent with industry   \npractice, is appropriate for our firm, and    \nthat a more formulaic compensation program    \nwould not be in the long-term best interests  \nof our firm, our shareholders and other       \nstakeholders.                                 \n                                              \n       Avoids Unintended Consequences and     \n       Mitigates Compensation-Related Risk.   \n       Our business is dynamic and requires   \n       us to respond rapidly to changes in    \n       our operating environment. As such,    \n  \u220e    our annual compensation program is     \n       designed to encourage appropriate      \n       prudence by our senior leaders, on     \n       behalf of our shareholders and our     \n       clients, regardless of prevailing      \n       market conditions.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       We use a Performance Assessment        \n       Framework to provide greater           \n       definition to, and transparency        \n       regarding, the pre-established         \n       financial and nonfinancial factors     \n       considered by the Compensation         \n       Committee to assess the firm\u2019s         \n  \u00bb    performance in connection with         \n       compensation decisions for our NEOs    \n       and other senior leaders. However, a   \n       strictly formulaic compensation        \n       program would not permit adjustments   \n       based on less quantifiable factors,    \n       such as unexpected external events or  \n       individual performance.                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Performance-Based Pay Provides         \n       Alignment.

        \n       Performance is assessed in a holistic  \n       manner and was guided by our           \n       Performance Assessment Framework       \n       (using metrics determined by our       \n       Compensation Committee in February     \n  \u220e    2022), without ascribing specific      \n       weight to any single factor or         \n       metric, as we continue to believe      \n       that a formulaic compensation program  \n       would not be in the best interests of  \n       our firm or our shareholders.          \n                                              \n

considered the comparison  \n       to the firm\u2019s record 2021              \n  \u220e    performance. They also took into       \n       account a variety of other firmwide    \n       and business specific metrics, as      \n       well as the context of the broader     \n       operating environment and the          \n       challenging economic backdrop during   \n       2022.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       In addition, the Committee also        \n       considered how 2022 results were       \n       achieved, including how the firm       \n       continued to\u00a0invest in its future and  \n  \u220e    how each NEO and each business         \n       contributed to the various client,     \n       risk management, and people-related    \n       strategies and goals set forth in the  \n       Framework, including as described in   \n       \u20142022\u00a0Individual Performance.          \n                                              \nThe execution and evolution of the firm\u2019s     \nlong-term growth strategy was also central to \nour Compensation Committee decisions for 2022 \ncompensation.                                 \n                                              \n       Our NEOs, and in particular our        \n       Executive Leadership Team, drove the   \n       continued execution of our strategic\u00a0  \n       plan throughout 2022 and made          \n       important decisions to evolve the      \n       firm\u2019s strategy in line with our\u00a0      \n       long-term goals. While continued       \n  \u220e    progress was made, there is more work  \n       needed to fully realize our            \n       longer-term ambitions. Pursuant to     \n       the Performance Assessment Framework,  \n       the Committee considered progress      \n       towards achieving our strategic goals  \n       in 2022 by reviewing a

In addition,\nour NEOs, non-employeedirectors and all other \nemployees are prohibited from hedging or      \npledging their equity-based awards. Our       \nemployees, other than our executive officers, \nmay hedge only shares of our Common Stock that\nthey can otherwise sell. However, they may not\nenter into uncovered hedging transactions or  \n\u201cshort\u201d sales of our Common Stock.            \nAdditionally, employees may not act on        \ninvestment decisions with respect to our      \nCommon Stock, except during applicable \u201cwindow\nperiods.\u201d The restrictions described above    \nalso generally apply to such individual\u2019s     \nimmediate family, household members and       \ndependents.

For 2022, these individuals each     \nreceived a matching contribution of $12,500.  \nMr. Berlinski has not participated in the U.K.\ndefined contribution arrangement, known as    \nLifeSight (the U.K. Defined Contribution      \nArrangement) since July 2019, when he         \nrelocated on assignment to the U.S. The firm  \nprovides overseas employees who can no longer \nparticipate in the U.K. Defined Contribution  \nArrangement with an annual payment in lieu of \nhis or her participation. The amount of this  \npayment for 2022 for Mr. Berlinski was        \n$21,744, which is approximately equal to the  \nfirm\u2019s annual cost in respect of participation\nin the U.K. Defined Contribution Arrangement. \nPerquisites and Other Benefits Our NEOs       \nreceived in 2022 certain benefits that are    \nconsidered \u201cperquisites\u201d for purposes of the  \nSEC rules regarding compensation disclosure.  \nWhile our Compensation Committee was provided \nwith the estimated value of these items, it   \ndetermined, as in prior years, not to give    \nthese amounts significant consideration in    \ndetermining our NEOs\u2019 2022 variable           \ncompensation.                                 \n                                              \n  PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2023 ANNUAL         \n  MEETING OF                              53  \n  SHAREHOLDERS | GOLDMAN SACHS                \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u2014COMPENSATION DISCUSSION  \nAND ANALYSIS GS GIVES During 2022, we made    \navailable to each of our Executive Leadership \nTeam a car and driver and, in some cases,     \nother services, including for security.

Our NEOs participate in our         \nexecutive medical and dental program and      \nreceive executive life insurance while they   \nremain PMDs. Our NEOs also receive long-term  \ndisability insurance coverage. Our NEOs (and  \ntheir covered dependents) are also eligible   \nfor a retiree healthcare program and receive  \ncertain other perquisites, some of which have \nno incremental cost to us. At our request, Mr.\nColeman relocated from London to our New York \noffice in 2021, and Mr. Berlinski did so in   \n2019. To this end, during 2022, consistent    \nwith our standard Global Mobility Services    \nprograms, Messrs. Coleman and Berlinski       \nreceived international assignment relocation  \nbenefits and tax equalization and/or          \nprotection payments, as applicable, in        \nconnection with their respective arrangements.\nSee \u201cAll Other Compensation\u201d and footnote (e) \nin \u2014 Executive Compensation\u20142022 Summary      \nCompensation Table.

We ask our PMDs\nto make recommendations of not-for-           \nprofitorganizations to receive grants from the\nfirm\u2019s contributions to GS Gives. GS Giveshas \nmade approximately $2.2 billion in grants and \npartnered with over 9,000 not-for-            \nprofitorganizations supporting 140+ countries \naround the world since its inception. Grant   \nrecommendations from our PMDs help to ensure  \nthat GS Givesinvests in a diverse group of    \ncharities that improves the lives of people in\ncommunities around the world. We encourage our\nPMDs to make recommendations of grants to     \norganizations consistent with GS Gives\u2019       \nmission of fostering innovative ideas, solving\neconomic and social issues and enabling       \nprogress in underserved communities globally. \nGS Givesundertakes diligence procedures for   \ndonations and has no obligation to follow     \nrecommendations made to us by our PMDs. In    \n2022, GS Givesaccepted the recommendations of \nover 500 current and retired PMDs and granted \nover $219 million to over 2,800 not-for-      \nprofitorganizations around the world.

We do not      \nconsider these security measures to be        \npersonal benefits but rather business-related \nnecessities due to the high-profile standing  \nof our CEO. Mr. Coleman relocated to our New  \nYork office at our request and, for 2022, Mr. \nColeman received relocation benefits of       \napproximately $443,000 and tax protection     \npayments of approximately $466,000.

In each case,  \nthese benefits and payments were part of our  \nstandard Global Mobility Services programs    \napplicable to relocating employees, and the   \ntax equalization and protection payments were \nintended to cover certain taxes that are over \nand above those that Messrs.

Our policy is to limit personal use \nof such aircraft by our NEOs and to require   \nreimbursement of the aggregate incremental    \ncosts to us associated with such use, as      \npermitted by Federal Aviation regulations. In \nsituations where an NEO brings a personal     \nguest as a passenger on a business-related    \nflight, the NEO pays us an amount equal to the\naggregate incremental cost to us, if any, for \nsuch personal guest.                          \n                                    \n  2022 Grants of Plan-Based Awards  \n                                    \nThe following table sets forth 2021 Year-     \nEndPSUs, 2021 Year-EndU.K. PSUs and 2021 U.K. \nRSUs, as applicable, granted in early 2022, as\nwell as SVC Awards granted in January 2022.

Our GS         \n       Pension Plan provides for early        \n       retirement benefits, and all of our    \n       participating NEOs became or will      \n       become eligible to elect early         \n       retirement benefits upon reaching age  \n       55. Prior to being frozen, our GS      \n  (b)  U.K. Retirement Plan provided for an   \n       annual benefit equal to 1.25% of the   \n       first \u00a381,000 of the participant\u2019s     \n       compensation for each year of          \n       credited service. The normal form of   \n       payment is a single life annuity plus  \n       a contingent spouse\u2019s annuity equal    \n       to two-thirds of the member\u2019s          \n       pension.

The present      \n       value shown in this column reflects    \n       Mr. Berlinski\u2019s accrued benefits with  \n       an annual cost of living adjustment    \n       that is applied pursuant to the terms  \n       of the GS U.K. Retirement Plan and     \n       was determined using the following     \n       assumptions: payment of a joint life   \n       annuity following retirement at        \n       normal retirement age; a 4.89%         \n       discount rate; mortality estimates     \n       based on the \u201cS3 series all pensioner  \n       very light\u201d mortality table, with      \n       adjustments to reflect continued       \n       improvements in mortality; and the GS  \n       U.K. Retirement Plan\u2019s provision of    \n       early retirement benefits in respect   \n       of his second period of service and    \n       Mr. Berlinski\u2019s eligibility to elect   \n       early retirement benefits upon         \n       reaching age 55.                       \n                                              \nFor a description of our 401(k) Plan and our  \nU.K. Defined Contribution Arrangement, which  \nare our tax-qualified defined contribution    \nplans in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, see \n\u2014 Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u2014Other  \nCompensation Policies and Practices.          \n                                            \n  2022 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation  \n                                            \nThe following table sets forth information for\neach NEO, as applicable, with respect to      \nvested RSUs granted for service in prior years\nfor which the underlying shares of Common     \nStock had not yet been delivered during 2022  \n(Vested and Undelivered RSUs).

For information on    \n       the number of PSUs and vested RSUs     \n       held by the NEOs at year-end, see      \n       \u20142022 Outstanding Equity Awards at     \n       Fiscal Year-End and \u20142022              \n       Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation    \n  (b)  above. These amounts do not reflect,   \n       in the case of death, the payment of   \n       a death benefit under our executive    \n       life insurance plan, which provides    \n       each NEO with term life insurance      \n       coverage through age 75 (a $4.5\u00a0       \n       million benefit). In the case of an    \n       NEO\u2019s disability, provided that the    \n       NEO does not become associated with a  \n       Covered Enterprise (except with        \n       respect to Mr. Coleman\u2019s 2021 U.K.     \n       RSUs), unvested RSUs, PSUs or SVC      \n       Awards will vest, shares of Common     \n       Stock underlying RSUs continue to      \n       deliver on schedule and PSUs and SVC   \n       Awards continue to be eligible to be   \n       earned pursuant to their existing      \n       terms. If the NEO does become          \n       associated with a Covered Enterprise,  \n       the awards would be treated as set     \n       forth in footnote (a)\u00a0above for that   \n       situation.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       In the case of a termination in which  \n       an NEO resigns and accepts a position  \n       that is deemed Conflicted Employment   \n       (as defined below), the NEO will       \n       receive, at our sole discretion, with  \n       respect to Year-End RSUs, either a     \n       cash payment or accelerated vesting    \n       (if applicable), delivery of, and      \n       removal of transfer restrictions on,   \n  (c)  the shares of Common Stock underlying  \n       those RSUs and Shares at Risk.         \n       Unvested year-end RSUs will only be    \n       vested if the NEO has completed at     \n       least three years of continuous        \n       service with the firm. Additionally,   \n       in the event of such a termination,    \n       our Compensation Committee may         \n       determine to amend the terms of any    \n       then-outstanding PSUs or SVC Awards    \n       held by the NEO.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Amounts included for SVC Awards        \n       reflect level of achievement against   \n       absolute and relative thresholds,      \n       based on actual performance as of      \n       December\u00a031, 2022. In the event of an  \n       NEO\u2019s termination for Good Reason (as  \n       defined below) or without Cause        \n       within 18 months of a Change in        \n       Control: (i)\u00a0for RSUs, vesting and     \n       delivery of underlying shares of       \n       Common Stock, each as applicable, is   \n       accelerated and any applicable         \n       transfer restrictions are removed;     \n       and (ii)\u00a0for PSUs and SVC Awards,      \n       vesting is accelerated and any         \n       applicable transfer restrictions are   \n       also removed, but delivery and         \n       performance conditions do not change.  \n       For RSUs and Shares at Risk delivered  \n       in respect of SVC Awards, PSUs and     \n       RSUs, certain forfeiture provisions    \n       no longer apply. For SVC Awards, in    \n       the case of a change of control that   \n       results in a delisting, the change in  \n       control would be deemed to be the      \n  (d)  last day of the performance period.    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nRetiree Healthcare In the case of a           \ntermination for Cause, the present value of   \npremiums for our retiree healthcare program   \nwould be $0 for each of our NEOs. In the case \nof a termination of employment for any other  \nreason, the present value of such premiums is:\nMr. Solomon \u2013 $294,185, Mr. Waldron \u2013         \n$397,556, Mr. Coleman \u2013 $452,453, Mr.         \nBerlinski \u2013 $481,051 and Ms. Ruemmler \u2013 $0. In\n2022, PMDs with eight or more years of PMD    \nservice were eligible to receive medical and  \ndental coverage under our retiree healthcare  \nprogram for themselves and eligible           \ndependents. The 2022 healthcare program       \nprovided a subsidy equal to 100% of the       \nindividual premium for current retirees with  \neight years of PMD service and active PMDs who\nretire with eight years of PMD service. Any   \nelected coverage for spouses/partners or      \ndependents is not subsidized by the firm. New \nPMDs promoted or hired on or after January 1, \n2021, will not receive a firm subsidy toward  \nretiree healthcare and will be required to pay\n100% of the retiree medical premium. Each of  \nour NEOs (other than Ms. Ruemmler) is eligible\nfor subsidized coverage; Ms. Ruemmler is      \neligible to receive access to the retiree     \nhealthcare program at full cost with no firm  \nsubsidy. The values provided above reflect the\npresent value of the cost to us of the 100%   \nindividual subsidy starting in 2023 and were  \ndetermined using a December 31, 2022          \nretirement date and the following assumptions:\na 5.27% discount rate; mortality estimates    \nbased on the PRI-2012white collar fully       \ngenerational mortality table, with adjustments\nto reflect continued improvements in mortality\nbased on Scale MP-2021;estimates of future    \nincreases in healthcare subsidy costs of 6.00%\npre-65,6.50% post-65and then grading down     \n0.25% per year until ultimate rate of 4.50%   \nfor medical and pharmacy and 4.00% for dental;\nand assumptions for subsequent eligibility for\nalternative coverage, which would eliminate   \nsubsidies under our program (60% firm         \nsubsidized and 40% not firm subsidized). If an\nNEO becomes associated with certain entities, \nincluding certain Covered Enterprises, the NEO\nwill forfeit some or all of his or her        \nbenefits and/or coverage under our retiree    \nhealthcare program. Other Terms As PMDs and   \nmembers of the Management Committee, our NEOs \nare generally subject to a policy of six      \nmonths\u2019 notice of termination of employment.  \nWe may require that an NEO be inactive (i.e., \non \u201cgarden leave\u201d) during the notice period   \n(or we may waive the requirement).            \n                                              \n  PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2023 ANNUAL         \n  MEETING OF                              63  \n  SHAREHOLDERS | GOLDMAN SACHS                \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u2014EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION   \nPOTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE \nIN CONTROL For purposes of describing our     \nPSUs, RSUs and the SVC Awards, the above-     \nreferenced terms generally have the following \nmeanings: \u201c Cause\u201d means the NEO (a) is       \nconvicted in a criminal proceeding on certain \nmisdemeanor charges, on a felony charge or an \nequivalent charge;

Paying-for-         \nperformanceis a key element of our            \nCompensation Principles and our approach to   \nexecutive compensation. As detailed in our \u2014  \nCompensation Discussion and Analysisabove, the\nCompensation Committee places substantial     \nimportance on the assessment of firmwide      \nperformance when determining NEO compensation.\nTo this end, the Committee utilizes the       \nPerformance Assessment Framework to assess a  \nvariety of financial and nonfinancial measures\nin applying its informed judgment to evaluate \nand set annual pay amounts. See \u2014 Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis\u20142022 Annual           \nCompensation. We believe that the structure of\nour equity-based awards provides an intrinsic \nlink to the firm\u2019s longer-term performance.   \nThrough the use of PSUs, the amounts          \nultimately realized by our NEOs with respect  \nto annual compensation are subject to ongoing \nperformance metrics (absolute and relative    \nROE) and are further tied to the firm\u2019s       \nlonger-term performance through stock price   \n(settlement of PSUs and Shares at Risk        \ndelivered in respect thereof).

Cook & Co., Inc. (FW Cook), a     \ncompensation consultant, to conduct an        \nindependent review of our Director            \nCompensation Program. FW Cook assessed the    \nstructure of our Director Compensation Program\nand its value compared to competitive market  \npractices, taking into account the emphasis on\nequity compensation, the hold-through         \nretirement requirement and other restrictions \non the RSUs, as well as the August 2020       \nresolution of the director compensation       \nlitigation and the fixed amount of annual     \ndirector compensation specified in the SIP,   \nwhich was approved by our shareholders at the \n2021 Annual Meeting. FW Cook determined that  \nthe Director Compensation Program remained    \ncompetitive with the market and continued to  \nalign the interests of our directors with the \nlong-term interests of our shareholders. Our  \nGovernance Committee determined that FW Cook  \nis independent and has no conflicts of        \ninterest in providing services to our         \nGovernance Committee.                         \n                                            \n  2022 Director Summary Compensation Table  \n                                            \nThe following table sets forth the            \ncompensation for our directors as determined  \nby SEC rules, which require us to include     \nequity awards granted during2022 and cash     \ncompensation earned for2022. Historically, we \nhave granted equity-based awards to our       \ndirectors for a particular year shortly after \nthat year\u2019s end. While we continue this       \npractice for the Annual Grant RSUs, beginning \nin 2021 we started granting RSUs in respect of\nthe Annual Retainer and/or Committee Chair Fee\nquarterly in arrears (to more closely align   \nwith timing of cash payments, providing       \nperiodic grants and payments over the course  \nof the year and in alignment with market      \npractice).

Both \u201cdirect and indirect\nlobbying\u201d and \u201cgrassroots lobbying            \ncommunications\u201d include efforts at the local, \nstate and federal levels. The report shall be \npresented to the Public Responsibilities      \nCommittee and posted on Goldman\u2019s website.    \nSupporting Statement Goldman spent $41 million\nfrom 2010 \u2014 2021 on federal lobbying. This    \ndoes not include state lobbying, where Goldman\nalso lobbies. Goldman also lobbies abroad,    \nspending between \u20ac800,000 \u2014 899,999 on        \nlobbying in Europe for 2021 and previously    \ndrawing scrutiny. for \u201callegedly trying to    \nlobby members of the European Commission.\u201d 1  \nCompanies can give unlimited amounts to third \nparty groups that spend millions on lobbying  \nand undisclosed grassroots activity. These    \ngroups may be spending \u201cat least double what\u2019s\npublicly reported.\u201d 2Goldman fails to disclose\nits memberships in or payments to trade       \nassociations and social welfare organizations,\nor the amounts used for lobbying, to          \nshareholders. Goldman belongs to the American \nBankers Association (ABA), Business           \nRoundtable, Financial Service Forum (FSF),    \nManaged Funds Association and Securities      \nIndustry and Financial Markets Association,   \nwhich together spent $55 million on lobbying  \nfor 2021. Goldman\u2019s lack of disclosure        \npresents reputational risks when its lobbying \ncontradicts company public positions. For     \nexample, Goldman publicly supports addressing \nclimate change, yet the Business Roundtable   \nopposed the Inflation Reduction Act and its   \nhistoric investments in climate action 3and   \nFSF lobbied the Securities and Exchange       \nCommission to weaken proposed climate         \ndisclosure rules. 4And while Goldman does not \nbelong to or support the American Legislative \nExchange Council, which is attacking \u201cwoke    \ncapitalism,\u201d 5one of its trade associations   \ndoes, as ABA supported its 2022 annual        \nmeeting. 6According to the 2022 Harris        \nCorporate Reputation Survey, Goldman ranked   \n80\u201d of the 100 most visible US companies. 7   \nReputational damage stemming from these       \nmisalignments could harm shareholder value,   \nand I urge Goldman to expand its lobbying     \ndisclosure.                                   \n                                              \n  (1)  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/21/gold\u2026  \n       brusselslobbying.html.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  (2)  https://theintercept.com/2019/08/06    \n       /business-group-spending-on-lobbying\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  (3)  https://www.theguardian.com/environm\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  (4)  https://www.eenews.net/articles/bank\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n       https://www                            \n  (5)  exposedbycmd.org/2022/07/27/abandoni\u2026  \n       bodilyautonomy-and-more-at-its-annua\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  (6)  https://documented.net/investigation\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  (7)  https://www.axios.com/2022/05/24/202\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2023 ANNUAL         \n  MEETING OF                              79  \n  SHAREHOLDERS | GOLDMAN SACHS                \n                                              \nITEMS 5-12.SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS              \n                             \n  Directors\u2019 Recommendation  \n                             \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE       \nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. Our         \nStatement on Policy Engagement and Political  \nParticipation (our Policy Statement, available\non our website through www.gs.com/corpgov )   \nand our existing public disclosures already   \naddress the most material requests in the     \nproposal. Preparing the report requested by   \nthe proposal would impose an additional       \nadministrative burden on our firm without     \nproviding material new information to our     \nshareholders. Furthermore, additional         \ndisclosure may also raise potential           \ncompetitive and business-related concerns.

Separating    \n       the chair and CEO positions reduces    \n       this conflict, and an independent      \n       chair provides the clearest            \n       separation of power between the CEO    \n       and the rest of the board.\u201d            \n                                              \n                                              \n  PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2023 ANNUAL         \n  MEETING OF                              81  \n  SHAREHOLDERS | GOLDMAN SACHS                \n                                              \nITEMS 5-12.

In fact, our policies require that \nif at any time our Chair is not independent,  \nwe must have an independent Lead Director.    \nFurthermore, as we have repeatedly disclosed, \nour Board will not hesitate to appoint an     \nindependent Chair if at any time our          \nGovernance Committee concludes it would be    \nappropriate to do so.Accordingly, and taking  \ninto account that a similar proposal at our   \n2022 Annual Meeting was supported by only     \napproximately 16% of the votes cast at that   \nmeeting, we believe that the adoption of this \nproposal is unnecessary and not in the best   \ninterests of our firm or our shareholders.    \n                                              \n       Pursuant to our Corporate Governance   \n       Guidelines, our independent            \n       Governance Committee assesses and      \n  \u220e    deliberates the merits of our          \n       leadership structure to help ensure    \n       that the most efficient and            \n       appropriate structure is in place; it  \n       has done so annually since 2011.       \n                                              \n                                              \n     This annual review process provides our  \n     Board with the necessary flexibility to  \n     make the appropriate determination       \n     about how our Board\u2019s leadership should  \n  \u00bb  be structured most effectively for our   \n     firm\u2019s needs, which may evolve over      \n     time.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS Supporting  \nStatement:The Company\u2019s 2021 Sustainability   \nReport touts its socially responsible goals   \nand achievements. 1In doing so, it advertises \nCompany\u2019s policies and practices that it says \nprioritize its commitment to human rights and \npreventing modern slavery and human           \ntrafficking. 2 But nothing about supporting   \nbusiness in China, which is controlled by the \ndictatorial and inhumane Chinese Communist    \nParty (CCP), does anything to further these   \nideals. The Chinese government has an         \nabhorrent human rights record, as witnessed by\nits abuses against the Uyghurs and other      \nethnic minorities in Xinjiang, including      \nforced labor programs, forced sterilizations, \nand torture. 3Chinese authorities perpetrate  \ngenocide and use emerging technologies to     \ncarry out discriminatory surveillance and     \nethno-racial profiling measures designed to   \nsubjugate and exploit minority populations. 4 \nThis poor human rights record makes China\u2019s   \nincreasingly aggressive stance toward Taiwan  \neven more alarming, as it makes claims of     \nsovereignty over the island. It has recently  \nsent warplanes towards the territory\u2019s air    \ndefense zone, and has called for Taiwan\u2019s     \n\u201creunification\u201d with China, stoking fears and \ngeopolitical instability. 5 The Company       \nnonetheless conducts a significant amount of  \nbusiness in China, investing in companies     \nthrough the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta Emerging \nMarkets Equity ETF (GEM). GEM, which has      \nhundreds of millions of assets under          \nmanagement, effectively funds the CCP\u2019s       \noppressive military companies. These include  \ncompanies such as the China National Nuclear  \nCorporation (CNNC), 6which oversees the CCP\u2019s \nnuclear weapons program, and Dongfeng Motor   \nGroup, 7which builds tactical vehicles for the\nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army. The CNNC was even   \ndesignated by the Pentagon at one point as a  \nCommunist Chinese military company, in        \naccordance with its obligations under the     \nNational Defense Authorization Act to         \nhighlight the CCP\u2019s military-civil fusion     \nstrategy. 8 Goldman Sachs invests in these CCP\ndriven companies despite the Chinese regime   \ncommitting genocide against ethnic minorities \nand threatening military action against the   \ngovernment of Taiwan \u2013 actions that run       \ncounter to everything that the Company\u2019s      \nsustainability and other reports says the     \ncompany stands for.

Item 8. Shareholder Proposal        \nRegarding a Racial Equity Audit The Service   \nEmployees International Union Master Trust,   \n1800 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Suite 301,        \nWashington, D.C. 20036, beneficial owner of at\nleast $2,000 in market value of the company\u2019s \nCommon Stock for at least three years, is the \nproponent of the following shareholder        \nproposal. The proponent has advised us that a \nrepresentative will present the proposal and  \nrelated supporting statement at our Annual    \nMeeting.                                      \n                         \n  Proponent\u2019s Statement  \n                         \nRESOLVED that shareholders of Goldman Sachs   \nGroup, Inc. (\u201cGoldman\u201d) urge the Board of     \nDirectors to oversee an independent racial    \nequity audit analyzing Goldman\u2019s adverse      \nimpacts on nonwhite stakeholders and          \ncommunities of color and the steps Goldman    \nplans to take to mitigate such impacts. Input \nfrom civil rights organizations, employees,   \nand customers should be considered in         \ndetermining the specific matters to be        \nanalyzed. A report on the audit, prepared at  \nreasonable cost and omitting confidential or  \nproprietary information, should be publicly   \ndisclosed on Goldman\u2019s website. SUPPORTING    \nSTATEMENT High-profile police killings of     \nblack people have galvanized the movement for \nracial justice. That movement, together with  \nthe disproportionate impacts of the pandemic, \nhave focused the attention of the media, the  \npublic and policy makers on systemic racism,  \nracialized violence and racial inequities.    \nGoldman touts its $10 million Fund for Racial \nEquity \u201cto support the vital work of leading  \norganizations addressing racial injustice,    \nstructural inequity and economic disparity\u201d   \nand the $17 million it \u201cdeployed\u201d to          \n\u201corganizations supporting [COVID-19]relief    \nefforts in communities of color.\u201d 1But        \nGoldman\u2019s own diversity and inclusion record  \nis subpar. According to its EEO-1report, while\nBlack workers make up 7.4% of Goldman\u2019s U.S.  \nworkforce; only 2.9% of senior managers and   \n3.1% of lower level managers are Black; the   \nproportion of Black senior managers declined  \nbetween the 2020 and 2021 People Strategy     \nReports. 2A viral June 2020 email from a Black\nmanaging director stated: \u201c[W]hile our firm   \nexpresses a commitment to equality and social \njustice up top, [junior colleagues] don\u2019t     \nnecessarily see commitment and support from   \ntheir direct managers.\u201d 3 Goldman\u2019s proxy     \nvoting is misaligned with its stated          \ncommitment to racial equity. Of 14 large asset\nmanagers whose 2022 proxy voting records were \nanalyzed by Majority Action, Goldman opposed  \nmore racial equity audit proposals than any   \nmanager besides Vanguard.                     \n                                              \n  PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2023 ANNUAL         \n  MEETING OF                              85  \n  SHAREHOLDERS | GOLDMAN SACHS                \n                                              \nITEMS 5-12. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS Goldman     \nunderwrites municipal bonds whose proceeds pay\npolice brutality settlements. Goldman was lead\nunderwriter for a 2017 Chicago offering that  \nallocated $225 million for settlements and    \njudgments and a 2020 refunding bond intended  \nto \u201cplug[] a huge hole\u201d in the Chicago budget,\n4including a $90 million increase in the      \namount appropriated for settlements and       \njudgments. 5One report characterized these    \nbonds as \u201ca transfer of wealth from over-     \npoliced communities of color to Wall Street   \nand wealthy investors.\u201d 6 Goldman\u2019s           \nphilanthropy fund has donated to the Los      \nAngeles, New York City, Houston and other     \npolice foundations, 7and Goldman Sachs Asset  \nManagement co-chairedthe New York City police \nfoundation\u2019s 2019 annual gala. 8Police        \nfoundations buy equipment for police          \ndepartments, including surveillance technology\nthat has been used to target communities of   \ncolor and nonviolent protestors.

We share the\nproponent\u2019s focus on advancing racial equity. \nBringing diverse people, perspectives and     \nabilities to Goldman Sachs is imperative for  \nour organization to best serve our            \nstakeholders, and we regularly engage with our\nBoard on this issue. We have long been        \ncommitted to promoting inclusion, diversity   \nand equity within our own firm, throughout our\nindustry and in the communities in which we   \nlive and work. Our efforts to bridge gaps in  \ninequality are ongoing. As a firm focused on  \nsustainable and inclusive growth, we are      \nchanneling the power of capital to drive      \neconomic prosperity for more people, and we   \ncontinue to partner with our clients to find  \ncommercial solutions that can make a positive \nimpact on the social and civic challenges in  \nour communities. We also believe that         \ndiversity is core to our ability to serve our \nclients well and to maximize returns for our  \nshareholders, and we have set forth           \naspirational diversity goals to help enhance  \ndiversity in our organization. Over the past  \nseveral years, we have continued to strengthen\nour established racial equity-related         \ninitiatives and taken actions to encourage    \nopen dialogue, assess our shortcomings and    \nenhance our diversity and inclusion efforts to\nhelp create lasting change both at our firm   \nand within our communities. In particular, in \n2022 we engaged the law firm Wilmer Cutler    \nPickering Hale and Dorr LLP (WilmerHale),     \nwhich has expertise in conducting racial      \nequity audits and other assessments of civil  \nrights impact for clients in financial        \nservices and other industries, to examine and \nreport on the effectiveness of several        \ninitiatives, as described below. In light of  \nthe actions we have taken and our continued   \ncommitment to these important issues, we      \nbelieve that the adoption of this proposal is \nunnecessary and not in the best interests of  \nour firm or our shareholders.                 \n                                              \n       We have long focused on providing      \n       access to capital and resources to     \n       minority-owned small businesses and    \n       other underserved communities through  \n  \u220e    our commercial and philanthropic       \n       activity.

According to scientific         \nconsensus, limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C means    \nthat the world cannot develop new oil and gas \nfields or coal mines beyond those already     \napproved (new fossil fuel exploration and     \ndevelopment). 2Furthermore, existing fossil   \nfuel supplies are sufficient to satisfy global\nenergy needs. 3New oil and gas fields would   \nnot produce in time to mitigate current energy\nmarket turmoil resulting from the Ukraine War.\n4 Goldman Sachs (GS) has committed to align   \nits financing with the goals of the Paris     \nAgreement, 5achieving net-zeroemissions by    \n2050, consistent with limiting global warming \nto 1.5\u00b0C. 6However, GS\u2019 current policies and  \npractices are not net-zeroaligned. GS is among\nthe world\u2019s largest funders of fossil fuels,  \nproviding $119 billion in lending and         \nunderwriting to fossil fuel companies during  \n2016-2021, including $44 billion to 100 top   \ncompanies engaged in new fossil fuel          \nexploration and development. 7 Without a      \npolicy to phase out financing of new fossil   \nfuel exploration and development, GS is       \nunlikely to meet its climate commitments and  \nmerits scrutiny for material risks that may   \ninclude:                                      \n                                              \n       Greenwashing: Banking and securities   \n       regulators are tightening and          \n  \u2022    enforcing greenwashing regulations,    \n       which could result in major fines and  \n       settlements.8                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Regulation: Central banks, including   \n       the Fed, are starting to implement     \n       climate stress tests9 and scenario     \n  \u2022    analyses,10 and some have begun to     \n       propose increased capital              \n       requirements for banks\u2019 climate        \n       risks.11                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Competition: Dozens of global banks    \n  \u2022    have adopted policies to phase out     \n       financial support for new oil and gas  \n       fields12 and coal mines.13             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Reputation: Campaigns targeting GS\u2019    \n       climate policies include hundreds of   \n  \u2022    organizations with tens of millions    \n       of global members and supporters,      \n       including current and potential GS     \n       customers.14                           \n                                              \nBy exacerbating climate change, GS is         \nincreasing systemic risk, which will have     \nsignificant negative impacts \u2013 including      \nphysical risks and transition risks 15\u2013 for   \nitself and for diversified investors.

Goldman     \nSachs has long been committed to providing    \ninnovative, commercial solutions for our      \nclients to address and manage climate-related \nrisk and accelerate the climate transition. We\nview climate transition as a key driver of    \nboth risk and opportunity, and we have been   \ninnovating and expanding our commercial       \ncapabilities to help our clients navigate the \ntransition. We do not believe that committing \nto a time-bound phase out of our financing and\nunderwriting activity in hard-to-abatesectors,\nwhich critically need both our engagement and \nour capital, is in the best interests of our  \nshareholders, clients or communities. We do   \nnot believe in placing limits on financing to \nproducers because, among other things, we do  \nnot believe it will result in either reduction\nin emissions from, or demand for, fossil      \nfuels. In June 2021, our Global Investment    \nResearch group estimated that $56 trillion in \nincremental infrastructure investment is      \nneeded to achieve net zero carbon emissions by\n2050. Recent global events have underscored   \nhow energy resilience, security and           \ndiversification are critical components to    \ndrive broader transition to a lower-carbon    \neconomy. Climate transition will require      \nthoughtful public policy that strikes a       \nbalance between current energy capabilities   \nand support for new technology. Even research \nmodels published by the Intergovernmental     \nPanel on Climate Change and others do not     \nassume a complete phase out of fossil fuels by\n2050; rather, they assume some form of        \nabatement, whether through carbon capture and \nstorage or other carbon dioxide removal       \nmethods to counterbalance residual GHG        \nemissions. Given our significant investment in\ndecarbonization and transition finance        \ncapabilities, we believe our shareholders,    \nclients and communities are better served by  \nour engagement, not our divestment. As a      \nresult, and taking into account that a similar\nproposal at our 2022 Annual Meeting was       \nsupported by only approximately 11% of the    \nvotes cast at the meeting, we believe that the\nadoption of this proposal is unnecessary and  \nnot in the best interests of our firm or our  \nshareholders, and it would undermine our role \nin the low carbon transition.                 \n                                              \n       Goldman Sachs has a long-standing      \n       commitment to address the impacts of   \n       climate change and accelerate the      \n       transition to a low-carbon economy.    \n       Since our initial Environmental        \n  \u220e    Policy Framework in 2005, we have      \n       accelerated our efforts to integrate   \n       sustainability across our business,    \n       prioritizing climate transition and    \n       inclusive growth in our commercial     \n       efforts with clients.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       We see finance and innovation playing  \n       an important role in supporting the    \n       climate transition for companies in    \n       the hardest-to-abate sectors, which    \n       need strategic advice and capital to   \n  \u220e    invest in innovative technologies not  \n       yet deployable at commercial scale     \n       and shift to lower-carbon sources,     \n       while also helping to enable           \n       continued supply of affordable,        \n       reliable energy. For example:          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Our commercial capabilities include      \n     climate transition financing, offsite    \n  \u00bb  and on-site renewable power              \n     procurement, commodity risk management   \n     strategies, carbon offset purchases and  \n     climate-related investments; and         \n                                              \n                                              \n     We also launched Carbon Portfolio        \n     Analytics on Marquee, which helps        \n     clients measure and manage their carbon  \n     footprint.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS Supporting  \nStatement: The Intergovernmental Panel on     \nClimate Change (IPCC) has advised that        \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must be halved \nby 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 to limit   \nglobal warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Every incremental    \nincrease in temperature above 1.5\u00b0C will      \nentail increasingly severe physical,          \ntransition, and systemic risks to companies,  \ninvestors, the markets, and the economy as a  \nwhole. Climate change mitigation is therefore \ncritical to address investment risks in order \nto avert the large economic losses projected  \nto occur if insufficient action is taken.     \nAccording to the International Energy Agency, \ntransformation of the Oil and Gas and Power   \nGeneration sectors are critical to reaching   \nthe global goal of keeping temperature rise   \nbelow 1.5\u00b0C, and are therefore significant to \nGoldman\u2019s climate-risk mitigation strategy.   \nGoldman should adopt absolute emission targets\nin these sectors to protect the Company and   \nits long-term investors. Though the Company   \nhas a commitment to reach net zero emissions  \nby 2050 and a target to reduce GHG emissions  \nintensity of the Oil and Gas and Power        \nGeneration sectors by 2030, it does not yet   \nhave a science-based 2030 target to reduce    \nthese GHG emissions on an absolute basis.     \nIntensity targets will measure the reduction  \nin emissions per unit or per dollar, however, \nby definition, they will not capture whether  \nGoldman\u2019s total financed GHG emissions have   \ndecreased in the real world. Rather, we       \nbelieve the Company should consider target-   \nsetting approaches used by advisory groups    \nsuch as the Science Based Targets initiative. \nSuch an absolute reduction target aligned with\na science-based net zero emissions pathway is \ncritical for the Company to achieve its net-  \nzerocommitment and more fully address its     \nclimate risks. Goldman trails its peers in    \nsetting absolute GHG emissions reduction      \ntargets. Citigroup has committed to reducing  \nits absolute emissions for the energy sector  \nby 29% by 2030, stating \u201cabsolute reduction is\nrequired to meet net zero goals and is the    \nmost transparent target selection.\u201d 2Wells    \nFargo has set a target to reduce absolute     \nemissions for the oil and gas sector by 26% by\n2030. Other banks setting absolute reduction  \ngoals for the oil and gas sector include HSBC \n(34%), Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generale (30%), BBVA (30%), and\nDeutsche Bank (23%). By setting absolute      \ntargets in addition to its intensity targets  \nin the energy sector, the Company can ensure  \nit is moving toward its stated commitments and\nreal-economy emissions reductions.

An intensity-based      \n     approach improves comparability across   \n     clients in our portfolio;                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Allowing for growth in businesses that   \n     are emissions-efficient: Intensity       \n     based targets reward efficiency without  \n     penalizing growth. This is particularly  \n  \u00bb  relevant for sectors like Power where    \n     production is expected to increase       \n     significantly over the decade, in line   \n     with science-based decarbonization       \n     pathways; and                            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Reducing volatility as a result of       \n     short-term changes in production         \n     levels: For example, global emissions    \n     fell in 2020 due to a slowdown in        \n     production and reduced demand for        \n     end-use fossil fuels during the          \n  \u00bb  COVID-19 pandemic. Emissions have        \n     rebounded as reopening policies take     \n     hold around the world. An                \n     intensity-based approach normalizes for  \n     volatility like this in emissions        \n     caused by macro events rather than true  \n     decarbonization.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       We will publish an updated TCFD        \n       report later this year that will       \n  \u220e    demonstrate our progress towards our   \n       climate-related goals and              \n       commitments.                           \n                                              \nFor more information on our sustainability    \nefforts, see Spotlight on Sustainability.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS The United  \nNations has recommended that financial        \ninstitution transition plans demonstrate how  \nall parts of the business align with interim  \ntargets and long-term net zero targets 2.     \nOther guidelines exist to help financial      \ninstitutions operationalize and translate net \nzero commitments into strategies \u201cwith        \nspecific objectives . . . against which       \nprogress can be assessed.\u201d 3, 4 Goldman Sachs \nis one of the top 15 global financers of      \nfossil fuels, with $17 billion in fossil fuel \nfinancing in 2021, and nearly $118 billion    \nbetween 2016 through 2021. 5 Goldman is a     \nmember of the NZBA and has announced a Net    \nZero by 2050 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)   \nreduction goal for its financed emissions. It \nalso has set 2030 intensity reduction targets \nfor the oil and gas, power, and auto          \nmanufacturing sectors. To achieve these goals,\nGoldman states that it is \u201cexpanding its      \ncommercial capabilities to help clients       \nmeasure and manage their climate-related      \nexposure\u201d; \u201cdeveloping new financing tools    \ntied to progress on climate transition\u201d; and  \ninvesting in \u201cclimate solutions and emerging  \ntechnologies\u201d for hard to abate sectors\u201d      \nincluding a ten-year,$750 billion commitment  \nto sustainable finance. 6 While the described \nactions will help clients manage and reduce   \ntheir emissions, they do not demonstrate a    \nconcrete transition plan for how Goldman will \nachieve its 2030 sectoral reduction targets.  \nAn effective transition plan creates          \naccountability by describing the indicators,  \nmilestones, metrics, and timelines necessary  \nto deliver on its decarbonization targets and \nensure investors that it is accountable for   \nreducing its financed emissions in alignment  \nwith its 2030 targets. A transition plan might\ninclude, for example, disclosure of clients\u2019  \nestimated annual reductions and how the bank  \nplans to achieve remaining emissions          \nreductions. Other elements of such a plan     \nmight include client and employee incentives  \nor disincentives; setting mandatory actions,  \nincluding loan approval guidelines, investment\nand underwriting priorities, or prohibitions; \nand developing policies or guidelines that    \notherwise restrict, limit, or condition bank  \nbusiness activities, along with expected      \nassociated reductions from each.              \n                                              \n  (1)  https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-bank\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  (2)  https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/\u2026  \n       p.21-22                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  (3)  https://www.iigcc.org/media/2022/07/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  (4)  https://assets.bbhub.io/company/site\u2026  \n       -the-Financial-Sector_June2022.pdf     \n                                              \n                                              \n  (5)  https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploa\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  (6)  https://www.goldmansachs.com/acceler\u2026  \n       p. 4                                   \n                                              \n                             \n  Directors\u2019 Recommendation  \n                             \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE       \nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL.

We also  \n       provide significant detail on the      \n       development of our metrics and         \n       targets and the implementation         \n       thereof.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n     For example, we have developed a new     \n     and unique cross-firm decarbonization    \n     offering that includes a full suite of   \n  \u00bb  tools to help our corporate clients      \n     develop and execute on their             \n     climate-related strategies, including    \n     renewable energy and carbon offset       \n     procurement.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n     At the same time, we recognize that      \n     different geographies, industries and    \n     even clients within each industry are    \n     at different stages of their             \n  \u00bb  decarbonization journey, and we must be  \n     able to tailor solutions to each         \n     geography, industry and client           \n     depending on where they are in their     \n     path to net zero emissions.              \n                                              \n                                              \n     As a global financial institution, we    \n     regularly assess and manage the risks    \n     posed by climate change to our business  \n     through proprietary models that          \n  \u00bb  leverage the latest science and          \n     industry best practices on stress        \n     testing, and we are further integrating  \n     climate into our firmwide business and   \n     risk practices more broadly.             \n                                              \n                                              \n     In addition to ongoing reporting to the  \n     market and our stakeholders, we intend   \n     to use our targets to inform business    \n     strategy. Our efforts to baseline the    \n     in-scope portfolios and estimate our     \n     2030 targets required detailed           \n     client-level analysis, and these         \n  \u00bb  reviews were conducted collaboratively   \n     with subject matter experts across the   \n     firm. This granular analysis will        \n     inform our engagement with clients on    \n     their decarbonization efforts. Over      \n     time, we aim to further embed these      \n     targets into our risk management         \n     framework.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       We also recognize the importance of    \n       providing continued transparency with  \n       respect to our climate transition. To  \n       this end, we will publish an updated   \n  \u220e    TCFD report later this year that will  \n       demonstrate our progress towards our   \n       sectoral targets and provide           \n       additional details of how we are       \n       integrating climate-related            \n       measurements across our business.      \n                                              \n                                              \n     We seek to balance the demand for        \n     updated information with the             \n     availability of updated data to ensure   \n     that our updates provide meaningful and  \n     new information to our stakeholders. To  \n  \u00bb  this end, we have been focused on the    \n     availability of 2021 emissions and       \n     production data from our vendors and     \n     providers, after which we will conduct   \n     our internal measurement and review      \n     process.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     We are also working on automating and    \n     standardizing the emissions reporting    \n     process to allow for more frequent,      \n     recurring reporting of our portfolio     \n     intensity versus our stated targets.     \n  \u00bb  This includes creating infrastructure    \n     across our businesses to provide         \n     real-time visibility into changes in     \n     portfolio intensity metrics and to       \n     support client engagement, which will    \n     provide further accountability in        \n     meeting our 2030 reduction targets.      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Going forward, we intend to provide      \n     updated disclosure on an annual basis.   \n  \u00bb  We have also committed to expand our     \n     targets into additional sectors by the   \n     end of 2024.                             \n                                              \nFor more information on our sustainability    \nefforts, see Spotlight on Sustainability.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS             \nResolved:James McRitchie of CorpGov.net and   \nother shareholders, requests the Golden Sachs \nGroup, Inc. (\u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cGolden Sachs\u201d)     \nreport annually on unadjusted median and      \nadjusted pay gaps across race and gender      \nglobally and/ or by country, where            \nappropriate, including associated policy,     \nreputational, competitive, and operational    \nrisks, and risks related to recruiting and    \nretaining diverse talent. The report should be\nprepared at reasonable cost, omitting         \nproprietary information, litigation strategy, \nand legal compliance information.             \nRacial/gender pay gaps are the difference     \nbetween non-minorityand minority/male and     \nfemale median earnings expressed as a         \npercentage of non-minority/maleearnings.      \nSupporting Statement:Pay inequities persist   \nacross race and gender. They pose substantial \nrisks to companies and society. Black workers\u2019\nhourly median earnings represent 64% of white \nwages. Median income for women working full   \ntime is 83% of that of men. 1Intersecting     \nrace, Black women earn 63%, Native women 60%, \nand Latina women 55%. 2At the current rate,   \nwomen will not reach pay equity until 2059,   \nBlack women 2130, and Latina women 2224. 3    \nCitigroup estimated closing minority and      \ngender wage gaps 20 years ago could have      \ngenerated 12 trillion dollars in additional   \nnational income. 4PwC estimates closing the   \ngender pay gap could boost OECD economies by  \n$2 trillion annually. 5Actively managing pay  \nequity is linked to superior stock performance\nand return on equity. 6 Best practice         \nincludes:                                     \n                                              \n      unadjusted median pay gaps, assessing   \n  1.  equal opportunity to high-paying        \n      roles,                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      statistically adjusted gaps, assessing  \n  2.  whether minorities and non-minorities,  \n      men and women, are paid the same for    \n      similar roles.                          \n                                              \nOver 20 percent of the 100 largest U.S.       \nemployers currently report adjusted gaps, and \nan increasing number of companies disclose    \nunadjusted gaps to address the structural bias\nwomen and minorities face regarding job       \nopportunity and pay. 7Golden Sachs reports    \nneither. Racial and gender unadjustedmedian   \npay gaps are accepted as the valid way of     \nmeasuring pay inequity by the United States   \nCensus Bureau, Department of Labor, OECD, and \nInternational Labor Organization. 8The United \nKingdom and Ireland mandate disclosure of     \nmedian pay gaps, and the United Kingdom is    \nconsidering racial pay reporting.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS             \n                             \n  Directors\u2019 Recommendation  \n                             \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE       \nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. At Goldman  \nSachs, we have long been committed to         \npromoting diversity, equity and inclusion as a\nkey business imperative. Diversity is core to \nour ability to serve our clients well and to  \nmaximize returns for our shareholders. A      \ndiverse and inclusive employee base allows us \nto develop better ideas, respond to the needs \nof our clients and ensure that our people can \nreach their maximum potential. Pay equity is  \nfundamental to this, and we share the         \nproponent\u2019s focus on advancing pay equity.    \nWhile we recognize there is a desire among    \ncertain stakeholders for publication of more  \nstatistics regarding pay measures, we believe \nthe fundamental underlying consideration for  \nour firm and many corporations is the under-  \nrepresentation of women and diverse           \nprofessionals both in magnitude and levels of \nseniority. We are committed to compensating   \nour employees fairly and equitably and to     \npromoting gender and racial/ethnic diversity  \nand inclusion in our leadership ranks and     \nbroader workforce. To this end, we have       \npolicies and procedures in place with respect \nto our hiring, promotion and compensation     \npractices to support equitable treatment. This\nincludes ensuring compensation decisions are  \nsubject to multiple levels of review. We are  \nalso highly focused on providing transparency \nand accountability to our investors and other \nstakeholders. In addition to the regular      \nreporting we already provide on the firm\u2019s    \nprogress towards our aspirational diversity   \ngoals, as well as our annual EEO-1demographic \ndata, we have heard from many shareholders    \nthat additional disclosure regarding our pay  \npractices would be beneficial. Accordingly, we\nwill provide additional information regarding \nour gender and race pay gaps, as detailed     \nbelow, beginning next year (with respect to   \n2023 data). As a result of our existing       \npolicies and procedures, as well as this new  \ncommitment, we believe that the adoption of   \nthis proposal is unnecessary and not in the   \nbest interests of our firm or our             \nshareholders.                                 \n                                              \n       Our compensation policies and          \n       procedures are designed to compensate  \n       employees without regard to gender,    \n       race, ethnicity or other protected     \n       categories. Further, for nearly 20     \n       years the firm has been reviewing      \n       employee compensation during the       \n  \u220e    firm\u2019s annual compensation process.    \n       Our legal and human resource           \n       functions conduct an analysis of base  \n       salary and discretionary bonuses, the  \n       purpose of which is to help ensure     \n       the firm continues to pay employees    \n       comparable compensation for similar    \n       work.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       We believe that reporting median pay   \n       gaps on an unadjusted basis, as        \n       requested in the proposal, does not    \n       provide information that is accurate   \n       or useful, as it does not take into    \n  \u220e    account factors such as an employee\u2019s  \n       role, tenure, location or impact.      \n       These factors, among others, are       \n       necessary to consider when evaluating  \n       whether employees are comparably       \n       compensated for similar work.          \n                                              \n                                              \n       As part of our continued commitment    \n       to enhanced transparency and           \n       accountability, we commit to disclose  \n  \u220e    additional information regarding our   \n       gender and race pay gaps, with         \n       appropriate adjustments for factors    \n       such as those described above, in our  \n       2023 People Strategy Report.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       This disclosure is the next step on    \n       the firm\u2019s journey of enhanced         \n  \u220e    transparency and accountability        \n       regarding the diversity of our         \n       workforce.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n     Since 2021, we have published our        \n     People Strategy Report annually          \n     (available at www.gs.com), which         \n  \u00bb  provides tangible indicators of our      \n     progress on our people-related goals,    \n     including expanded EEO-1 disclosure and  \n     progress on our aspirational diversity   \n     goals.                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     While there is more work to be done, we  \n     are making notable progress towards      \n     achieving our aspirational diversity     \n  \u00bb  and inclusion goals.

In reviewing and determining    \nwhether to approve a related person           \ntransaction, the following factors, among     \nothers, are considered:                       \n                                              \n  \u220e    Whether the transaction is in the      \n       interests of us and our shareholders;  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction would impair   \n  \u220e    the independence of an independent     \n       director;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction presents a     \n       conflict of interest, taking into      \n       account the size of the transaction,   \n       the financial position of the          \n  \u220e    director or executive officer, the     \n       nature of the director\u2019s or executive  \n       officer\u2019s interest in the              \n       transaction, the ongoing nature of     \n       the transaction and any other          \n       relevant factors;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction is fair and    \n  \u220e    reasonable to us and on substantially  \n       the same terms as would apply to       \n       comparable third parties;              \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    The business reasons for the           \n       transaction;                           \n                                              \n                                     \n  \u220e    Any reputational issues; and  \n                                     \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction is material,   \n  \u220e    taking into account the significance   \n       of the transaction to our investors.   \n                                              \nAll of the transactions and relationships     \nreported under \u2014 Certain Relationships and    \nTransactionswere determined, under the        \nmechanisms of the Related Person Transactions \nPolicy, to be in the best interests of our    \nfirm and our shareholders. In addition to our \npolicies on director independence and related \nperson transactions, we also maintain a policy\nwith respect to outside director involvement  \nwith financial firms, such as private equity  \nfirms or hedge funds. Under this policy, in   \ndetermining whether to approve any current or \nproposed affiliation of a non-employeedirector\nwith a financial firm, our Board will         \nconsider, among other things, the legal,      \nreputational, operational and business issues \npresented, and the nature, feasibility and    \nscope of any restrictions, procedures or other\nsteps that would be necessary or appropriate  \nto ameliorate any perceived or potential      \nfuture conflicts or other issues.

We believe the           \nopportunity to make such investments helps to \npromote teamwork and collaboration across the \nfirm and provides alignment with the firm\u2019s   \nstrategy to grow the alternatives business.   \nInvestment decisions for the Employee Funds   \nare made by the investment teams or committees\nthat are fiduciaries for such funds, and no   \nexecutive officers are members of such        \ninvestment teams or committees. The Employee  \nFunds generally maintain diversified          \ninvestment portfolios, and these investment   \nopportunities do not affect the incentives of \nour executive officers under our compensation \nprogram. Many of our employees, their spouses,\nrelated charitable foundations or entities    \nthey own or control have invested in these    \nEmployee Funds. In some cases, we have limited\nparticipation to our PMDs, including our      \nexecutive officers, or limited the amount of  \nparticipation, and in some cases participation\nmay be limited to individuals eligible to     \ninvest pursuant to applicable law. Certain of \nthe Employee Funds provide applicable         \ninvestors with an interest in the overrides we\nreceive for managing the funds for independent\ninvestors (Overrides); the level of Override  \nfor which applicable investors may be eligible\nmay vary based on certain criteria. Employee  \nFunds generally do not require our current or \nretired PMDs and other current or retired     \nemployees to pay management fees and do not   \ndeduct Overrides from fund distributions.     \nSimilarly, certain other investments may be   \nmade available to our PMDs, retired PMDs and  \nother current employees on a fee-freeor       \nreduced fee basis. Distributions and          \nredemptions exceeding $120,000 from Employee  \nFunds made to our 2022 executive officers (or \npersons or entities affiliated with them)     \nduring 2022, consisting of profits and other  \nincome and return of amounts initially        \ninvested (excluding Overrides, which are      \ndiscussed below), were approximately, in the  \naggregate, as follows: Mr. Solomon - $15.5    \nmillion; Mr. Waldron - $1.8 million; Mr.      \nColeman - $1.6 million; Mr. Berlinski -       \n$580,000; John F.W.

Subject to applicable laws, in       \naddition, certain of our directors and        \nexecutive officers may from time to time      \ninvest their personal funds in other funds or \ninvestments that we have established and that \nwe manage or sponsor. Except as described     \nabove, these other investments are made on    \nsubstantially the same terms and conditions as\nother similarly-situated investors in these   \nfunds or investments who are neither directors\nnor employees. In certain of these funds,     \nincluding certain Employee Funds, our         \ndirectors and executive officers may own in   \nthe aggregate more than 10% of the interests  \nin these funds.

Under the facility, Goldman Sachs\nhas agreed to lend up to approximately $22.5  \nmillion at an interest rate of SOFR + 450     \nbasis points (which rate may vary based on a  \ncredit spread adjustment). This credit        \nfacility is currently partially drawn,        \nresulting in an approximately $19.4 million   \nloan from Goldman Sachs outstanding under this\nfacility. During 2022, Goldman Sachs acted as \nfinancial advisor to a third-party client that\nsold an approximately 80% interest in a $1    \nbillion asset to ArcelorMittal as a result of \na competitive bidding process. In December    \n2022 and early 2023, Goldman Sachs acted as   \nexecuting broker in connection with           \napproximately $560 million of public market   \ndivestments by ArcelorMittal of a portion of  \nits shareholding in an entity in which it is a\nminority shareholder. Each of these           \ntransactions was conducted and all of these   \nservices were provided on an                  \narm\u2019s-lengthbasis. Mr. Ogunlesi is the        \nChairman and Chief Executive Officer of Global\nInfrastructure Partners LLC (together with its\naffiliates, GIP). In connection with his role \nat GIP, Mr. Ogunlesi is entitled to less than \n5% of the total profit of the fund that       \nparticipated in the following transactions,   \nand he also has a direct or indirect interest \nin such fund amounting to less than 0.02% of  \nsuch fund. In March 2022, Goldman Sachs acted \nas an underwriter in an approximately $301    \nmillion public common stock offering for a    \ncompany in which a fund managed by GIP was a  \nselling stockholder. Such fund received       \napproximately $145 million of the proceeds of \nthe offering. In addition, in April 2022,     \nGoldman Sachs acted as an underwriter in an   \napproximately $400 million private debt       \noffering for a company in which a fund managed\nby GIP is an investor. Such fund received     \napproximately $200 million of the proceeds of \nthe offering, which were used to fund a       \nrepurchase of units in the company owned by   \nsuch fund. In each of these transactions,     \nGoldman Sachs\u2019 relationship with this company \npre-datesGIP\u2019s investment therein.

In the case    \n       of The 401(k) Savings Plan and the     \n       GreenSky Trade Credit LLC 401(k)       \n       Plan, a third-party investment         \n       manager who is not affiliated with GS  \n       is responsible for fund selection and  \n       selected the Vanguard mutual funds.    \n       We believe that the fees paid to The   \n       Vanguard Group through the Vanguard    \n       mutual funds are the same as the fees  \n       that are paid by the other holders of  \n       the same share classes of those        \n  (c)  funds.                                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n         GOLDMAN SACHS\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT\u00a0   \n  102    FOR\u00a0THE\u00a02023\u00a0ANNUAL\u00a0MEETING\u00a0OF\u00a0      \n         SHAREHOLDERS                         \n                                              \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION Additional Information \nHow to Contact Us Across our shareholder base \nthere is a wide variety of viewpoints about   \nmatters affecting our firm.

A \u201cbroker non-vote\u201doccurs when your \nbroker submits a proxy for the meeting with   \nrespect to the ratification of the appointment\nof our independent registered public          \naccounting firm but does not vote on non-     \ndiscretionarymatters because you did not      \nprovide voting instructions on these matters. \nIf I abstain, what happens to my vote? If you \nchoose to abstain from voting on the Election \nof Directors, your abstention will have no    \neffect, as the required vote is calculated    \nthrough the following calculation: votes FOR  \ndivided by the sum of votes FOR plus votes    \nAGAINST. If you chose to abstain from voting  \non the advisory vote on the frequency of Say  \non Pay vote, your abstention will have the    \neffect of voting AGAINST each frequency. If   \nyou choose to abstain from voting on any other\nmatter at our Annual Meeting, your abstention \nwill be counted as a vote AGAINST the         \nproposal, as the required vote is calculated  \nthrough the following calculation: votes FOR  \ndivided by the sum of votes FOR plus votes    \nAGAINST plus votes ABSTAINING. When will      \nGoldman Sachs next hold an advisory vote on   \nthe frequency of Say on Pay votes? An advisory\nvote on the frequency of Say on Pay votes is  \nItem 3 of this Proxy Statement. After this    \nmeeting, the next advisory vote on the        \nfrequency of Say on Pay votes will be held no \nlater than our 2029 Annual Meeting of         \nShareholders.

ROTE is calculated by   \ndividing net earnings applicable to common    \nshareholders by average monthly tangible      \ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity (tangible common  \nshareholders\u2019 equity is calculated as total   \nshareholders\u2019 equity less preferred stock,    \ngoodwill and identifiable intangible assets). \nManagement believes that ROTE is meaningful   \nbecause it measures the performance of        \nbusinesses consistently, whether they were    \nacquired or developed internally, and that    \ntangible common shareholders\u2019 equity is       \nmeaningful because it is a measure that the   \nfirm and investors use to assess capital      \nadequacy. ROTE and tangible common            \nshareholders\u2019 equity are non-GAAP measures and\nmay not be comparable to similar non-GAAP     \nmeasures used by other companies.
