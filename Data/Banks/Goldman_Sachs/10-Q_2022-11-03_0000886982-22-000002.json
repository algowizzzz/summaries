The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a\nvoting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)\nthe total equity investment at risk is\nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity\nholders have the power to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the\nentity and the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting\ninterest entity is ownership of a majority\nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest\nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable\nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that\nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a\nvoting interest entity. The firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when\nthe firm has a variable interest or interests\nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive\nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for\nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method\nInvestments. When the firm does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity\nbut can exert significant influence over the\nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair\nvalue by electing the fair value option\navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant\ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns\n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstance common stock. In certain cases, the\nfirm applies the equity method of accounting\nto new investments that are strategic in\nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s\nprincipal business activities, when the firm\nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or\nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less\nsignificant. See Note 8 for further\ninformation about equity-method investments.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form        6  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed\ninvestment funds with third-party investors.\nThese funds are typically organized as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies\nfor which the firm acts as general partner or\nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a\nmajority of the economic interests in these\nfunds. These funds are usually voting interest\nentities and generally are not consolidated\nbecause third-party investors typically have\nrights to terminate the funds or to remove the\nfirm as general partner or manager.\nInvestments in these funds are generally\nmeasured at net asset value (NAV) and are\nincluded in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and\n22 for further information about investments\nin funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of\nthese consolidated financial statements\nrequires management to make certain estimates\nand assumptions, the most important of which\nrelate to fair value measurements, the\nallowance for credit losses on loans and\nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,\naccounting for goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, provisions for losses that\nmay arise from litigation and regulatory\nproceedings (including governmental\ninvestigations), and accounting for income\ntaxes. These estimates and assumptions are\nbased on the best available information, but\nactual results could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition Financial Assets and\nLiabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and\nliabilities and certain investments are\ncarried at fair value either under the fair\nvalue option or in accordance with other U.S.\nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to\naccount for certain of its loans and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nby electing the fair value option. The fair\nvalue of a financial instrument is the amount\nthat would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked\nto bid prices and financial liabilities are\nmarked to offer prices. Fair value\nmeasurements do not include transaction costs.\nFair value gains or losses are generally\nincluded in market making or other principal\ntransactions. See Note 4 for further\ninformation about fair value measurements.\nRevenue from Contracts with Clients. The firm\nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with\nclients for services, such as investment\nbanking, investment management, and execution\nand clearing (contracts with clients), when\nthe performance obligations related to the\nunderlying transaction are completed. Revenues\nfrom contracts with clients represent\napproximately 45% of total non-interest\nrevenues for the three months ended September\n2022 (including approximately 90% of\ninvestment banking revenues, approximately 95%\nof investment management revenues and all\ncommissions and fees) and approximately 45% of\ntotal non-interest revenues for the nine\nmonths ended September 2022 (including\napproximately 85% of investment banking\nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment\nmanagement revenues and all commissions and\nfees), and approximately 50% of total non-\ninterest revenues for the three months ended\nSeptember 2021 and approximately 40% for the\nnine months ended September 2021 (in each\ncase, reflecting approximately 90% of\ninvestment banking revenues, approximately 95%\nof investment management revenues and all\ncommissions and fees). See Note 25 for\ninformation about net revenues by business\nsegment. Investment Banking Advisory. Fees\nfrom financial advisory assignments are\nrecognized in revenues when the services\nrelated to the underlying transaction are\ncompleted under the terms of the assignment.\nNon-refundable deposits and milestone payments\nin connection with financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon\ncompletion of the underlying transaction or\nwhen the assignment is otherwise concluded.\nExpenses associated with financial advisory\nassignments are recognized when incurred and\nare included in transaction based expenses.\nClient reimbursements for such expenses are\nincluded in investment banking revenues.\nUnderwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon\ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses\nassociated with underwriting assignments are\ngenerally deferred until the related revenue\nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise\nconcluded. Such expenses are included in\ntransaction based expenses for completed\nassignments.\n                                              \n  7    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form      \n       10-Q                                   \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nInvestment Management The firm earns\nmanagement fees and incentive fees for\ninvestment management services, which are\nincluded in investment management revenues.\nThe firm makes payments to brokers and\nadvisors related to the placement of the\nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),\nwhich are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily net asset value and are received\nmonthly. Management fees for hedge funds and\nseparately managed accounts are calculated as\na percentage of month-end net asset value and\nare generally received quarterly. Management\nfees for private equity funds are calculated\nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are received quarterly,\nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the\nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.\nDistribution fees paid by the firm are\ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net\nasset value or the committed capital. Such\nfees are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are\ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or\nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other\nperformance target. Incentive fees are\ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a\nfund. Fees that are based on performance over\na twelve-month period are subject to\nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment\nperformance over the life of the fund, future\ninvestment underperformance may require fees\npreviously distributed to the firm to be\nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned\nfrom a fund or separately managed account are\nrecognized when it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal of such fees will not\noccur, which is generally when such fees are\nno longer subject to fluctuations in the\nmarket value of investments held by the fund\nor separately managed account. Therefore,\nincentive fees recognized during the period\nmay relate to performance obligations\nsatisfied in previous periods. Commissions and\nFees The firm earns commissions and fees from\nexecuting and clearing client transactions on\nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter (OTC) transactions.\nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides\nthird-party research services to clients in\nconnection with certain soft-dollar\narrangements. Third-party research costs\nincurred by the firm in connection with such\narrangements are presented net within\ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance\nObligations Remaining performance obligations\nare services that the firm has committed to\nperform in the future in connection with its\ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining\nperformance obligations are generally related\nto its financial advisory assignments and\ncertain investment management activities.\nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory\nassignments cannot be determined until the\noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s\ninvestment management activities, where fees\nare calculated based on the net asset value of\nthe fund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining\nperformance obligations cannot be determined\nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in\nthe market value of investments held by the\nfund or separately managed account. The firm\nis able to determine the future revenues\nassociated with management fees calculated\nbased on committed capital. As of September\n2022, substantially all future net revenues\nassociated with such remaining performance\nobligations will be recognized through 2029.\nAnnual revenues associated with such\nperformance obligations average less than $\n300million through 2029. Transfers of\nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has\nrelinquished control over the assets\ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses\nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or\nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement with transferred\nfinancial assets are initially recognized at\nfair value. For transfers of financial assets\nthat are not accounted for as sales, the\nassets are generally included in trading\nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a\ncollateralized financing, with the related\ninterest expense recognized over the life of\nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about transfers of financial\nassets accounted for as collateralized\nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted\nfor as sales.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form        8  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Such receivables primarily\nconsist of customer margin loans, receivables\nresulting from unsettled transactions and\ncollateral posted in connection with certain\nderivative transactions. Substantially all of\nthese receivables are accounted for at\namortized cost net of any allowance for credit\nlosses, which generally approximates fair\nvalue. As these receivables are not accounted\nfor at fair value, they are not included in\nthe firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4\nthrough 10. Had these receivables been\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,\nsubstantially all would have been classified\nin level 2 as of both September 2022 and\nDecember 2021. See Note 10 for further\ninformation about customer and other\nreceivables accounted for at fair value under\nthe fair value option. Interest on customer\nand other receivables is recognized over the\nlife of the transaction and included in\ninterest income. Customer and other\nreceivables includes receivables from\ncontracts with clients and contract assets.\nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to\nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s\nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n2.80billion as of September 2022 and $\n3.01billion as of December 2021. As of both\nSeptember 2022 and December 2021 contract\nassets were not material. Customer and Other\nPayables Customer and other payables included\npayables to customers and counterparties of $\n254.58billion as of September 2022 and $\n241.93billion as of December 2021, and\npayables to brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations of $ 23.88billion as of\nSeptember 2022 and $ 10.00billion as of\nDecember 2021. Such payables primarily consist\nof customer credit balances related to the\nfirm\u2019s prime brokerage activities. Customer\nand other payables are accounted for at cost\nplus accrued interest, which generally\napproximates fair value. As these payables are\nnot accounted for at fair value, they are not\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 through 10. Had these payables been\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,\nsubstantially all would have been classified\nin level 2 as of both September 2022 and\nDecember 2021. Interest on customer and other\npayables is recognized over the life of the\ntransaction and included in interest expense.\nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities To reduce\ncredit exposures on derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter\ninto master netting agreements or similar\narrangements (collectively, netting\nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such\ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a\ncontract with a counterparty that permits net\nsettlement of multiple transactions with that\ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of\ntermination rights by a non-defaulting party.\nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all\ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is\ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with\nrespect to its derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms\nof the related credit support agreements or\nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit\nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit\nsupport agreement grants the non-defaulting\nparty exercising termination rights the right\nto liquidate the collateral and apply the\nproceeds to any amounts owed. In order to\nassess enforceability of the firm\u2019s right of\nsetoff under netting and credit support\nagreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in\nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the\nagreement. Derivatives are reported on a net-\nby-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for derivative assets and\nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the\nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting\nagreement. Resale agreements and securities\nsold under agreements to repurchase\n(repurchase agreements) and securities\nborrowed and loaned transactions with the same\nterm and currency are presented on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis in the consolidated balance\nsheets when such transactions meet certain\nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements.\n                                              \n  9    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form      \n       10-Q                                   \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Share-\nBased Compensation The\ncost of employee\nservices received in\nexchange for a share-\nbased award is\ngenerally measured\nbased on the grant-\ndate fair value of the\naward. Share-based\nawards that do not\nrequire future service\n(i.e., vested awards,\nincluding awards\ngranted to retirement-\neligible employees)\nare expensed\nimmediately. Share-\nbased awards that\nrequire future service\nare amortized over the\nrelevant service\nperiod. Forfeitures\nare recorded when they\noccur. Cash dividend\nequivalents paid on\nrestricted stock units\n(RSUs) are generally\ncharged to retained\nearnings. If RSUs that\nrequire future service\nare forfeited, the\nrelated dividend\nequivalents originally\ncharged to retained\nearnings are\nreclassified to\ncompensation expense\nin the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The\nfirm generally issues\nnew shares of common\nstock upon delivery of\nshare-based awards. In\ncertain cases,\nprimarily related to\nconflicted employment\n(as outlined in the\napplicable award\nagreements), the firm\nmay cash settle share-\nbased compensation\nawards accounted for\nas equity instruments.\nFor these awards,\nwhose terms allow for\ncash settlement,\nadditional paid-in\ncapital is adjusted to\nthe extent of the\ndifference between the\nvalue of the award at\nthe time of cash\nsettlement and the\ngrant-date value of\nthe award. The tax\neffect related to the\nsettlement of share-\nbased awards is\nrecorded in income tax\nbenefit or expense.\nForeign Currency\nTranslation Assets and\nliabilities\ndenominated in\nnon-U.S. currencies\nare translated at\nrates of exchange\nprevailing on the date\nof the consolidated\nbalance sheets and\nrevenues and expenses\nare translated at\naverage rates of\nexchange for the\nperiod.

Fair\nvalue measurements do\nnot include\ntransaction costs. The\nfirm measures certain\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based\non its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit\nrisks). The best\nevidence of fair value\nis a quoted price in\nan active market. If\nquoted prices in\nactive markets are not\navailable, fair value\nis determined by\nreference to prices\nfor similar\ninstruments, quoted\nprices or recent\ntransactions in less\nactive markets, or\ninternally developed\nmodels that primarily\nuse market-based or\nindependently sourced\ninputs, including, but\nnot limited to,\ninterest rates,\nvolatilities, equity\nor debt prices,\nforeign exchange\nrates, commodity\nprices, credit spreads\nand funding spreads\n(i.e., the spread or\ndifference between the\ninterest rate at which\na borrower could\nfinance a given\nfinancial instrument\nrelative to a\nbenchmark interest\nrate). U.S. GAAP has a\nthree-level hierarchy\nfor disclosure of fair\nvalue measurements.\nThis hierarchy\nprioritizes inputs to\nthe valuation\ntechniques used to\nmeasure fair value,\ngiving the highest\npriority to level 1\ninputs and the lowest\npriority to level 3\ninputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in\nthis hierarchy is\nbased on the lowest\nlevel of input that is\nsignificant to its\nfair value\nmeasurement. In\nevaluating the\nsignificance of a\nvaluation input, the\nfirm considers, among\nother factors, a\nportfolio\u2019s net risk\nexposure to that\ninput. The fair value\nhierarchy is as\nfollows: Level 1.\nInputs are unadjusted\nquoted prices in\nactive markets to\nwhich the firm had\naccess at the\nmeasurement date for\nidentical,\nunrestricted assets or\nliabilities. Level 2.\nInputs to valuation\ntechniques are\nobservable, either\ndirectly or\nindirectly. Level 3.\nOne or more inputs to\nvaluation techniques\nare significant and\nunobservable. The fair\nvalues for\nsubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s financial\nassets and liabilities\nare based on\nobservable prices and\ninputs and are\nclassified in levels 1\nand 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nCertain level 2 and\nlevel 3 financial\nassets and liabilities\nmay require valuation\nadjustments that a\nmarket participant\nwould require to\narrive at fair value\nfor factors, such as\ncounterparty and the\nfirm\u2019s credit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer\nrestrictions,\nliquidity and\nbid/offer spreads.\nValuation adjustments\nare generally based on\nmarket evidence.\n\nThe valuation\ntechniques and nature\nof significant inputs\nused to determine the\nfair value of the\nfirm\u2019s financial\ninstruments are\ndescribed below. See\nNotes 5 through 10 for\nfurther information\nabout significant\nunobservable inputs\nused to value level 3\nfinancial instruments.\nValuation Techniques\nand Significant Inputs\nfor Trading Cash\nInstruments,\nInvestments and Loans\nLevel 1. Level 1\ninstruments include\nU.S. government\nobligations, most\nnon-U.S. government\nobligations, certain\nagency obligations,\ncertain corporate debt\ninstruments, certain\nmoney market\ninstruments, certain\nother debt obligations\nand actively traded\nlisted equities. These\ninstruments are valued\nusing quoted prices\nfor identical\nunrestricted\ninstruments in active\nmarkets. The firm\ndefines active markets\nfor equity instruments\nbased on the average\ndaily trading volume\nboth in absolute terms\nand relative to the\nmarket capitalization\nfor the instrument.\nThe firm defines\nactive markets for\ndebt instruments based\non both the average\ndaily trading volume\nand the number of days\nwith trading activity.\nLevel 2. Level 2\ninstruments include\ncertain non-U.S.\ngovernment\nobligations, most\nagency obligations,\nmost mortgage-backed\nloans and securities,\nmost corporate debt\ninstruments, most\nstate and municipal\nobligations, most\nmoney market\ninstruments, most\nother debt\nobligations,\nrestricted or less\nliquid listed\nequities, certain\nprivate equities,\ncommodities and\ncertain lending\ncommitments.\nValuations of level 2\ninstruments can be\nverified to quoted\nprices, recent trading\nactivity for identical\nor similar\ninstruments, broker or\ndealer quotations or\nalternative pricing\nsources with\nreasonable levels of\nprice transparency.\nConsideration is given\nto the nature of the\nquotations (e.g.,\nindicative or\nexecutable) and the\nrelationship of recent\nmarket activity to the\nprices provided from\nalternative pricing\nsources. Valuation\nadjustments are\ntypically made to\nlevel 2 instruments\n(i) if the instrument\nis subject to transfer\nrestrictions and/or\n(ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity\ndiscounts that a\nmarket participant\nwould require to\narrive at fair value.\nValuation adjustments\nare generally based on\nmarket evidence. Level\n3. Level 3 instruments\nhave one or more\nsignificant valuation\ninputs that are not\nobservable. Absent\nevidence to the\ncontrary, level 3\ninstruments are\ninitially valued at\ntransaction price,\nwhich is considered to\nbe the best initial\nestimate of fair\nvalue. Subsequently,\nthe firm uses other\nmethodologies to\ndetermine fair value,\nwhich vary based on\nthe type of\ninstrument.

The valuation\ntechniques and the nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair values of\neach type of level 3 instrument are described\nbelow: Loans and Securities Backed by\nCommercial Real Estate Loans and securities\nbacked by commercial real estate are directly\nor indirectly collateralized by a single\nproperty or a portfolio of properties, and may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. Significant inputs are\ngenerally determined based on relative value\nanalyses and include: \u2022 Market yields implied\nby transactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and changes in market\nindices, such as the CMBX (an index that\ntracks the performance of commercial mortgage\nbonds); \u2022 Transaction prices in both the\nunderlying collateral and instruments with the\nsame or similar underlying collateral; \u2022 A\nmeasure of expected future cash flows in a\ndefault scenario (recovery rates) implied by\nthe value of the underlying collateral, which\nis mainly driven by current performance of the\nunderlying collateral and capitalization\nrates. Recovery rates are expressed as a\npercentage of notional or face value of the\ninstrument and reflect the benefit of credit\nenhancements on certain instruments; and \u2022\nTiming of expected future cash flows\n(duration) which, in certain cases, may\nincorporate the impact of any loan\nforbearances and other unobservable inputs\n(e.g., prepayment speeds). Loans and\nSecurities Backed by Residential Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by residential\nreal estate are directly or indirectly\ncollateralized by portfolios of residential\nreal estate and may include tranches of\nvarying levels of subordination. Significant\ninputs are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons to instruments with similar\ncollateral and risk profiles. Significant\ninputs include: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets; \u2022\nTransaction prices in both the underlying\ncollateral and instruments with the same or\nsimilar underlying collateral; \u2022 Cumulative\nloss expectations, driven by default rates,\nhome price projections, residential property\nliquidation timelines, related costs and\nsubsequent recoveries; and \u2022 Duration, driven\nby underlying loan prepayment speeds and\nresidential property liquidation timelines.\nCorporate Debt Instruments Corporate debt\ninstruments includes corporate loans, debt\nsecurities and convertible debentures.\nSignificant inputs for corporate debt\ninstruments are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons both to prices of credit default\nswaps that reference the same or similar\nunderlying instrument or entity and to other\ndebt instruments for the same or similar\nissuer for which observable prices or broker\nquotations are available. Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks\nthe performance of corporate credit); \u2022\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions\nand, where the firm uses credit default swaps\nto value the related instrument, the cost of\nborrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n\u2022 Duration; and \u2022 Market and transaction\nmultiples for corporate debt instruments with\nconvertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities Equity securities consists\nof private equities. Recent third-party\ncompleted or pending transactions (e.g.,\nmerger proposals, debt restructurings, tender\noffers) are considered the best evidence for\nany change in fair value. When these are not\navailable, the following valuation\nmethodologies are used, as appropriate: \u2022\nIndustry multiples (primarily EBITDA and\nrevenue multiples) and public comparables; \u2022\nTransactions in similar instruments; \u2022\nDiscounted cash flow techniques; and \u2022 Third-\nparty appraisals. The firm also considers\nchanges in the outlook for the relevant\nindustry and financial performance of the\nissuer as compared to projected performance.\nSignificant inputs include: \u2022 Market and\ntransaction multiples; \u2022 Discount rates and\ncapitalization rates; and \u2022 For equity\nsecurities with debt-like features, market\nyields implied by transactions of similar or\nrelated assets, current performance and\nrecovery assumptions, and duration.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form       12  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Significant\ninputs include: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices; \u2022 Current performance and recovery\nassumptions and, where the firm uses credit\ndefault swaps to value the related instrument,\nthe cost of borrowing the underlying reference\nobligation; and \u2022 Duration. Valuation\nTechniques and Significant Inputs for\nDerivatives The firm\u2019s level 2 and level 3\nderivatives are valued using derivative\npricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow\nmodels, correlation models and models that\nincorporate option pricing methodologies, such\nas Monte Carlo simulations). Price\ntransparency of derivatives can generally be\ncharacterized by product type, as described\nbelow. \u2022 Interest Rate. In general, the key\ninputs used to value interest rate derivatives\nare transparent, even for most long-dated\ncontracts. Interest rate swaps and options\ndenominated in the currencies of leading\nindustrialized nations are characterized by\nhigh trading volumes and tight bid/offer\nspreads. Interest rate derivatives that\nreference indices, such as an inflation index,\nor the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year\nswap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) are more\ncomplex, but the key inputs are generally\nobservable. \u2022 Credit. Price transparency for\ncredit default swaps, including both single\nnames and baskets of credits, varies by market\nand underlying reference entity or obligation.\nCredit default swaps that reference indices,\nlarge corporates and major sovereigns\ngenerally exhibit the most price transparency.\nFor credit default swaps with other\nunderliers, price transparency varies based on\ncredit rating, the cost of borrowing the\nunderlying reference obligations, and the\navailability of the underlying reference\nobligations for delivery upon the default of\nthe issuer. Credit default swaps that\nreference loans, asset-backed securities and\nemerging market debt instruments tend to have\nless price transparency than those that\nreference corporate bonds. In addition, more\ncomplex credit derivatives, such as those\nsensitive to the correlation between two or\nmore underlying reference obligations,\ngenerally have less price transparency. \u2022\nCurrency. Prices for currency derivatives\nbased on the exchange rates of leading\nindustrialized nations, including those with\nlonger tenors, are generally transparent. The\nprimary difference between the price\ntransparency of developed and emerging market\ncurrency derivatives is that emerging markets\ntend to be only observable for contracts with\nshorter tenors. \u2022 Commodity. Commodity\nderivatives include transactions referenced to\nenergy (e.g., oil, natural gas and\nelectricity), metals (e.g., precious and base)\nand soft commodities (e.g., agricultural).\nPrice transparency varies based on the\nunderlying commodity, delivery location, tenor\nand product quality (e.g., diesel fuel\ncompared to unleaded gasoline). In general,\nprice transparency for commodity derivatives\nis greater for contracts with shorter tenors\nand contracts that are more closely aligned\nwith major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n\u2022 Equity. Price transparency for equity\nderivatives varies by market and underlier.\nOptions on indices and the common stock of\ncorporates included in major equity indices\nexhibit the most price transparency. Equity\nderivatives generally have observable market\nprices, except for contracts with long tenors\nor reference prices that differ significantly\nfrom current market prices. More complex\nequity derivatives, such as those sensitive to\nthe correlation between two or more individual\nstocks, generally have less price\ntransparency. Liquidity is essential to the\nobservability of all product types. If\ntransaction volumes decline, previously\ntransparent prices and other inputs may become\nunobservable. Conversely, even highly\nstructured products may at times have trading\nvolumes large enough to provide observability\nof prices and other inputs. Level 1. Level 1\nderivatives include short-term contracts for\nfuture delivery of securities when the\nunderlying security is a level 1 instrument,\nand exchange-traded derivatives if they are\nactively traded and are valued at their quoted\nmarket price. Level 2. Level 2 derivatives\ninclude OTC derivatives for which all\nsignificant valuation inputs are corroborated\nby market evidence and exchange-traded\nderivatives that are not actively traded\nand/or that are valued using models that\ncalibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC\nderivatives. The selection of a particular\nmodel to value a derivative depends on the\ncontractual terms of and specific risks\ninherent in the instrument, as well as the\navailability of pricing information in the\nmarket. For derivatives that trade in liquid\nmarkets, model selection does not involve\nsignificant management judgment because\noutputs of models can be calibrated to market-\nclearing levels.\n                                              \n  13    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nValuation models require a variety of inputs,\nsuch as contractual terms, market prices,\nyield curves, discount rates (including those\nderived from interest rates on collateral\nreceived and posted as specified in credit\nsupport agreements for collateralized\nderivatives), credit curves, measures of\nvolatility, prepayment rates, loss severity\nrates and correlations of such inputs.\nSignificant inputs to the valuations of level\n2 derivatives can be verified to market\ntransactions, broker or dealer quotations or\nother alternative pricing sources with\nreasonable levels of price transparency.\nConsideration is given to the nature of the\nquotations (e.g., indicative or executable)\nand the relationship of recent market activity\nto the prices provided from alternative\npricing sources. Level 3 . Level 3 derivatives\nare valued using models which utilize\nobservable level 1 and/or level 2 inputs, as\nwell as unobservable level 3 inputs. The\nsignificant unobservable inputs used to value\nthe firm\u2019s level 3 derivatives are described\nbelow. \u2022 For level 3 interest rate and\ncurrency derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs include correlations of certain\ncurrencies and interest rates (e.g., the\ncorrelation between Euro inflation and Euro\ninterest rates) and specific interest rate and\ncurrency volatilities. \u2022 For level 3 credit\nderivatives, significant unobservable inputs\ninclude illiquid credit spreads and upfront\ncredit points, which are unique to specific\nreference obligations and reference entities,\nand recovery rates. \u2022 For level 3 commodity\nderivatives, significant unobservable inputs\ninclude volatilities for options with strike\nprices that differ significantly from current\nmarket prices and prices or spreads for\ncertain products for which the product quality\nor physical location of the commodity is not\naligned with benchmark indices. \u2022 For level 3\nequity derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs generally include equity volatility\ninputs for options that are long-dated and/or\nhave strike prices that differ significantly\nfrom current market prices. In addition, the\nvaluation of certain structured trades\nrequires the use of level 3 correlation\ninputs, such as the correlation of the price\nperformance of two or more individual stocks\nor the correlation of the price performance\nfor a basket of stocks to another asset class,\nsuch as commodities. Subsequent to the initial\nvaluation of a level 3 derivative, the firm\nupdates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to\nreflect observable market changes and any\nresulting gains and losses are classified in\nlevel 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when\ncorroborated by evidence, such as similar\nmarket transactions, third-party pricing\nservices and/or broker or dealer quotations or\nother empirical market data. In circumstances\nwhere the firm cannot verify the model value\nby reference to market transactions, it is\npossible that a different valuation model\ncould produce a materially different estimate\nof fair value. See Note 7 for further\ninformation about significant unobservable\ninputs used in the valuation of level 3\nderivatives. Valuation Adjustments. Valuation\nadjustments are integral to determining the\nfair value of derivative portfolios and are\nused to adjust the mid-market valuations\nproduced by derivative pricing models to the\nexit price valuation. These adjustments\nincorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of\nliquidity, and credit and funding valuation\nadjustments, which account for the credit and\nfunding risk inherent in the uncollateralized\nportion of derivative portfolios. The firm\nalso makes funding valuation adjustments to\ncollateralized derivatives where the terms of\nthe agreement do not permit the firm to\ndeliver or repledge collateral received.\nMarket-based inputs are generally used when\ncalibrating valuation adjustments to market-\nclearing levels. In addition, for derivatives\nthat include significant unobservable inputs,\nthe firm makes model or exit price adjustments\nto account for the valuation uncertainty\npresent in the transaction.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form       14  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Due to\nthe distinctive nature\nof each level 3\ntrading cash\ninstrument, the\ninterrelationship of\ninputs is not\nnecessarily uniform\nwithin each product\ntype. \u2022 Trading cash\ninstruments are valued\nusing discounted cash\nflows. \u2022 In other, the\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nfor multiples as of\nDecember 2021 did not\nhave a range (and\nthere was no weighted\naverage) as they\npertained to a single\nposition.

An average\ngreater than the median indicates that the\nmajority of inputs are below the average.

For example,\nthe highest correlation for interest rate\nderivatives is appropriate for valuing a\nspecific interest rate derivative but may not\nbe appropriate for valuing any other interest\nrate derivative. Accordingly, the ranges of\ninputs do not represent uncertainty in, or\npossible ranges of, fair value measurements of\nlevel 3 derivatives. \u2022 Interest rates,\ncurrencies and equities derivatives are valued\nusing option pricing models, credit\nderivatives are valued using option pricing,\ncorrelation and discounted cash flow models,\nand commodities derivatives are valued using\noption pricing and discounted cash flow\nmodels. \u2022 The fair value of any one instrument\nmay be determined using multiple valuation\ntechniques. For example, option pricing models\nand discounted cash flow models are typically\nused together to determine fair value.\nTherefore, the level 3 balance encompasses\nboth of these techniques. \u2022 Correlation within\ncurrencies and equities includes cross-product\ntype correlation. \u2022 Natural gas spread\nrepresents the spread per million British\nthermal units of natural gas. \u2022 Oil spread\nrepresents the spread per barrel of oil and\nrefined products. \u2022 Electricity price\nrepresents the price per megawatt hour of\nelectricity. Range of Significant Unobservable\nInputs The following provides information\nabout the ranges of significant unobservable\ninputs used to value the firm\u2019s level 3\nderivative instruments: \u2022 Correlation. Ranges\nfor correlation cover a variety of underliers\nboth within one product type (e.g., equity\nindex and equity single stock names) and\nacross product types (e.g., correlation of an\ninterest rate and a currency), as well as\nacross regions. Generally, cross-product type\ncorrelation inputs are used to value more\ncomplex instruments and are lower than\ncorrelation inputs on assets within the same\nderivative product type. \u2022 Volatility. Ranges\nfor volatility cover numerous underliers\nacross a variety of markets, maturities and\nstrike prices. For example, volatility of\nequity indices is generally lower than\nvolatility of single stocks. \u2022 Credit spreads,\nupfront credit points and recovery rates. The\nranges for credit spreads, upfront credit\npoints and recovery rates cover a variety of\nunderliers (index and single names), regions,\nsectors, maturities and credit qualities\n(high-yield and investment-grade). The broad\nrange of this population gives rise to the\nwidth of the ranges of significant\nunobservable inputs. \u2022 Commodity prices and\nspreads. The ranges for commodity prices and\nspreads cover variability in products,\nmaturities and delivery locations. Sensitivity\nof Fair Value Measurement to Changes in\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs The following\nis a description of the directional\nsensitivity of the firm\u2019s level 3 fair value\nmeasurements to changes in significant\nunobservable inputs, in isolation, as of each\nperiod-end: \u2022 Correlation. In general, for\ncontracts where the holder benefits from the\nconvergence of the underlying asset or index\nprices (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, inflation rates and\nequity prices), an increase in correlation\nresults in a higher fair value measurement. \u2022\nVolatility. In general, for purchased options,\nan increase in volatility results in a higher\nfair value measurement. \u2022 Credit spreads,\nupfront credit points and recovery rates. In\ngeneral, the fair value of purchased credit\nprotection increases as credit spreads or\nupfront credit points increase or recovery\nrates decrease. Credit spreads, upfront credit\npoints and recovery rates are strongly related\nto distinctive risk factors of the underlying\nreference obligations, which include reference\nentity-specific factors, such as leverage,\nvolatility and industry, market-based risk\nfactors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity\nof the underlying reference obligation, and\nmacroeconomic conditions. \u2022 Commodity prices\nand spreads. In general, for contracts where\nthe holder is receiving a commodity, an\nincrease in the spread (price difference from\na benchmark index due to differences in\nquality or delivery location) or price results\nin a higher fair value measurement. Due to the\ndistinctive nature of each of the firm\u2019s level\n3 derivatives, the interrelationship of inputs\nis not necessarily uniform within each product\ntype.\n                                              \n  23    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Credit\nderivatives are\ngenerally individually\nnegotiated contracts\nand can have various\nsettlement and payment\nconventions. Credit\nevents include failure\nto pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of\nindebtedness,\nrestructuring,\nrepudiation and\ndissolution of the\nreference entity. The\nfirm enters into the\nfollowing types of\ncredit derivatives: \u2022\nCredit Default Swaps.\nSingle-name credit\ndefault swaps protect\nthe buyer against the\nloss of principal on\none or more bonds,\nloans or mortgages\n(reference\nobligations) in the\nevent the issuer of\nthe reference\nobligations suffers a\ncredit event. The\nbuyer of protection\npays an initial or\nperiodic premium to\nthe seller and\nreceives protection\nfor the period of the\ncontract. If there is\nno credit event, as\ndefined in the\ncontract, the seller\nof protection makes no\npayments to the buyer.\nIf a credit event\noccurs, the seller of\nprotection is required\nto make a payment to\nthe buyer, calculated\naccording to the terms\nof the contract. \u2022\nCredit Options. In a\ncredit option, the\noption writer assumes\nthe obligation to\npurchase or sell a\nreference obligation\nat a specified price\nor credit spread. The\noption purchaser buys\nthe right, but does\nnot assume the\nobligation, to sell\nthe reference\nobligation to, or\npurchase it from, the\noption writer. The\npayments on credit\noptions depend either\non a particular credit\nspread or the price of\nthe reference\nobligation.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form       26  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

If\na credit event occurs\nin one of the\nunderlying reference\nobligations, the\nprotection seller pays\nthe protection buyer.\nThe payment is\ntypically a pro-rata\nportion of the\ntransaction\u2019s total\nnotional amount based\non the underlying\ndefaulted reference\nobligation. In certain\ntransactions, the\ncredit risk of a\nbasket or index is\nseparated into various\nportions (tranches),\neach having different\nlevels of\nsubordination. The\nmost junior tranches\ncover initial defaults\nand once losses exceed\nthe notional amount of\nthese junior tranches,\nany excess loss is\ncovered by the next\nmost senior tranche. \u2022\nTotal Return Swaps. A\ntotal return swap\ntransfers the risks\nrelating to economic\nperformance of a\nreference obligation\nfrom the protection\nbuyer to the\nprotection seller.\nTypically, the\nprotection buyer\nreceives a floating\nrate of interest and\nprotection against any\nreduction in fair\nvalue of the reference\nobligation, and the\nprotection seller\nreceives the cash\nflows associated with\nthe reference\nobligation, plus any\nincrease in the fair\nvalue of the reference\nobligation. The firm\neconomically hedges\nits exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a\nparticular written\ncredit derivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default. As\nof September 2022,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n557.61billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n619.11billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 61.50billion. As\nof December 2021,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n510.24billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n569.34billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 59.10billion.

However,\nbased on recent\ninterpretations of the\ncovered fund\nprovisions of the\nVolcker Rule, the firm\nmay be required to\nseek an additional\nextension from the\nBoard of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB) to bring\nthese funds into\nconformance. If the\nfirm does not receive\nany required\nextensions or conform\nby the end of any\nextensions received,\nthe firm may be\nrequired to sell such\ninterests. If that\noccurs, the firm may\nreceive a value for\nits interests that is\nless than the then\ncarrying value as\nthere could be a\nlimited secondary\nmarket for these\ninvestments and the\nfirm may be unable to\nsell them in orderly\ntransactions.\nThe table below presents the fair value of\ninvestments in funds at NAV and the related\nunfunded commitments.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  millions                                    \n  As of                Fair                   \n  September        Value of         Unfunded  \n  2022            Investme\u2026       Commitmen\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Private                                     \n  equity       $        955    $         589  \n  funds                                       \n  Credit              1,649              417  \n  funds                                       \n  Hedge                  70                \u2014  \n  funds                                       \n  Real                                        \n  estate                297              129  \n  funds                                       \n  Total        $      2,971    $       1,135  \n  As of                                       \n  December                                    \n  2021                                        \n  Private                                     \n  equity       $      1,411    $         619  \n  funds                                       \n  Credit              1,686              556  \n  funds                                       \n  Hedge                  84                \u2014  \n  funds                                       \n  Real                                        \n  estate                288              147  \n  funds                                       \n  Total        $      3,469    $       1,322  \n                                              \nAvailable-for-Sale\nSecurities Available-\nfor-sale securities\nare accounted for at\nfair value, and the\nrelated unrealized\nfair value gains and\nlosses are included in\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss) unless\ndesignated in a fair\nvalue hedging\nrelationship.

For example,\nthe highest multiple for private equity\nsecurities is appropriate for valuing a\nspecific private equity security but may not\nbe appropriate for valuing any other private\nequity security. Accordingly, the ranges of\ninputs do not represent uncertainty in, or\npossible ranges of, fair value measurements of\nlevel 3 investments.\n\u2022 Increases in yield, discount rate,\ncapitalization rate or duration used in the\nvaluation of level 3 investments would have\nresulted in a lower fair value measurement,\nwhile increases in recovery rate or multiples\nwould have resulted in a higher fair value\nmeasurement as of both September 2022 and\nDecember 2021. Due to the distinctive nature\nof each level 3 investment, the\ninterrelationship of inputs is not necessarily\nuniform within each product type.\n\u2022 Corporate debt\nsecurities, securities\nbacked by real estate\nand other debt\nobligations are valued\nusing discounted cash\nflows, and equity\nsecurities are valued\nusing market\ncomparables and\ndiscounted cash flows.\n\u2022 The fair value of\nany one instrument may\nbe determined using\nmultiple valuation\ntechniques. For\nexample, market\ncomparables and\ndiscounted cash flows\nmay be used together\nto determine fair\nvalue. Therefore, the\nlevel 3 balance\nencompasses both of\nthese techniques. \u2022\nThe significant\nunobservable inputs\nfor recovery rate\nrelated to securities\nbacked by real estate\nas of September 2022\ndid not have a range\n(and there was no\nweighted average) as\nthey pertained to a\nsingle position.\nTherefore, such\nunobservable inputs\nare not included in\nthe table above.

To\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, the firm\nclassifies its loans\nand lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at amortized cost\ninto wholesale and\nconsumer portfolios.\nThese portfolios\nrepresent the level at\nwhich the firm has\ndeveloped and\ndocumented its\nmethodology to\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. The allowance\nfor credit losses is\nmeasured on a\ncollective basis for\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics using\na modeled approach and\non an asset-specific\nbasis for loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses takes\ninto account the\nweighted average of a\nrange of forecasts of\nfuture economic\nconditions over the\nexpected life of the\nloan and lending\ncommitments. The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios described\nbelow. The firm\napplies judgment in\nweighing individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including the\nfirm\u2019s internally\nderived economic\noutlook, market\nconsensus, recent\nmacroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses also includes\nqualitative components\nwhich allow management\nto reflect the\nuncertain nature of\neconomic forecasting,\ncapture uncertainty\nregarding model\ninputs, and account\nfor model imprecision\nand concentration\nrisk.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form       40  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See Note 18\nfor further\ninformation about\nlending commitments.\nThe following is a\ndescription of the\nmethodology used to\ncalculate the\nallowance for credit\nlosses: Wholesale. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for wholesale\nloans and lending\ncommitments that\nexhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics is\nmeasured using a\nmodeled approach.\nThese models determine\nthe probability of\ndefault and loss given\ndefault based on\nvarious risk factors,\nincluding internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators, the\nborrower\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial\nobligations, the\nborrower\u2019s country of\nrisk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. For\nlending commitments,\nthe methodology also\nconsiders probability\nof drawdowns or\nfunding. In addition,\nfor loans backed by\nreal estate, risk\nfactors include the\nloan-to-value ratio,\ndebt service ratio and\nhome price index. The\nmost significant\ninputs to the forecast\nmodel for wholesale\nloans and lending\ncommitments include\nunemployment rates,\nGDP, credit spreads,\ncommercial and\nindustrial delinquency\nrates, short- and\nlong-term interest\nrates, and oil prices.\nThe allowance for loan\nlosses for wholesale\nloans that do not\nshare similar risk\ncharacteristics, such\nas nonaccrual loans or\nloans in a TDR, is\ncalculated using the\npresent value of\nexpected future cash\nflows discounted at\nthe loan\u2019s original\neffective rate, the\nobservable market\nprice of the loan or\nthe fair value of the\ncollateral. Wholesale\nloans are charged off\nagainst the allowance\nfor loan losses when\ndeemed to be\nuncollectible.\n                                              \n  41    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for consumer\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics is\ncalculated using a\nmodeled approach which\nclassifies consumer\nloans into pools based\non borrower-related\nand exposure-related\ncharacteristics that\ndifferentiate a pool\u2019s\nrisk characteristics\nfrom other pools. The\nfactors considered in\ndetermining a pool are\ngenerally consistent\nwith the risk\ncharacteristics used\nfor internal credit\nrisk measurement and\nmanagement and include\nkey metrics, such as\nFICO credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nconsumer loans include\nunemployment rates and\ndelinquency rates. The\nexpected life of\nrevolving credit card\nloans is determined by\nmodeling expected\nfuture draws and the\ntiming and amount of\nrepayments allocated\nto the funded balance.\nThe firm also\nrecognizes an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on commitments\nto acquire loans.\nHowever, no allowance\nfor credit losses is\nrecognized on credit\ncard lending\ncommitments as they\nare cancellable by the\nfirm. The allowance\nfor credit losses for\nconsumer loans that do\nnot share similar risk\ncharacteristics, such\nas loans in a TDR, is\ncalculated using the\npresent value of\nexpected future cash\nflows discounted at\nthe loan\u2019s original\neffective rate.\nInstallment loans are\ncharged off when they\nare 120 days past due.\nCredit card loans are\ncharged off when they\nare 180 days past due.\n\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses Rollforward\nThe table below presents information about the\nallowance for credit losses.\n                                              \n  $

In this scenario, the U.S.\nunemployment rate peaks at approximately 7.4%\nduring the fourth quarter of 2023 and the\nmaximum decline in the quarterly U.S. GDP\nrelative to the third quarter of 2022 is\napproximately 2.1%, which occurs during the\nthird quarter of 2023.\nIn the table above:\n\u2022 U.S. unemployment rate represents the rate\nforecasted as of the respective quarter-end.\n\u2022 Growth in U.S. GDP represents the year-over-\nyear growth rate forecasted for the respective\nyears.\n\u2022 While the U.S.\nunemployment and U.S.\nGDP growth rates are\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model,\nthe model contemplates\na variety of other\ninputs across a range\nof scenarios to\nprovide a forecast of\nfuture economic\nconditions. Given the\ncomplex nature of the\nforecasting process,\nno single economic\nvariable can be viewed\nin isolation and\nindependently of other\ninputs.

If the\nfirm elects to\nbifurcate the embedded\nderivative from the\nassociated debt, the\nderivative is\naccounted for at fair\nvalue and the host\ncontract is accounted\nfor at amortized cost,\nadjusted for the\neffective portion of\nany fair value hedges.\nIf the firm does not\nelect to bifurcate,\nthe entire hybrid\nfinancial instrument\nis accounted for at\nfair value under the\nfair value option.\nOther financial assets\nand liabilities\naccounted for at fair\nvalue under the fair\nvalue option include:\n\u2022 Resale and\nrepurchase agreements;\n\u2022 Certain securities\nborrowed and loaned\ntransactions; \u2022\nCertain customer and\nother receivables and\ncertain other\nliabilities; \u2022 Certain\ntime deposits\n(deposits with no\nstated maturity are\nnot eligible for a\nfair value option\nelection), including\nstructured\ncertificates of\ndeposit, which are\nhybrid financial\ninstruments; \u2022\nSubstantially all\nother secured\nfinancings, including\ntransfers of assets\naccounted for as\nfinancings; and \u2022\nCertain unsecured\nshort- and long-term\nborrowings,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich are hybrid\nfinancial instruments.\n\nFair Value of Other\nFinancial Assets and\nLiabilities by Level\nThe table below\npresents, by level\nwithin the fair value\nhierarchy, other\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities at fair\nvalue, substantially\nall of which are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue under the fair\nvalue option.\n                                              \n            L\u2026        L\u2026        L\u2026            \n            1         2         3         T\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2014      $  \u2026      $  \u2014      $  \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2014         \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2014         \u2026      \n      $  \u2014      $  \u2026      $  \u2014      $  \u2026      \n                                              \n      $  \u2014      $  \u2026      $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2014         \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2014         \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2026         \u2026      \n                                              \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2026         \u2026      \n      $  \u2014      $  \u2026      $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2014      $  \u2026      $  \u2014      $  \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2014         \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2014         \u2026      \n      $  \u2014      $  \u2026      $  \u2014      $  \u2026      \n                                              \n      $  \u2014      $  \u2026      $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2014         \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2014         \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2026         \u2026      \n                                              \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2014         \u2026         \u2026         \u2026      \n      $  \u2014      $  \u2026      $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n                                              \nIn the table above,\nother financial assets\nare shown as positive\namounts and other\nfinancial liabilities\nare shown as negative\namounts.\n\nSee Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s\nfair value measurement\npolicies and the\nvaluation techniques\nand significant inputs\nused to determine the\nfair value of other\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities.\n                                              \n  47    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See\nNote 18 for further\ninformation about\nlending commitments.\n\nImpact of Credit\nSpreads on Loans and\nLending Commitments\nThe estimated net gain/(loss) attributable to\nchanges in instrument-specific credit spreads\non loans and lending commitments for which the\nfair value option was elected was $( 75)\nmillion for the three months ended September\n2022, $ 87million for the three months ended\nSeptember 2021, $( 182) million for the nine\nmonths ended September 2022 and $ 290million\nfor the nine months ended September 2021. The\nfirm generally calculates the fair value of\nloans and lending commitments for which the\nfair value option is elected by discounting\nfuture cash flows at a rate which incorporates\nthe instrument-specific credit spreads. For\nfloating-rate loans and lending commitments,\nsubstantially all changes in fair value are\nattributable to changes in instrument-specific\ncredit spreads, whereas for fixed-rate loans\nand lending commitments, changes in fair value\nare also attributable to changes in interest\nrates.\n\nNote 11. Collateralized Agreements and\nFinancings Collateralized agreements are\nresale agreements and securities borrowed.\nCollateralized financings are repurchase\nagreements, securities loaned and other\nsecured financings. The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things,\nfacilitate client activities, invest excess\ncash, acquire securities to cover short\npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings are\npresented on a net-by-counterparty basis when\na legal right of setoff exists. Interest on\ncollateralized agreements, which is included\nin interest income, and collateralized\nfinancings, which is included in interest\nexpense, is recognized over the life of the\ntransaction. See Note 23 for further\ninformation about interest income and interest\nexpense. Resale and Repurchase Agreements A\nresale agreement is a transaction in which the\nfirm purchases financial instruments from a\nseller, typically in exchange for cash, and\nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to\nresell the same or substantially the same\nfinancial instruments to the seller at a\nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. A repurchase agreement is a transaction\nin which the firm sells financial instruments\nto a buyer, typically in exchange for cash,\nand simultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same\nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a\nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale\nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d) involve the legal transfer of\nownership of financial instruments, they are\naccounted for as financing arrangements\nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the\nmaturity of the agreement. The financial\ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and\nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.\ngovernment and agency, and investment-grade\nsovereign obligations. The firm receives\nfinancial instruments purchased under resale\nagreements and makes delivery of financial\ninstruments sold under repurchase agreements.\nTo mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these financial\ninstruments on a daily basis, and delivers or\nobtains additional collateral due to changes\nin the market value of the financial\ninstruments, as appropriate. For resale\nagreements, the firm typically requires\ncollateral with a fair value approximately\nequal to the carrying value of the relevant\nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form       52  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

When the\nfirm returns the\nsecurities, the\ncounterparty returns\nthe cash or\nsecurities. Interest\nis generally paid\nperiodically over the\nlife of the\ntransaction. In a\nsecurities loaned\ntransaction, the firm\nlends securities to a\ncounterparty in\nexchange for cash or\nsecurities. When the\ncounterparty returns\nthe securities, the\nfirm returns the cash\nor securities posted\nas collateral.\nInterest is generally\npaid periodically over\nthe life of the\ntransaction. The firm\nreceives securities\nborrowed and makes\ndelivery of securities\nloaned. To mitigate\ncredit exposure, the\nfirm monitors the\nmarket value of these\nsecurities on a daily\nbasis, and delivers or\nobtains additional\ncollateral due to\nchanges in the market\nvalue of the\nsecurities, as\nappropriate. For\nsecurities borrowed\ntransactions, the firm\ntypically requires\ncollateral with a fair\nvalue approximately\nequal to the carrying\nvalue of the\nsecurities borrowed\ntransaction.\nSecurities borrowed\nand loaned within\nFixed Income, Currency\nand Commodities (FICC)\nfinancing are recorded\nat fair value under\nthe fair value option.\nSee Note 10 for\nfurther information\nabout securities\nborrowed and loaned\naccounted for at fair\nvalue. Substantially\nall of the securities\nborrowed and loaned\nwithin Equities\nfinancing are recorded\nbased on the amount of\ncash collateral\nadvanced or received\nplus accrued interest.\nThe firm also reviews\nsuch securities\nborrowed to determine\nif an allowance for\ncredit losses should\nbe recorded by taking\ninto consideration the\nfair value of\ncollateral received.\nAs these agreements\ngenerally can be\nterminated on demand,\nthey exhibit little,\nif any, sensitivity to\nchanges in interest\nrates. Therefore, the\ncarrying value of such\nagreements\napproximates fair\nvalue. As these\nagreements are not\naccounted for at fair\nvalue, they are not\nincluded in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy\nin Notes 4 through 10.\nHad these agreements\nbeen included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value\nhierarchy, they would\nhave been classified\nin level 2 as of both\nSeptember 2022 and\nDecember 2021.\n\nOffsetting\nArrangements\nThe table below presents resale and repurchase\nagreements and securities borrowed and loaned\ntransactions included in the consolidated\nbalance sheets, as well as the amounts not\noffset in the consolidated balance sheets.\n                                              \n            \u2026        \u2026          R\u2026        S\u2026  \n         \u2026  \u2026        \u2026       \u2026  a\u2026        l\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n                                              \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n                                              \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 Substantially all of the gross carrying\nvalues of these arrangements are subject to\nenforceable netting agreements.\n\u2022 Where the firm has received or posted\ncollateral under credit support agreements,\nbut has not yet determined such agreements are\nenforceable, the related collateral has not\nbeen netted.\n\u2022 Amounts not offset includes counterparty\nnetting that does not meet the criteria for\nnetting under U.S. GAAP and the fair value of\ncollateral received or posted subject to\nenforceable credit support agreements.\n\u2022 Resale agreements and repurchase agreements\nare carried at fair value under the fair value\noption.

The\nfirm has elected to\napply the fair value\noption to\nsubstantially all\nother secured\nfinancings because the\nuse of fair value\neliminates non-\neconomic volatility in\nearnings that would\narise from using\ndifferent measurement\nattributes. See Note\n10 for further\ninformation about\nother secured\nfinancings that are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue. Other secured\nfinancings that are\nnot recorded at fair\nvalue are recorded\nbased on the amount of\ncash received plus\naccrued interest,\nwhich generally\napproximates fair\nvalue.

When assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its estimated\ncarrying value. If the\nresults of the\nqualitative assessment\nare not conclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment. The\nquantitative goodwill\ntest compares the\nestimated fair value\nof each reporting unit\nwith its estimated net\nbook value (including\ngoodwill and\nidentifiable\nintangible assets). If\nthe reporting unit\u2019s\nestimated fair value\nexceeds its estimated\nnet book value,\ngoodwill is not\nimpaired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated fair value\nof a reporting unit is\nless than its\nestimated net book\nvalue. To estimate the\nfair value of each\nreporting unit, other\nthan Consumer banking,\na relative value\ntechnique is used\nbecause the firm\nbelieves market\nparticipants would use\nthis technique to\nvalue these reporting\nunits. The relative\nvalue technique\napplies observable\nprice-to-earnings\nmultiples or price-to-\nbook multiples of\ncomparable competitors\nto reporting units\u2019\nnet earnings or net\nbook value. To\nestimate the fair\nvalue of Consumer\nbanking, a discounted\ncash flow valuation\napproach is used\nbecause the firm\nbelieves market\nparticipants would use\nthis technique to\nvalue that reporting\nunit given its early\nstage of development.\nThe estimated net\ncarrying value of each\nreporting unit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\n                                              \n  57    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Multiple\nfactors, including\nperformance\nindicators,\nmacroeconomic\nindicators, firm and\nindustry events, and\nfair value indicators,\nwere assessed with\nrespect to each of the\nfirm\u2019s reporting units\nto determine whether\nit was more likely\nthan not that the\nestimated fair value\nof any of those\nreporting units was\nless than its\nestimated carrying\nvalue. The qualitative\nassessment also\nconsidered changes\nsince a quantitative\ntest was last\nperformed in 2019. As\na result of the\nqualitative\nassessment, the firm\ndetermined that it was\nmore likely than not\nthat the estimated\nfair value of each\nreporting unit\nexceeded its\nrespective estimated\ncarrying value.\nTherefore, the firm\ndetermined that\ngoodwill for each\nreporting unit was not\nimpaired and that a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest was not required.\nBased on the\nevaluation of relevant\nfactors during the\nfirst nine months of\n2022, the firm\ndetermined that it was\nmore likely than not\nthat the estimated\nfair value of each of\nthe reporting

For leases\nlonger than one year,\nthe firm recognizes a\nright-of-use asset\nrepresenting the right\nto use the underlying\nasset for the lease\nterm, and a lease\nliability representing\nthe liability to make\npayments. The lease\nterm is generally\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual\nmaturity of the lease.\nFor leases where the\nfirm has the option to\nterminate or extend\nthe lease, an\nassessment of the\nlikelihood of\nexercising the option\nis incorporated into\nthe determination of\nthe lease term. Such\nassessment is\ninitially performed at\nthe inception of the\nlease and is updated\nif events occur that\nimpact the original\nassessment. An\noperating lease right-\nof-use asset is\ninitially determined\nbased on the operating\nlease liability,\nadjusted for initial\ndirect costs, lease\nincentives and amounts\npaid at or prior to\nlease commencement.\nThis amount is then\namortized over the\nlease term. Right-of-\nuse assets and\noperating lease\nliabilities recognized\n(in non-cash\ntransactions for\nleases entered into or\nassumed) by the firm\nwere $ 52million for\nthe three months ended\nSeptember 2022, $\n86million for the\nthree months ended\nSeptember 2021, $\n168million for the\nnine months ended\nSeptember 2022 and $\n230million for the\nnine months ended\nSeptember 2021.

Expected credit\nloss assumptions are\nreflected in the\ndiscount rate for the\nremainder of retained\ninterests.\nThe firm has other retained interests not\nreflected in the table above with a fair value\nof $ 408million and a weighted average life of\n6.1years as of September 2022, and a fair\nvalue of $ 360million and a weighted average\nlife of 3.6years as of December 2021. Due to\nthe nature and fair value of certain of these\nretained interests, the weighted average\nassumptions for constant prepayment and\ndiscount rates and the related sensitivity to\nadverse changes are not meaningful as of both\nSeptember 2022 and December 2021. The firm\u2019s\nmaximum exposure to adverse changes in the\nvalue of these interests is the carrying value\nof $ 425million as of September 2022 and $\n360million as of December 2021.\n\nNote 17. Variable Interest Entities A variable\ninterest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt\nor equity) or other interest (e.g.,\nderivatives or loans and lending commitments)\nthat will absorb portions of the VIE\u2019s\nexpected losses and/or receive portions of the\nVIE\u2019s expected residual returns. The firm\u2019s\nvariable interests in VIEs include senior and\nsubordinated debt; loans and lending\ncommitments; limited and general partnership\ninterests; preferred and common equity;\nderivatives that may include foreign currency,\nequity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and\ncertain of the fees the firm receives from\ninvestment funds. Certain interest rate,\nforeign currency and credit derivatives the\nfirm enters into with VIEs are not variable\ninterests because they create, rather than\nabsorb, risk. VIEs generally finance the\npurchase of assets by issuing debt and equity\nsecurities that are either collateralized by\nor indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The\ndebt and equity securities issued by a VIE may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. The firm\u2019s involvement with\nVIEs includes securitization of financial\nassets, as described in Note 16, and\ninvestments in and loans to other types of\nVIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the\nfirm\u2019s consolidation policies, including the\ndefinition of a VIE. VIE Consolidation\nAnalysis The enterprise with a controlling\nfinancial interest in a VIE is known as the\nprimary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE.\nThe firm determines whether it is the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis\nthat principally considers: \u2022 Which variable\ninterest holder has the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly\nimpact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; \u2022 Which\nvariable interest holder has the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s purpose\nand design, including the risks the VIE was\ndesigned to create and pass through to its\nvariable interest holders; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s capital\nstructure; \u2022 The terms between the VIE and its\nvariable interest holders and other parties\ninvolved with the VIE; and \u2022 Related-party\nrelationships.\n                                              \n  65    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

VIE\nActivities The firm is\nprincipally involved\nwith VIEs through the\nfollowing business\nactivities: Mortgage-\nBacked VIEs. The firm\nsells residential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans and securities\nto mortgage-backed\nVIEs and may retain\nbeneficial interests\nin the assets sold to\nthese VIEs. The firm\npurchases and sells\nbeneficial interests\nissued by mortgage-\nbacked VIEs in\nconnection with\nmarket-making\nactivities. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into derivatives\nwith certain of these\nVIEs, primarily\ninterest rate swaps,\nwhich are typically\nnot variable\ninterests. The firm\ngenerally enters into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk.\nReal Estate, Credit-\nand Power-Related and\nOther Investing VIEs.\nThe firm purchases\nequity and debt\nsecurities issued by\nand makes loans to\nVIEs that hold real\nestate, performing and\nnonperforming debt,\ndistressed loans,\npower-related assets\nand equity securities.\nThe firm generally\ndoes not sell assets\nto, or enter into\nderivatives with,\nthese VIEs. Corporate\nDebt and Other Asset-\nBacked VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue notes to\nclients, purchases and\nsells beneficial\ninterests issued by\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs in connection\nwith market-making\nactivities, and makes\nloans to VIEs that\nwarehouse corporate\ndebt. Certain of these\nVIEs synthetically\ncreate the exposure\nfor the beneficial\ninterests they issue\nby entering into\ncredit derivatives\nwith the firm, rather\nthan purchasing the\nunderlying assets. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into\nderivatives, such as\ntotal return swaps,\nwith certain corporate\ndebt and other asset-\nbacked VIEs, under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE a return due\nto the beneficial\ninterest holders and\nreceives the return on\nthe collateral owned\nby the VIE. The\ncollateral owned by\nthese VIEs is\nprimarily other asset-\nbacked loans and\nsecurities. The firm\nmay be removed as the\ntotal return swap\ncounterparty and may\nenter into derivatives\nwith other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk\nrelated to these\nswaps. The firm may\nsell assets to the\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs it structures.\n\nPrincipal-Protected\nNote VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs\nown portfolios of\nassets, principally\nwith exposure to hedge\nfunds. Substantially\nall of the principal\nprotection on the\nnotes issued by these\nVIEs is provided by\nthe asset portfolio\nrebalancing that is\nrequired under the\nterms of the notes.\nThe firm enters into\ntotal return swaps\nwith these VIEs under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE the return due\nto the principal-\nprotected note holders\nand receives the\nreturn on the assets\nowned by the VIE. The\nfirm may enter into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk. The\nfirm also obtains\nfunding through these\nVIEs. Investments in\nFunds. The firm makes\nequity investments in\ncertain investment\nfund VIEs it manages\nand is entitled to\nreceive fees from\nthese VIEs. The firm\nhas generally not sold\nassets to, or entered\ninto derivatives with,\nthese VIEs.\nNonconsolidated VIEs\nThe table below presents a summary of the\nnonconsolidated VIEs in which the firm holds\nvariable interests.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  mil\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  non\u2026              Septe\u2026            Decem\u2026  \n  VIEs       As of  2022              2021    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Ass\u2026                                        \n  in      $  184,\u2026          $  176,\u2026          \n  VIEs                                        \n  Car\u2026                                        \n  val\u2026                                        \n  of                                          \n  var\u2026    $  12,0\u2026          $  9,582          \n  int\u2026                                        \n  \u2014                                           \n  ass\u2026                                        \n  Car\u2026                                        \n  val\u2026                                        \n  of                                          \n  var\u2026    $    791          $    928          \n  int\u2026                                        \n  \u2014                                           \n  lia\u2026                                        \n  Max\u2026                                        \n  exp\u2026                                        \n  to                                          \n  los\u2026                                        \n  Ret\u2026    $  4,908          $  3,552          \n  int\u2026                                        \n  Pur\u2026         916             1,071          \n  int\u2026                                        \n  Com\u2026                                        \n  and        2,642             2,440          \n  gua\u2026                                        \n  Der\u2026       8,128             8,682          \n  Debt                                        \n  and        5,887             4,639          \n  equ\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026    $  22,4\u2026          $  20,3\u2026          \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 The nature of the firm\u2019s variable interests\nis described in the rows under maximum\nexposure to loss.\n\u2022 The firm\u2019s exposure to the obligations of\nVIEs is generally limited to its interests in\nthese entities.

The carrying value of lending\ncommitments held for sale was a liability of $\n130million as of September 2022 and $\n91million as of December 2021. The estimated\nfair value of such lending commitments\napproximates the carrying value. Had these\nlending commitments been included in the fair\nvalue hierarchy, they would have been\nprimarily classified in level 3 as of both\nSeptember 2022 and December 2021.\n\u2022 Gains or losses\nrelated to lending\ncommitments at fair\nvalue, if any, are\ngenerally recorded net\nof any fees in other\nprincipal\ntransactions.\nCommercial Lending.\nThe firm\u2019s commercial\nlending commitments\nwere primarily\nextended to\ninvestment-grade\ncorporate borrowers.\nSuch commitments\nprimarily included $\n123.83billion as of\nSeptember 2022 and $\n120.99billion as of\nDecember 2021, related\nto relationship\nlending activities\n(principally used for\noperating and general\ncorporate purposes),\nand $ 10.27billion as\nof September 2022 and\n$ 21.07billion as of\nDecember 2021, related\nto other investment\nbanking activities\n(generally extended\nfor contingent\nacquisition financing\nand are often intended\nto be short-term in\nnature, as borrowers\noften seek to replace\nthem with other\nfunding sources). The\nfirm also extends\nlending commitments in\nconnection with other\ntypes of corporate\nlending, as well as\ncommercial real estate\nfinancing. See Note 9\nfor further\ninformation about\nfunded loans.\n\nTo mitigate the credit\nrisk associated with\nthe firm\u2019s commercial\nlending activities,\nthe firm obtains\ncredit protection on\ncertain loans and\nlending commitments\nthrough credit default\nswaps, both single-\nname and index-based\ncontracts, and through\nthe issuance of\ncredit-linked notes.\nWarehouse Financing.\nThe firm provides\nfinancing to clients\nwho warehouse\nfinancial assets.\nThese arrangements are\nsecured by the\nwarehoused assets,\nprimarily consisting\nof residential real\nestate, consumer and\ncorporate loans.\nConsumer.

See the tables in\n\u201cCommitments\u201d above for a summary of the\nfirm\u2019s commitments.\n\u2022 The carrying value\nfor derivatives\nincluded derivative\nassets of $ 682million\nas of September 2022\nand $ 1.10billion as\nof December 2021, and\nderivative liabilities\nof $ 8.53billion as of\nSeptember 2022 and $\n4.51billion as of\nDecember 2021.\nDerivative Guarantees.\nThe firm enters into\nvarious derivatives\nthat meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee under U.S.\nGAAP, including\nwritten equity and\ncommodity put options,\nwritten currency\ncontracts and interest\nrate caps, floors and\nswaptions. These\nderivatives are risk\nmanaged together with\nderivatives that do\nnot meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, and\ntherefore the amounts\nin the table above do\nnot reflect the firm\u2019s\noverall risk related\nto derivative\nactivities.\nDisclosures about\nderivatives are not\nrequired if they may\nbe cash settled and\nthe firm has no basis\nto conclude it is\nprobable that the\ncounterparties held\nthe underlying\ninstruments at the\ninception of the\ncontract. The firm has\nconcluded that these\nconditions have been\nmet for certain large,\ninternationally active\ncommercial and\ninvestment bank\ncounterparties,\ncentral clearing\ncounterparties, hedge\nfunds and certain\nother counterparties.\nAccordingly, the firm\nhas not included such\ncontracts in the table\nabove. See Note 7 for\ninformation about\ncredit derivatives\nthat meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, which are\nnot included in the\ntable above.\nDerivatives are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue and therefore\nthe carrying value is\nconsidered the best\nindication of\npayment/performance\nrisk for individual\ncontracts. However,\nthe carrying values in\nthe table above\nexclude the effect of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting.\nSecurities Lending and\nClearing Guarantees .\nSecurities lending and\nclearing guarantees\ninclude the\nindemnifications and\nguarantees that the\nfirm provides in its\ncapacity as an agency\nlender and in its\ncapacity as a\nsponsoring member of\nthe Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation.\nAs an agency lender,\nthe firm indemnifies\nmost of its securities\nlending customers\nagainst losses\nincurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not\nreturn securities and\nthe collateral held is\ninsufficient to cover\nthe market value of\nthe securities\nborrowed. The maximum\npayout of such\nindemnifications was $\n14.04billion as of\nSeptember 2022 and $\n11.05billion as of\nDecember 2021.\nCollateral held by the\nlenders in connection\nwith securities\nlending\nindemnifications was $\n14.50billion as of\nSeptember 2022 and $\n11.36billion as of\nDecember 2021. Because\nthe contractual nature\nof these arrangements\nrequires the firm to\nobtain collateral with\na market value that\nexceeds the value of\nthe securities lent to\nthe borrower, there is\nminimal performance\nrisk associated with\nthese\nindemnifications.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form       70  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nAs a sponsoring member of the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the\nperformance of its sponsored member clients to\nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in\nconnection with certain resale and repurchase\nagreements. To minimize potential losses on\nsuch guarantees, the firm obtains a security\ninterest in the collateral that the sponsored\nclient placed with the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on\nsuch guarantees is minimal. There were no\namounts outstanding under the guarantee as of\nboth September 2022 and December 2021. Other\nFinancial Guarantees . In the ordinary course\nof business, the firm provides other financial\nguarantees of the obligations of third parties\n(e.g., standby letters of credit and other\nguarantees to enable clients to complete\ntransactions and fund-related guarantees).\nThese guarantees represent obligations to make\npayments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed\nparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a\ncontractual arrangement with that beneficiary.\nOther financial guarantees also include a\nguarantee that the firm has provided to the\nGovernment of Malaysia that it will receive,\nby August 2025, at least $ 1.4billion in\nassets and proceeds from assets seized by\ngovernmental authorities around the world\nrelated to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a\nsovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In\nconnection with this guarantee, the firm is\nalso required to make a one-time interim\npayment of $ 250million towards the $\n1.4billion if the Government of Malaysia has\nnot received at least $ 500million in assets\nand proceeds by August 2022. The firm\nconsiders the reports that it receives on a\nsemi-annual basis, expected in February and\nAugust, in evaluating the progress of\nMalaysia\u2019s recovery efforts. In the latest\nreport as of August 2022, the Government of\nMalaysia unilaterally reduced the value of one\nasset previously included in its prior reports\nby $ 80million and declined to include\nsubstantial additional assets in its\naccounting of assets and proceeds recovered.\nThe firm and the Government of Malaysia\ndisagree about, and continue to discuss,\nwhether the Government of Malaysia did, in\nfact, recover at least $ 500million as of\nAugust 2022 and whether any interim payment\nwas due. Pursuant to their August 2020\nagreement, the parties have a three-month\nperiod to try to resolve this dispute, which\nhas commenced. If the parties are unable to\nreach such a resolution, this dispute would be\nsettled by arbitration. Any amounts paid by\nthe firm would, in any event, be subject to\nreimbursement in the event the assets and\nproceeds received by the Government of\nMalaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed $\n1.4billion. See Note 27 for further\ninformation about matters related to 1MDB.\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The\nfirm has established trusts, including Goldman\nSachs Capital I, Goldman Sachs Capital II and\nGoldman Sachs Capital III (the Trusts), and\nother entities, for the limited purpose of\nissuing securities to third parties, lending\nthe proceeds to the firm and entering into\ncontractual arrangements with the firm and\nthird parties related to this purpose. The\nfirm does not consolidate these entities. See\nNotes 14 and 19 for further information about\nthe transactions involving the Trusts. The\nfirm effectively provides for the full and\nunconditional guarantee of the securities\nissued by these entities. Timely payment by\nthe firm of amounts due to these entities\nunder the guarantee, borrowing, preferred\nstock and related contractual arrangements\nwill be sufficient to cover payments due on\nthe securities issued by these entities. No\nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the\nsecurities of the Trusts. Management believes\nthat it is unlikely that any circumstances\nwill occur, such as nonperformance on the part\nof paying agents or other service providers,\nthat would make it necessary for the firm to\nmake payments related to these entities other\nthan those required under the terms of the\nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and\nrelated contractual arrangements and in\nconnection with certain expenses incurred by\nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of\nService Providers. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees\ncertain service providers, such as clearing\nand custody agents, trustees and\nadministrators, against specified potential\nlosses in connection with their acting as an\nagent of, or providing services to, the firm\nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses\narising from its custodial role or caused by\nacts or omissions of third-party service\nproviders, including sub-custodians and third-\nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has\nthe right to seek indemnification from these\nthird-party service providers for certain\nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In\naddition, the firm is a member of payment,\nclearing and settlement networks, as well as\nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of\nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of\nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In\nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear\nand settle transactions entered into by\nclients with other brokerage firms. The firm\u2019s\nobligations in respect of such transactions\nare secured by the assets in the client\u2019s\naccount and proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the firm\non behalf of the client. In connection with\njoint venture investments, the firm may issue\nloan guarantees under which it may be liable\nin the event of fraud, misappropriation,\nenvironmental liabilities and other matters\ninvolving the borrower.\n                                              \n  71    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Other\nRepresentations,\nWarranties and\nIndemnifications. The\nfirm provides\nrepresentations and\nwarranties to\ncounterparties in\nconnection with a\nvariety of commercial\ntransactions and\noccasionally\nindemnifies them\nagainst potential\nlosses caused by the\nbreach of those\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. The firm\nmay also provide\nindemnifications\nprotecting against\nchanges in or adverse\napplication of certain\nU.S. tax laws in\nconnection with\nordinary-course\ntransactions, such as\nsecurities issuances,\nborrowings or\nderivatives. In\naddition, the firm may\nprovide\nindemnifications to\nsome counterparties to\nprotect them in the\nevent additional taxes\nare owed or payments\nare withheld, due\neither to a change in\nor an adverse\napplication of certain\nnon-U.S. tax laws.\nThese indemnifications\ngenerally are standard\ncontractual terms and\nare entered into in\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness. Generally,\nthere are no stated or\nnotional amounts\nincluded in these\nindemnifications, and\nthe contingencies\ntriggering the\nobligation to\nindemnify are not\nexpected to occur. The\nfirm is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder these guarantees\nand indemnifications.\nHowever, management\nbelieves that it is\nunlikely the firm will\nhave to make any\nmaterial payments\nunder these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\narrangements have been\nrecognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both\nSeptember 2022 and\nDecember 2021.\nGuarantees of\nSubsidiaries. Group\nInc. is the entity\nthat fully and\nunconditionally\nguarantees the\nsecurities issued by\nGS Finance Corp., a\nwholly-owned finance\nsubsidiary of the\nfirm.

In\naddition, Group Inc.\nhas provided\nguarantees to Goldman\nSachs International\n(GSI) and GSBE related\nto agreements that\neach entity has\nentered into with\ncertain of its\ncounterparties. Group\nInc. guarantees many\nof the obligations of\nits other consolidated\nsubsidiaries on a\ntransaction-by-\ntransaction basis, as\nnegotiated with\ncounterparties. Group\nInc. is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder its subsidiary\nguarantees.

Regulation and Capital Adequacy The\nFRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a\nbank holding company under the U.S. Bank\nHolding Company Act of 1956 and a financial\nholding company under amendments to this Act.\nThe firm is subject to consolidated regulatory\ncapital requirements which are calculated in\naccordance with the regulations of the FRB\n(Capital Framework). The capital requirements\nare expressed as risk-based capital and\nleverage ratios that compare measures of\nregulatory capital to risk-weighted assets\n(RWAs), average assets and off-balance sheet\nexposures. Failure to comply with these\ncapital requirements would result in\nrestrictions being imposed by the firm\u2019s\nregulators and could limit the firm\u2019s ability\nto repurchase shares, pay dividends and make\ncertain discretionary compensation payments.\nThe firm\u2019s capital levels are also subject to\nqualitative judgments by the regulators about\ncomponents of capital, risk weightings and\nother factors. Furthermore, certain of the\nfirm\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to separate\nregulations and capital requirements. Capital\nFramework The regulations under the Capital\nFramework are largely based on the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision\u2019s (Basel\nCommittee) capital framework for strengthening\ninternational capital standards (Basel III)\nand also implement certain provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework,\nthe firm is an \u201cAdvanced approaches\u201d banking\norganization and has been designated as a\nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB).\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum\nrisk-based capital and the capital\nconservation buffer requirements. The buffer\nmust consist entirely of capital that\nqualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)\ncapital. The firm calculates its CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in\naccordance with both the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules.

For\nrisk management\npurposes, a 95% one-\ndayVaR is used,\nwhereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements,\na 99% 10-dayVaR is\nused to determine\nMarket RWAs and a 99%\none-dayVaR is used to\ndetermine regulatory\nVaR exceptions. In\naddition, the daily\nnet revenues used to\ndetermine risk\nmanagement VaR\nexceptions (i.e.,\ncomparing the daily\nnet revenues to the\nVaR measure calculated\nas of the end of the\nprior business day)\ninclude intraday\nactivity, whereas the\nCapital Framework\nrequires that intraday\nactivity be excluded\nfrom daily net\nrevenues when\ncalculating regulatory\nVaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity\nincludes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are\nmore likely than not\nto be positive by\ntheir nature. As a\nresult, there may be\ndifferences in the\nnumber of VaR\nexceptions and the\namount of daily net\nrevenues calculated\nfor regulatory VaR\ncompared to the\namounts calculated for\nrisk management VaR.\nThe firm\u2019s positional\nlosses observed on a\nsingle day exceeded\nits 99% one-\ndayregulatory VaR on\none occasion during\neach of the nine\nmonths ended September\n2022 and the year\nended 2021. There was\nno change in the\nfirm\u2019s VaR multiplier\nused to calculate\nMarket RWAs; \u2022\nStressed VaR is the\npotential loss in\nvalue of trading\nassets and\nliabilities, as well\nas certain\ninvestments, loans,\nand other financial\nassets and liabilities\naccounted for at fair\nvalue, during a period\nof significant market\nstress; \u2022 Incremental\nrisk is the potential\nloss in value of non-\nsecuritized positions\ndue to the default or\ncredit migration of\nissuers of financial\ninstruments over a\none-year time horizon;\n\u2022 Comprehensive risk\nis the potential loss\nin value, due to price\nrisk and defaults,\nwithin the firm\u2019s\ncredit correlation\npositions; and \u2022\nSpecific risk is the\nrisk of loss on a\nposition that could\nresult from factors\nother than broad\nmarket movements,\nincluding event risk,\ndefault risk and\nidiosyncratic risk.\nThe standardized\nmeasurement method is\nused to determine\nspecific risk RWAs, by\napplying supervisory\ndefined risk-weighting\nfactors after\napplicable netting is\nperformed.\n\nOperational Risk\nOperational RWAs are\nonly required to be\nincluded under the\nAdvanced Capital\nRules. The firm\nutilizes an internal\nrisk-based model to\nquantify Operational\nRWAs.\nThe table below presents information about\nRWAs.\n                                              \n  $ in             Stand\u2026            Advanc\u2026  \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  As of                                       \n  Sept\u2026                                       \n  2022                                        \n  Cred\u2026                                       \n  RWAs                                        \n  Deri\u2026    $168,\u2026            $122,\u2026           \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  guar\u2026    242,5\u2026            179,6\u2026           \n  and                                         \n  loans                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  fina\u2026    77,807            22,339           \n  tran\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026    31,527            33,165           \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Other    81,992            96,202           \n  Total                                       \n  Cred\u2026    602,0\u2026            453,9\u2026           \n  RWAs                                        \n  Mark\u2026                                       \n  RWAs                                        \n  Regu\u2026    22,156            22,156           \n  VaR                                         \n  Stre\u2026    36,208            36,208           \n  VaR                                         \n  Incr\u2026     9,324             9,324           \n  risk                                        \n  Comp\u2026     3,485             3,485           \n  risk                                        \n  Spec\u2026    15,325            15,325           \n  risk                                        \n  Total                                       \n  Mark\u2026    86,498            86,498           \n  RWAs                                        \n  Total                                       \n  Oper\u2026         \u2014            134,6\u2026           \n  RWAs                                        \n  Total    $688,\u2026            $675,\u2026           \n  RWAs                                        \n  As of                                       \n  Dece\u2026                                       \n  2021                                        \n  Cred\u2026                                       \n  RWAs                                        \n  Deri\u2026    $175,\u2026            $109,\u2026           \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  guar\u2026    233,6\u2026            182,2\u2026           \n  and                                         \n  loans                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  fina\u2026    76,346            14,407           \n  tran\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026    43,256            45,582           \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Other    71,485            86,768           \n  Total                                       \n  Cred\u2026    600,3\u2026            438,4\u2026           \n  RWAs                                        \n  Mark\u2026                                       \n  RWAs                                        \n  Regu\u2026    13,510            13,510           \n  VaR                                         \n  Stre\u2026    38,922            38,922           \n  VaR                                         \n  Incr\u2026     6,867             6,867           \n  risk                                        \n  Comp\u2026     2,521             2,521           \n  risk                                        \n  Spec\u2026    14,689            14,689           \n  risk                                        \n  Total                                       \n  Mark\u2026    76,509            76,509           \n  RWAs                                        \n  Total                                       \n  Oper\u2026         \u2014            132,9\u2026           \n  RWAs                                        \n  Total    $676,\u2026            $647,\u2026           \n  RWAs                                        \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 Securities financing transactions represents\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowed and loaned transactions.\n\u2022 Other includes\nreceivables, certain\ndebt securities, cash\nand cash equivalents,\nand other assets.\n                                              \n  79    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Income Taxes Provision for Income\nTaxes Income taxes are provided for using the\nasset and liability method under which\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. The firm reports\ninterest expense related to income tax matters\nin provision for taxes and income tax\npenalties in other expenses. Deferred Income\nTaxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net\ntax effects of temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. These temporary\ndifferences result in taxable or deductible\namounts in future years and are measured using\nthe tax rates and laws that will be in effect\nwhen such differences are expected to reverse.\nValuation allowances are established to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount that more\nlikely than not will be realized and primarily\nrelate to the ability to utilize losses in\nvarious tax jurisdictions. Tax assets are\nincluded in other assets and tax liabilities\nare included in other liabilities.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits The firm recognizes\ntax positions in the consolidated financial\nstatements only when it is more likely than\nnot that the position will be sustained on\nexamination by the relevant taxing authority\nbased on the technical merits of the position.\nA position that meets this standard is\nmeasured at the largest amount of benefit that\nwill more likely than not be realized on\nsettlement. A liability is established for\ndifferences between positions taken in a tax\nreturn and amounts recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Regulatory\nTax Examinations The firm is subject to\nexamination by the U.S. Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) and other taxing authorities in\njurisdictions where the firm has significant\nbusiness operations, such as the United\nKingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states,\nsuch as New York. The tax years under\nexamination vary by jurisdiction. The firm\ndoes not expect completion of these audits to\nhave a material impact on the firm\u2019s financial\ncondition, but it may be material to operating\nresults for a particular period, depending, in\npart, on the operating results for that\nperiod.\n                                              \n  85    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Business Segments The firm reports\nits activities in fourbusiness segments:\nInvestment Banking, Global Markets, Asset\nManagement and Consumer & Wealth Management.\nSee Note 1 for information about the firm\u2019s\nbusiness segments. Beginning with the fourth\nquarter of 2022, consistent with the firm's\nannounced organizational changes that will\nbecome effective in December 2022, the firm\nwill make certain changes to its business\nsegments and report its results in the\nfollowing three business segments: Global\nBanking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management\nand Platform Solutions. Compensation and\nbenefits expenses in the firm\u2019s segments\nreflect, among other factors, the overall\nperformance of the firm, as well as the\nperformance of individual businesses.\nConsequently, pre-tax margins in one segment\nof the firm\u2019s business may be significantly\naffected by the performance of the firm\u2019s\nother business segments. The firm allocates\nassets (including allocations of global core\nliquid assets and cash, secured client\nfinancing and other assets), revenues and\nexpenses among the four business segments. Due\nto the integrated nature of these segments,\nestimates and judgments are made in allocating\ncertain assets, revenues and expenses. The\nallocation process is based on the manner in\nwhich management currently views the\nperformance of the segments. The allocation of\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity and preferred\nstock dividends to each segment is based on\nthe estimated amount of equity required to\nsupport the activities of the segment under\nrelevant regulatory capital requirements. Net\nearnings for each segment is calculated by\napplying the firmwide tax rate to each\nsegment\u2019s pre-tax earnings. Management\nbelieves that this allocation provides a\nreasonable representation of each segment\u2019s\ncontribution to consolidated net earnings to\ncommon, return on average common equity and\ntotal assets.

These\nactivities expose the\nfirm to many different\nindustries and\ncounterparties, and\nmay also subject the\nfirm to a\nconcentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular central\nbank, counterparty,\nborrower or issuer,\nincluding sovereign\nissuers, or to a\nparticular clearing\nhouse or exchange. The\nfirm seeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by\nactively monitoring\nexposures and\nobtaining collateral\nfrom counterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm\nconsiders when\ndetermining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts. Netting and\ncollateral agreements\npermit the firm to\noffset receivables and\npayables with such\ncounterparties and/or\nenable the firm to\nobtain collateral on\nan upfront or\ncontingent basis.\nThe table below\npresents the credit\nconcentrations\nincluded in trading\ncash instruments and\ninvestments.\n                                              \n  $ in              Septe\u2026            Decem\u2026  \n  mil\u2026       As of  2022              2021    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S.                                        \n  gov\u2026                                        \n  and     $  185,\u2026          $  141,\u2026          \n  age\u2026                                        \n  obl\u2026                                        \n  Per\u2026                                        \n  of          11.9  %            9.6  %       \n  tot\u2026                                        \n  ass\u2026                                        \n  Non\u2026                                        \n  gov\u2026                                        \n  and     $  71,7\u2026          $  51,4\u2026          \n  age\u2026                                        \n  obl\u2026                                        \n  Per\u2026                                        \n  of           4.6  %            3.5  %       \n  tot\u2026                                        \n  ass\u2026                                        \n                                              \nIn addition, the firm\nhad $ 245.63billion as\nof September 2022 and\n$ 222.20billion as of\nDecember 2021 of cash\ndeposits held at\ncentral banks\n(included in cash and\ncash equivalents), of\nwhich $ 161.28billion\nas of September 2022\nand $ 122.01billion as\nof December 2021 was\nheld at the Federal\nReserve.\nAs of both September\n2022 and December\n2021, the firm did not\nhave credit exposure\nto any other\ncounterparty that\nexceeded 2% of total\nassets.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form       88  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Note 27.\nLegal Proceedings The firm is involved in a\nnumber of judicial, regulatory and arbitration\nproceedings (including those described below)\nconcerning matters arising in connection with\nthe conduct of the firm\u2019s businesses. Many of\nthese proceedings are in early stages, and\nmany of these cases seek an indeterminate\namount of damages. Under ASC 450, an event is\n\u201creasonably possible\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the\nfuture event or events occurring is more than\nremote but less than likely\u201d and an event is\n\u201cremote\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the future event or\nevents occurring is slight.\u201d Thus, references\nto the upper end of the range of reasonably\npossible loss for cases in which the firm is\nable to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible loss mean the upper end of the range\nof loss for cases for which the firm believes\nthe risk of loss is more than slight.\n\nWith respect to matters described below for\nwhich management has been able to estimate a\nrange of reasonably possible loss where (i)\nactual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an\namount of money damages, (ii) the firm is\nbeing, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers\nin a securities offering and is not being\nindemnified by a party that the firm believes\nwill pay the full amount of any judgment, or\n(iii) the purchasers are demanding that the\nfirm repurchase securities, management has\nestimated the upper end of the range of\nreasonably possible loss based on (a) in the\ncase of (i), the amount of money damages\nclaimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the\ndifference between the initial sales price of\nthe securities that the firm sold in such\noffering and the estimated lowest subsequent\nprice of such securities prior to the action\nbeing commenced and (c) in the case of (iii),\nthe price that purchasers paid for the\nsecurities less the estimated value, if any,\nas of September 2022 of the relevant\nsecurities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and\n(iii), taking into account any other factors\nbelieved to be relevant to the particular\nmatter or matters of that type. As of the date\nhereof, the firm has estimated the upper end\nof the range of reasonably possible aggregate\nloss for such matters and for any other\nmatters described below where management has\nbeen able to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible aggregate loss to be approximately $\n2.3billion in excess of the aggregate reserves\nfor such matters. Management is generally\nunable to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible loss for matters other than those\nincluded in the estimate above, including\nwhere (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have\nnot claimed an amount of money damages, except\nin those instances where management can\notherwise determine an appropriate amount,\n(ii) matters are in early stages, (iii)\nmatters relate to regulatory investigations or\nreviews, except in those instances where\nmanagement can otherwise determine an\nappropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty\nas to the likelihood of a class being\ncertified or the ultimate size of the class,\n(v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of\npending appeals or motions, (vi) there are\nsignificant factual issues to be resolved,\nand/or (vii) there are novel legal issues\npresented. For example, the firm\u2019s potential\nliabilities with respect to the investigations\nand reviews described below in \u201cRegulatory\nInvestigations and Reviews and Related\nLitigation\u201d generally are not included in\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible\nloss. However, management does not believe,\nbased on currently available information, that\nthe outcomes of such other matters will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the firm\u2019s\nfinancial condition, though the outcomes could\nbe material to the firm\u2019s operating results\nfor any particular period, depending, in part,\nupon the operating results for such period.\n                                              \n  89    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

On November 1, 2018,\nthe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed\na criminal information and guilty plea by Tim\nLeissner, a former participating managing\ndirector of the firm, and an indictment\nagainst Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing\ndirector of the firm. On August 28, 2018,\nLeissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork of conspiring to launder money and to\nviolate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct\u2019s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal\naccounting controls provisions. Ng was charged\nwith conspiring to launder money and to\nviolate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery and internal\naccounting controls provisions. On April 8,\n2022, Ng was found guilty on all counts\nfollowing a trial. On August 18, 2020, the\nfirm announced that it entered into a\nsettlement agreement with the Government of\nMalaysia to resolve the criminal and\nregulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving\nthe firm, which includes a guarantee that the\nGovernment of Malaysia receives at least $\n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets\nseized by governmental authorities around the\nworld related to 1MDB. See Note 18 for further\ninformation about this guarantee. On October\n22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached\nsettlements of governmental and regulatory\ninvestigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ,\nthe SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the FCA, the PRA,\nthe Singapore Attorney General\u2019s Chambers, the\nSingapore Commercial Affairs Department, the\nMonetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong\nKong Securities and Futures Commission. Group\nInc. entered into a three-year deferred\nprosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a\ncharge against the firm, one count of\nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and\nwill later be dismissed if the firm abides by\nthe terms of the agreement.

The complaint alleges a class\nconsisting of all female employees employed at\nspecified levels in specified areas by Group\nInc. and GS&Co. since July 2002, and asserts\nclaims under federal and New York City\ndiscrimination laws. The complaint seeks class\naction status, injunctive relief and\nunspecified amounts of compensatory, punitive\nand other damages. On March 30, 2018, the\ndistrict court certified a damages class as to\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 disparate impact and treatment\nclaims. On September 4, 2018, the U.S. Court\nof Appeals for the Second Circuit denied\ndefendants\u2019 petition for interlocutory review\nof the district court\u2019s class certification\ndecision and subsequently denied defendants\u2019\npetition for rehearing. On September 27, 2018,\nplaintiffs advised the district court that\nthey would not seek to certify a class for\ninjunctive and declaratory relief. On March\n26, 2020, the Magistrate Judge in the district\ncourt granted in part a motion to compel\narbitration as to class members who are\nparties to certain agreements with Group Inc.\nand/or GS&Co. in which they agreed to\narbitrate employment-related disputes. On\nApril 16, 2020, plaintiffs submitted\nobjections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order and\ndefendants submitted conditional objections in\nthe event that the district judge overturned\nany portion of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order.\nOn July 22, 2021, defendants filed a motion to\ndecertify the class. On September 15, 2021,\nthe district court affirmed the decision of\nthe Magistrate Judge to compel arbitration. On\nMarch 17, 2022, the district court denied the\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary\njudgment as to a portion of the disparate\nimpact claim, granted in part and denied in\npart the defendants\u2019 motion for summary\njudgment as to plaintiffs\u2019 disparate impact\nand treatment claims, denied the defendants\u2019\nmotion to decertify the class, and granted in\npart and denied in part the parties\u2019\nrespective motions to preclude certain expert\ntestimony. On August 22, 2022, the district\ncourt granted in part and denied in part the\ndefendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration of the\nportion of its March 17, 2022 decision that\ndenied the defendants\u2019 motion to decertify the\nclass, denying the defendants\u2019 motion to\ndecertify the class but narrowing the class\ndefinition. Communications Recordkeeping\nInvestigation and Review On September 27,\n2022, the firm entered into settlements with\nthe SEC and CFTC to resolve investigations of\nthe firm\u2019s compliance with records\npreservation requirements relating to business\ncommunications sent over electronic messaging\nchannels that have not been approved by the\nfirm. Under the terms of the settlements, the\nfirm paid $ 125million to the SEC and $\n75million to the CFTC and has agreed to cease\nand desist from further violations of certain\nrecords preservation requirements, to retain a\ncompliance consultant and to implement\nimprovements to its related compliance\npolicies and procedures.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form      100  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The use of\nfair value to measure\nfinancial instruments\nis fundamental to our\nrisk management\npractices and is our\nmost critical\naccounting policy.\n\nThe fair value of a\nfinancial instrument\nis the amount that\nwould be received to\nsell an asset or paid\nto transfer a\nliability in an\norderly transaction\nbetween market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date. We\nmeasure certain\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based\non its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit\nrisks). In determining\nfair value, the\nhierarchy under U.S.\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles\n(U.S. GAAP) gives (i)\nthe highest priority\nto unadjusted quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets for identical,\nunrestricted assets or\nliabilities (level 1\ninputs), (ii) the next\npriority to inputs\nother than level 1\ninputs that are\nobservable, either\ndirectly or indirectly\n(level 2 inputs), and\n(iii) the lowest\npriority to inputs\nthat cannot be\nobserved in market\nactivity (level 3\ninputs). In evaluating\nthe significance of a\nvaluation input, we\nconsider, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s\nnet risk exposure to\nthat input. Assets and\nliabilities are\nclassified in their\nentirety based on the\nlowest level of input\nthat is significant to\ntheir fair value\nmeasurement.\n\nThe fair values for\nsubstantially all of\nour financial assets\nand liabilities are\nbased on observable\nprices and inputs and\nare classified in\nlevels 1 and 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\nCertain level 2 and\nlevel 3 financial\nassets and liabilities\nmay require\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments that a\nmarket participant\nwould require to\narrive at fair value\nfor factors, such as\ncounterparty and our\ncredit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer\nrestrictions,\nliquidity and\nbid/offer spreads.\n\nInstruments classified\nin level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy are\nthose which require\none or more\nsignificant inputs\nthat are not\nobservable. Level 3\nfinancial assets\nrepresented 1.9% as of\nSeptember 2022, 1.8%\nas of June 2022 and\n1.6% as of December\n2021 of our total\nassets.

Absent\nevidence to the\ncontrary, instruments\nclassified in level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy are\ninitially valued at\ntransaction price,\nwhich is considered to\nbe the best initial\nestimate of fair\nvalue. Subsequent to\nthe transaction date,\nwe use other\nmethodologies to\ndetermine fair value,\nwhich vary based on\nthe type of\ninstrument. Estimating\nthe fair value of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstruments requires\njudgments to be made.\nThese judgments\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Determining the\nappropriate valuation\nmethodology and/or\nmodel for each type of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstrument;\n\n\u2022 Determining model\ninputs based on an\nevaluation of all\nrelevant empirical\nmarket data, including\nprices evidenced by\nmarket transactions,\ninterest rates, credit\nspreads, volatilities\nand correlations; and\n\n\u2022 Determining\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments, including\nthose related to\nilliquidity or\ncounterparty credit\nquality.\n\nRegardless of the\nmethodology, valuation\ninputs and assumptions\nare only changed when\ncorroborated by\nsubstantive evidence.\n\nControls Over\nValuation of Financial\nInstruments.

To\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, we classify\nour loans accounted\nfor at amortized cost\ninto wholesale and\nconsumer portfolios.\nThese portfolios\nrepresent the level at\nwhich we have\ndeveloped and\ndocumented our\nmethodology to\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. The allowance\nfor credit losses is\nmeasured on a\ncollective basis for\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics using\na modeled approach and\non an asset-specific\nbasis for loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics.\n\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses takes\ninto account the\nweighted average of a\nrange of forecasts of\nfuture economic\nconditions over the\nexpected life of the\nloans and lending\ncommitments. The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. We\napply judgment in\nweighting individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including our\ninternally derived\neconomic outlook,\nmarket consensus,\nrecent macroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios. Risk\nfactors for wholesale\nloans include internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators (e.g.,\nunemployment rates and\nGDP), the borrower\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its\nfinancial obligations,\nthe borrower\u2019s country\nof risk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. In\naddition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nloan-to-value ratio,\ndebt service ratio and\nhome price index. Risk\nfactors for\ninstallment and credit\ncard loans include\nFair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form      108  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Personnel\nwithin our independent\nrisk oversight and\ncontrol functions are\nresponsible for\nforecasting the\neconomic variables\nthat underlie the\neconomic scenarios\nthat are used in the\nmodeling of expected\ncredit losses. While\nwe use the best\ninformation available\nto determine this\nestimate, future\nadjustments to the\nallowance may be\nnecessary based on,\namong other things,\nchanges in the\neconomic environment\nor variances between\nactual results and the\noriginal assumptions\nused. Loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\n\nWe also record an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on lending\ncommitments which are\nheld for investment\nthat are accounted for\nat amortized cost.\nSuch allowance is\ndetermined using the\nsame methodology as\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses, while also\ntaking into\nconsideration the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding,\nand whether such\ncommitments are\ncancellable by us.\n\nTo estimate the\npotential impact of an\nadverse macroeconomic\nenvironment on our\nallowance for credit\nlosses, we, among\nother things, compared\nthe expected credit\nlosses under the\nweighted average\nforecast used in the\ncalculation of\nallowance for credit\nlosses as of September\n2022 (which was\nweighted towards the\nbaseline and adverse\neconomic scenarios) to\nthe expected credit\nlosses under a 100%\nweighted adverse\neconomic scenario. The\nadverse economic\nscenario of the\nforecast model\nreflects a global\nrecession in the\nfourth quarter of 2022\nthrough the second\nhalf of 2023 resulting\nin an economic\ncontraction, decline\nin consumer spending\nand rising\nunemployment rates. A\n100% weighting to the\nadverse economic\nscenario would have\nresulted in an\napproximate $1.0\nbillion increase in\nour allowance for\ncredit losses as of\nSeptember 2022. This\nhypothetical increase\ndoes not take into\nconsideration any\npotential adjustments\nto qualitative\nreserves. The\nforecasts of\nmacroeconomic\nconditions are\ninherently uncertain\nand do not take into\naccount any other\noffsetting or\ncorrelated effects.\nThe actual credit loss\nin an adverse\nmacroeconomic\nenvironment may differ\nsignificantly from\nthis estimate. See\nNote 9 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about the\nallowance for credit\nlosses.\n                                              \n  Use of Estimates                            \n                                              \nU.S. GAAP requires us\nto make certain\nestimates and\nassumptions. In\naddition to the\nestimates we make in\nconnection with fair\nvalue measurements and\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses on loans\nand lending\ncommitments held for\ninvestment and\naccounted for at\namortized cost, the\nuse of estimates and\nassumptions is also\nimportant in\ndetermining\ndiscretionary\ncompensation accruals,\nthe accounting for\ngoodwill and\nidentifiable\nintangible assets,\nprovisions for losses\nthat may arise from\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\n(including\ngovernmental\ninvestigations), and\naccounting for income\ntaxes.\n\nA substantial portion\nof our compensation\nand benefits\nrepresents\ndiscretionary\ncompensation, which is\nfinalized at year-end.\nWe believe the most\nappropriate way to\nallocate estimated\nyear-end discretionary\ncompensation among\ninterim periods is in\nproportion to the net\nrevenues net of\nprovision for credit\nlosses earned in such\nperiods. In addition\nto the level of net\nrevenues net of\nprovision for credit\nlosses, our overall\ncompensation expense\nin any given year is\nalso influenced by,\namong other factors,\noverall financial\nperformance,\nprevailing labor\nmarkets, business mix,\nthe structure of our\nshare-based\ncompensation programs\nand the external\nenvironment.\n\nGoodwill is assessed\nfor impairment\nannually in the fourth\nquarter or more\nfrequently if events\noccur or circumstances\nchange that indicate\nan impairment may\nexist. When assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its estimated\ncarrying value. If the\nresults of the\nqualitative assessment\nare not conclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment. Estimating\nthe fair value of our\nreporting units\nrequires judgment.\nCritical inputs to the\nfair value estimates\ninclude projected\nearnings and allocated\nequity. There is\ninherent uncertainty\nin the projected\nearnings. The\nestimated carrying\nvalue of each\nreporting unit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nSee Note 12 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\ngoodwill.

The\nincrease in operating\nexpenses compared with\nthe third quarter of\n2021 included higher\ncompensation and\nbenefits expenses\n(reflecting a smaller\nreduction in the year-\nto-date ratio of\ncompensation and\nbenefits to net\nrevenues, net of\nprovision for credit\nlosses, compared with\nthe prior year\nperiod), the inclusion\nof NNIP and GreenSky,\nInc.

As of\nSeptember 2022,\nheadcount increased\n12% compared with\nDecember 2021,\nprimarily reflecting\ninvestments in growth\ninitiatives and the\nacquisitions of NNIP\nand GreenSky.\n\nProvision for Taxes\nThe effective income\ntax rate for the first\nnine months of 2022\nwas 16.9%, down from\nthe full year income\ntax rate of 20.0% for\n2021, primarily due to\nan increase in the\nimpact of permanent\ntax benefits in the\nfirst nine months of\n2022 compared with the\nfull year of 2021. The\nincrease compared with\n16.3% for the first\nhalf of 2022 was\nprimarily due to a\ndecrease in the impact\nof tax benefits on the\nsettlement of employee\nshare-based awards in\nthe first nine months\nof 2022 compared with\nthe first half of\n2022. The Finance Act\n2022, which decreases\nthe U.K. bank\nsurcharge tax rate by\n5% from April 1, 2023,\nwas enacted in\nFebruary 2022. This\nbank surcharge is\ncurrently applicable\nto certain of our U.K.\nsubsidiaries and\nbranches, including\nGoldman Sachs\nInternational (GSI)\nand Goldman Sachs\nInternational Bank\n(GSIB). During the\nfirst nine months of\n2022, certain U.K.\ndeferred tax assets\nand liabilities were\nremeasured and a net\nreduction in deferred\ntax assets of\napproximately $50\nmillion was\nrecognized. In August\n2022, the Inflation\nReduction Act of 2022\nwas signed into law.\nThe Inflation\nReduction Act of 2022\nincludes income tax\nincentives to\nencourage investments\nin clean energy and a\nnew 15% corporate\nalternative minimum\ntax (CAMT). The CAMT\napplies to\ncorporations with\naverage annual profits\nover $1 billion and is\ncalculated on their\nfinancial statement\nincome, with certain\nadjustments, for years\nbeginning after\nDecember 31, 2022.

completed mergers\nand acquisitions volumes are based on full\ncredit to each of the advisors in a\ntransaction. Equity and equity-related and\ndebt offerings are based on full credit for\nsingle book managers and equal credit for\njoint book managers. Transaction volumes may\nnot be indicative of net revenues in a given\nperiod. In addition, transaction volumes for\nprior periods may vary from amounts previously\nreported due to the subsequent withdrawal or a\nchange in the value of a transaction.\n\n\u2022 Equity and equity-related offerings includes\nRule 144A and public common stock offerings,\nconvertible offerings and rights offerings. \u2022\nDebt offerings includes non-convertible\npreferred stock, mortgage-backed securities,\nasset-backed securities and taxable municipal\ndebt. Includes publicly registered and Rule\n144A issues and excludes leveraged loans.\nOperating Environment. During the third\nquarter of 2022, Investment Banking operated\nin an environment generally characterized by\ncontinued broad macroeconomic and geopolitical\nconcerns. As a result, compared with the\nsecond quarter of 2022, industry-wide\ncompleted mergers and acquisitions\ntransactions declined, industry-wide equity\nunderwriting volumes remained low amid\nvolatile equity markets and a decline in\nprices, and industry-wide debt underwriting\nvolumes declined across leveraged finance and\ninvestment-grade issuances amid rising\ninterest rates. In the future, if market and\neconomic conditions deteriorate further, and\nindustry-wide mergers and acquisitions\ntransactions and underwriting volumes continue\nto decline, or credit spreads related to\nhedges on our relationship lending portfolio\ntighten further, net revenues in Investment\nBanking would likely be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, if economic conditions\ndeteriorate further or if the creditworthiness\nof borrowers deteriorates, provision for\ncredit losses would likely be negatively\nimpacted. Three Months Ended September 2022\nversus September 2021. Net revenues in\nInvestment Banking were $1.58 billion for the\nthird quarter of 2022, 57% lower than a strong\nthird quarter of 2021, reflecting\nsignificantly lower net revenues in\nUnderwriting, Financial advisory and Corporate\nlending. The decrease in Underwriting net\nrevenues was due to significantly lower net\nrevenues in both Equity and Debt underwriting,\nreflecting a significant decline in industry-\nwide volumes. The decrease in Financial\nadvisory net revenues reflected a significant\ndecline in industry-wide completed mergers and\nacquisitions transactions from elevated\nactivity levels in the prior year period. The\ndecrease in Corporate lending net revenues was\nprimarily due to net mark-downs on acquisition\nfinancing activities and net losses on hedges.\nProvision for credit losses was $78 million\nfor the third quarter of 2022, compared with\n$41 million for the third quarter of 2021.\nProvisions in the third quarter of 2022\nreflected the continued impact of broad\nmacroeconomic concerns.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form      116  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

However, the\ntime frame for\ncompletion and\ncorresponding revenue\nrecognition of\ntransactions in our\nbacklog varies based\non the nature of the\nassignment, as certain\ntransactions may\nremain in our backlog\nfor longer periods of\ntime.

Net\nrevenues in Investment\nBanking were $6.12\nbillion for the first\nnine months of 2022,\n45% lower than the\nfirst nine months of\n2021, primarily\nreflecting\nsignificantly lower\nnet revenues in\nUnderwriting and lower\nnet revenues in\nFinancial advisory.\n\nThe decrease in\nUnderwriting net\nrevenues was due to\nsignificantly lower\nnet revenues in both\nEquity and Debt\nunderwriting,\nreflecting a\nsignificant decline in\nindustry-wide volumes.\nThe decrease in\nFinancial advisory\nreflected a decline in\nindustry-wide\ncompleted mergers and\nacquisitions\ntransactions.\nCorporate lending net\nrevenues were\nsignificantly higher,\nprimarily due to net\ngains from hedges\nrelated to\nrelationship lending\nactivities compared\nwith net losses in the\nprior year period and\nhigher net revenues\nfrom transaction\nbanking, partially\noffset by net mark-\ndowns on acquisition\nfinancing activities.\n\nProvision for credit\nlosses was $325\nmillion for the first\nnine months of 2022,\ncompared with a net\nbenefit of $229\nmillion for the first\nnine months of 2021.\nProvisions for the\nfirst nine months of\n2022 primarily\nreflected the impact\nof broad macroeconomic\nand geopolitical\nconcerns, while the\nnet benefit in the\nfirst nine months of\n2021 reflected reserve\nreductions as the\nbroad economic\nenvironment continued\nto improve following\nthe initial impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOperating expenses\nwere $3.39 billion for\nthe first nine months\nof 2022, 34% lower\nthan the first nine\nmonths of 2021,\nprimarily reflecting\nsignificantly lower\ncompensation and\nbenefits expenses.\nPre-tax earnings were\n$2.41 billion for the\nfirst nine months of\n2022, 61% lower than\nthe first nine months\nof 2021.\n\nAs of September 2022,\nour investment banking\ntransaction backlog\ndecreased compared\nwith December 2021,\ndue to significantly\nlower estimated net\nrevenues from\npotential debt\nunderwriting\ntransactions\n(primarily from\nleveraged finance\ntransactions).\n                                              \n  Global Markets                              \n                                              \nOur Global Markets\nsegment consists of:\n\nFICC.

In\naddition, we maintain\n(i) market-making\npositions, typically\nfor a short period of\ntime, in response to,\nor in anticipation of,\nclient demand, and\n(ii) positions to\nactively manage our\nrisk exposures that\narise from these\nmarket-making\nactivities\n(collectively,\ninventory). Our\ninventory is recorded\nin trading assets\n(long positions) or\ntrading liabilities\n(short positions) in\nour consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nOur results are\ninfluenced by a\ncombination of\ninterconnected\ndrivers, including (i)\nclient activity levels\nand transactional\nbid/offer spreads\n(collectively, client\nactivity), and (ii)\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of our inventory\nand interest income\nand interest expense\nrelated to the\nholding, hedging and\nfunding of our\ninventory\n(collectively, market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges). Due to the\nintegrated nature of\nour market-making\nactivities,\ndisaggregation of net\nrevenues into client\nactivity and market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges is judgmental\nand has inherent\ncomplexities and\nlimitations.\n\nThe amount and\ncomposition of our net\nrevenues vary over\ntime as these drivers\nare impacted by\nmultiple interrelated\nfactors affecting\neconomic and market\nconditions, including\nvolatility and\nliquidity in the\nmarket, changes in\ninterest rates,\ncurrency exchange\nrates, credit spreads,\nequity prices and\ncommodity prices,\ninvestor confidence,\nand other\nmacroeconomic concerns\nand uncertainties.\n\nIn general, assuming\nall other market-\nmaking conditions\nremain constant,\nincreases in client\nactivity levels or\nbid/offer spreads tend\nto result in increases\nin net revenues, and\ndecreases tend to have\nthe opposite effect.\nHowever, changes in\nmarket-making\nconditions can\nmaterially impact\nclient activity levels\nand bid/offer spreads,\nas well as the fair\nvalue of our\ninventory. For\nexample, a decrease in\nliquidity in the\nmarket could have the\nimpact of (i)\nincreasing our\nbid/offer spread, (ii)\ndecreasing investor\nconfidence and thereby\ndecreasing client\nactivity levels, and\n(iii) widening of\ncredit spreads on our\ninventory positions.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form      118  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During the third\nquarter of 2022, Asset Management operated in\nan environment generally characterized by\ncontinued broad macroeconomic and geopolitical\nconcerns and market volatility, which\ncontributed to a further decrease in global\nequity prices compared to the second quarter\nof 2022. Additionally, global central banks\ncontinued to react to inflationary pressures\nby generally increasing policy interest rates.\nIn the future, if market and economic\nconditions deteriorate further, it may lead to\na continued decline in asset prices or\nwidening of credit spreads, or investors\ntransitioning to asset classes that typically\ngenerate lower fees or withdrawing their\nassets, and net revenues in Asset Management\nwould likely continue to be negatively\nimpacted. Three Months Ended September 2022\nversus September 2021. Net revenues in Asset\nManagement were $1.82 billion for the third\nquarter of 2022, 20% lower than the third\nquarter of 2021, primarily reflecting\nsignificantly lower net revenues in Equity\ninvestments and Lending and debt investments,\npartially offset by significantly higher net\nrevenues in Management and other fees. The\ndecrease in Equity investments net revenues\nreflected significantly lower net gains from\ninvestments in private equities, partially\noffset by mark-to-market net gains from\ninvestments in public equities compared with\nsignificant net losses in the third quarter of\n2021. The decrease in Lending and debt\ninvestments net revenues primarily reflected\nnet mark-downs compared with net mark-ups in\nthe prior year period. Incentive fees were\nlower, driven by harvesting in the prior year\nperiod. The increase in Management and other\nfees reflected the inclusion of NNIP in the\ncurrent period and the impact of fee waivers\non money market funds in the prior year\nperiod.\n\nProvision for credit losses was $29 million\nfor the third quarter of 2022, compared with\n$10 million for the third quarter of 2021.\nOperating expenses were $1.57 billion for the\nthird quarter of 2022, 90% higher than the\nthird quarter of 2021, reflecting\nsignificantly higher compensation and benefits\nexpenses and the inclusion of operating\nexpenses related to NNIP following its\nacquisition in April 2022. Pre-tax earnings\nwere $227 million for the third quarter of\n2022, 84% lower than the third quarter of\n2021. Nine Months Ended September 2022 versus\nSeptember 2021. Net revenues in Asset\nManagement were $3.45 billion for the first\nnine months of 2022, 71% lower than the first\nnine months of 2021, reflecting significantly\nlower net revenues in Equity investments and\nLending and debt investments, partially offset\nby significantly higher Management and other\nfees. The decrease in Equity investments net\nrevenues reflected significantly lower net\ngains from investments in private equities and\nsignificant mark-to-market net losses from\ninvestments in public equities. The decrease\nin Lending and debt investments net revenues\nprimarily reflected net mark-downs compared\nwith net mark-ups in the prior year period.\nThe increase in Management and other fees\nreflected the inclusion of NNIP and the impact\nof fee waivers on money market funds in the\nprior year period. Incentive fees were higher.\nProvision for credit losses was $129 million\nfor the first nine months of 2022, compared\nwith net benefit of $2 million for the first\nnine months of 2021. Provisions for the first\nnine months of 2022 primarily reflected the\nimpact of macroeconomic and geopolitical\nconcerns, while the net benefit in the first\nnine months of 2021 included reserve\nreductions as the broad economic environment\ncontinued to improve following the initial\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating\nexpenses were $4.12 billion for the first nine\nmonths of 2022, 11% lower than the first nine\nmonths of 2021, reflecting significantly lower\ncompensation and benefits expenses, partially\noffset by the inclusion of operating expenses\nrelated to NNIP following its acquisition in\nApril 2022. Pre-tax loss was $799 million for\nthe first nine months of 2022, compared to\npre-tax earnings of $7.37 billion for the\nfirst nine months of 2021.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form      122  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During the third\nquarter of 2022, Consumer & Wealth Management\ncontinued to operate in an environment\ngenerally characterized by broad macroeconomic\nand geopolitical concerns and market\nvolatility, which contributed to a decrease in\nasset prices compared with the end of the\nsecond quarter of 2022. For consumer banking\nactivities, in the U.S., the rate of\nunemployment remained low and consumer\nspending increased slightly compared with the\nsecond quarter of 2022. Additionally, global\ncentral banks continued to react to\ninflationary pressures by generally increasing\npolicy interest rates. In the future, if\nmarket and economic conditions deteriorate\nfurther, it may lead to a continued decline in\nasset prices, or investors transitioning to\nasset classes that typically generate lower\nfees or withdrawing their assets, or consumers\nwithdrawing their deposits or a deterioration\nin consumer credit, and net revenues and\nprovision for credit losses in Consumer &\nWealth Management would likely be negatively\nimpacted. Three Months Ended September 2022\nversus September 2021. Net revenues in\nConsumer & Wealth Management were $2.38\nbillion for the third quarter of 2022, 18%\nhigher than the third quarter of 2021. Net\nrevenues in Wealth management were $1.63\nbillion, essentially unchanged compared with\nthe third quarter of 2021, reflecting\nsignificantly lower Incentive fees, driven by\nharvesting in the prior year period, offset by\nsignificantly higher net revenues in Private\nbanking and lending, due to the impact of\nhigher loan and deposit balances. Management\nand other fees were essentially unchanged.\n\nNet revenues in Consumer banking were $744\nmillion, nearly double the amount in the third\nquarter of 2021, primarily reflecting\nsignificantly higher credit card balances and\nhigher deposit spreads. Provision for credit\nlosses was $451 million for the third quarter\nof 2022, compared with $148 million for the\nthird quarter of 2021. Provisions in the third\nquarter of 2022 reflected consumer portfolio\ngrowth (primarily in credit cards) and net\ncharge-offs, while the third quarter of 2021\nprimarily reflected growth in credit cards.\nOperating expenses were $1.89 billion for the\nthird quarter of 2022, 16% higher than the\nthird quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting\nhigher spend on growth initiatives in Consumer\nbanking, including the operating expenses\nrelated to GreenSky following its acquisition\nin March 2022. Pre-tax earnings were $38\nmillion for the third quarter of 2022, 84%\nlower than the third quarter of 2021. Nine\nMonths Ended September 2022 versus September\n2021. Net revenues in Consumer & Wealth\nManagement were $6.66 billion for the first\nnine months of 2022, 21% higher than the first\nnine months of 2021. Net revenues in Wealth\nmanagement were $4.82 billion, 10% higher than\nthe first nine months of 2021, due to higher\nManagement and other fees, primarily\nreflecting the impact of higher average assets\nunder supervision, and significantly higher\nnet revenues in Private banking and lending,\nreflecting higher loan and deposit balances.\nThese increases were partially offset by lower\nIncentive fees, driven by harvesting in the\nprior year period. Net revenues in Consumer\nbanking were $1.84 billion, 64% higher than\nthe first nine months of 2021, primarily\nreflecting significantly higher credit card\nbalances and higher deposit spreads. Provision\nfor credit losses was $1.10 billion for the\nfirst nine months of 2022, compared with $274\nmillion for the first nine months of 2021.\nProvisions for the first nine months of 2022\nprimarily reflected consumer portfolio growth\n(primarily in credit cards) and net charge-\noffs, while the first nine months of 2021\nincluded reserve reductions as the broad\neconomic environment continued to improve\nfollowing the initial impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. Operating expenses were $5.22\nbillion for the first nine months of 2022, 16%\nhigher than the first nine months of 2021,\nprimarily reflecting higher spend on growth\ninitiatives in Consumer banking, including the\noperating expenses related to GreenSky\nfollowing its acquisition in March 2022. Pre-\ntax earnings were $337 million for the first\nnine months of 2022, 54% lower than the first\nnine months of 2021.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form      124  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

While\nour asset base changes due to client activity,\nmarket fluctuations and business\nopportunities, the size and composition of our\nbalance sheet also reflects factors, including\n(i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the\namount of capital we hold and (iii) our\nfunding profile, among other factors. See\n\u201cCapital Management and Regulatory Capital \u2014\nCapital Management\u201d for information about our\ncapital management process. Although our\nbalance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day\nbasis, our total assets at quarter-end and\nyear-end dates are generally not materially\ndifferent from those occurring within our\nreporting periods. In order to ensure\nappropriate risk management, we seek to\nmaintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet\nand have processes in place to dynamically\nmanage our assets and liabilities, which\ninclude (i) balance sheet planning, (ii)\nbalance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key\nmetrics and (iv) scenario analyses. Balance\nSheet Planning. We prepare a balance sheet\nplan that combines our projected total assets\nand composition of assets with our expected\nfunding sources over a three-year time\nhorizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and\nmay be adjusted in response to changing\nbusiness needs or market conditions. The\nobjectives of this planning process are: \u2022 To\ndevelop our balance sheet projections, taking\ninto account the general state of the\nfinancial markets and expected business\nactivity levels, as well as regulatory\nrequirements; \u2022 To allow Treasury and our\nindependent risk oversight and control\nfunctions to objectively evaluate balance\nsheet limit requests from our revenue-\nproducing units in the context of our overall\nbalance sheet constraints, including our\nliability profile and capital levels, and key\nmetrics; and \u2022 To inform the target amount,\ntenor and type of funding to raise, based on\nour projected assets and contractual\nmaturities. Treasury and our independent risk\noversight and control functions, along with\nour revenue-producing units, review current\nand prior period information and expectations\nfor the year to prepare our balance sheet\nplan. The specific information reviewed\nincludes asset and liability size and\ncomposition, limit utilization, risk and\nperformance measures, and capital usage.\n                                              \n  129    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form    \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Requests for\nchanges in limits are\nevaluated after giving\nconsideration to their\nimpact on our key\nmetrics. Compliance\nwith limits is\nmonitored by our\nrevenue-producing\nunits and Treasury, as\nwell as our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions.\n\nMonitoring of Key\nMetrics. We monitor\nkey balance sheet\nmetrics both by\nbusiness and on a\nconsolidated basis,\nincluding asset and\nliability size and\ncomposition, limit\nutilization and risk\nmeasures. We attribute\nassets to businesses\nand review and analyze\nmovements resulting\nfrom new business\nactivity, as well as\nmarket fluctuations.\n\nScenario Analyses. We\nconduct various\nscenario analyses,\nincluding as part of\nthe CCAR and U.S.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act Stress\nTests (DFAST), as well\nas our resolution and\nrecovery planning. See\n\u201cCapital Management\nand Regulatory Capital\n\u2014 Capital Management\u201d\nfor further\ninformation about\nthese scenario\nanalyses.

We\nfund a significant\namount of inventory\nand a portion of\ninvestments on a\nsecured basis. Secured\nfunding includes\ncollateralized\nfinancings in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets. See Note 11 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about our\ncollateralized\nfinancings, including\nits maturity profile.\nWe may also pledge our\ninventory and\ninvestments as\ncollateral for\nsecurities borrowed\nunder a securities\nlending agreement. We\nalso use our own\ninventory and\ninvestments to cover\ntransactions in which\nwe or our clients have\nsold securities that\nhave not yet been\npurchased. Secured\nfunding is less\nsensitive to changes\nin our credit quality\nthan unsecured\nfunding, due to our\nposting of collateral\nto our lenders.\nNonetheless, we\nanalyze the\nrefinancing risk of\nour secured funding\nactivities, taking\ninto account trade\ntenors, maturity\nprofiles, counterparty\nconcentrations,\ncollateral eligibility\nand counterparty\nrollover\nprobabilities. We seek\nto mitigate our\nrefinancing risk by\nexecuting term trades\nwith staggered\nmaturities,\ndiversifying\ncounterparties,\nraising excess secured\nfunding and pre-\nfunding residual risk\nthrough our GCLA. We\nseek to raise secured\nfunding with a term\nappropriate for the\nliquidity of the\nassets that are being\nfinanced, and we seek\nlonger maturities for\nsecured funding\ncollateralized by\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis,\nespecially during\ntimes of market\nstress. Our secured\nfunding, excluding\nfunding collateralized\nby liquid government\nand agency\nobligations, is\nprimarily executed for\ntenors of one month or\ngreater and is\nprimarily executed\nthrough term\nrepurchase agreements\nand securities loaned\ncontracts. Assets that\nmay be harder to fund\non a secured basis\nduring times of market\nstress include certain\nfinancial instruments\nin the following\ncategories: mortgage-\nand other asset-backed\nloans and securities,\nnon-investment-grade\ncorporate debt\nsecurities, equity\nsecurities and\nemerging market\nsecurities. We also\nraise financing\nthrough other types of\ncollateralized\nfinancings, such as\nsecured loans and\nnotes. GS Bank USA has\naccess to funding from\nthe Federal Home Loan\nBank. Our outstanding\nborrowings against the\nFederal Home Loan Bank\nwere $1.50 billion as\nof September 2022 and\n$100 million as of\nDecember 2021.\nAdditionally, we have\naccess to funding\nthrough the Federal\nReserve discount\nwindow. However, we do\nnot rely on this\nfunding in our\nliquidity planning and\nstress testing.\n\nUnsecured Short-Term\nBorrowings. A\nsignificant portion of\nour unsecured short-\nterm borrowings was\noriginally long-term\ndebt that is scheduled\nto mature within one\nyear of the reporting\ndate. We use unsecured\nshort-term borrowings,\nincluding U.S. and\nnon-U.S. hybrid\nfinancial instruments\nand commercial paper,\nto finance liquid\nassets and for other\ncash management\npurposes.

See Notes 14\nand 19 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\npreferred stock and\nother subordinated\ndebt.\n\nCapital Planning and\nStress Testing\nProcess. As part of\ncapital planning, we\nproject sources and\nuses of capital given\na range of business\nenvironments,\nincluding stressed\nconditions. Our stress\ntesting process is\ndesigned to identify\nand measure material\nrisks associated with\nour business\nactivities, including\nmarket risk, credit\nrisk, operational risk\nand liquidity risk, as\nwell as our ability to\ngenerate revenues.\n\nOur capital planning\nprocess incorporates\nan internal capital\nadequacy assessment\nwith the objective of\nensuring that we are\nappropriately\ncapitalized relative\nto the risks in our\nbusinesses. We\nincorporate stress\nscenarios into our\ncapital planning\nprocess with a goal of\nholding sufficient\ncapital to ensure we\nremain adequately\ncapitalized after\nexperiencing a severe\nstress event. Our\nassessment of capital\nadequacy is viewed in\ntandem with our\nassessment of\nliquidity adequacy and\nis integrated into our\noverall risk\nmanagement structure,\ngovernance and policy\nframework.\n\nOur stress tests\nincorporate our\ninternally designed\nstress scenarios,\nincluding our\ninternally developed\nseverely adverse\nscenario, and those\nrequired by the FRB,\nand are designed to\ncapture our specific\nvulnerabilities and\nrisks. We provide\nfurther information\nabout our stress test\nprocesses and a\nsummary of the results\non our website as\ndescribed in\n\u201cAvailable\nInformation.\u201d\n\nAs required by the\nFRB\u2019s CCAR rules, we\nsubmit an annual\ncapital plan for\nreview by the FRB. The\npurpose of the FRB\u2019s\nreview is to ensure\nthat we have a robust,\nforward-looking\ncapital planning\nprocess that accounts\nfor our unique risks\nand that permits\ncontinued operation\nduring times of\neconomic and financial\nstress.\n\nThe FRB evaluates us\nbased, in part, on\nwhether we have the\ncapital necessary to\ncontinue operating\nunder the baseline and\nseverely adverse\nscenarios provided by\nthe FRB and those\ndeveloped internally.\nThis evaluation also\ntakes into account our\nprocess for\nidentifying risk, our\ncontrols and\ngovernance for capital\nplanning, and our\nguidelines for making\ncapital planning\ndecisions. In\naddition, the FRB\nevaluates our plan to\nmake capital\ndistributions (i.e.,\ndividend payments and\nrepurchases or\nredemptions of stock,\nsubordinated debt or\nother capital\nsecurities) and issue\ncapital, across the\nrange of macroeconomic\nscenarios and firm-\nspecific assumptions.\nThe FRB determines the\nstress capital buffer\n(SCB) applicable to us\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\nThe SCB under the\nStandardized approach\nis calculated as (i)\nthe difference between\nour starting and\nminimum projected CET1\ncapital ratios under\nthe supervisory\nseverely adverse\nscenario and (ii) our\nplanned common stock\ndividends for each of\nthe fourth through\nseventh quarters of\nthe planning horizon,\nexpressed as a\npercentage of risk-\nweighted assets\n(RWAs).\n\nBased on our 2022 CCAR\nsubmission, the FRB\nreduced our SCB from\n6.4% to 6.3% for the\nperiod from October 1,\n2022 through September\n30, 2023. As a result,\nbeginning on October\n1, 2022, our\nStandardized CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement is 13.3%.\nAdditionally,\neffective January 1,\n2023, our global\nsystemically important\nbank (G-SIB) surcharge\nwill increase from\n2.5% to 3.0%,\nresulting in a\nStandardized CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement of 13.8%.\nSee \u201cShare Repurchase\nProgram\u201d for further\ninformation about\ncommon stock\nrepurchases and\ndividends and\n\u201cConsolidated\nRegulatory Capital\u201d\nfor further\ninformation about the\nG-SIB surcharge.

As part of our\ncomprehensive capital\nmanagement policy, we\nmaintain a contingency\ncapital plan. Our\ncontingency capital\nplan provides a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nperceived or actual\ncapital deficiency,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to,\nidentification of\ndrivers of a capital\ndeficiency, as well as\nmitigants and\npotential actions. It\noutlines the\nappropriate\ncommunication\nprocedures to follow\nduring a crisis\nperiod, including\ninternal dissemination\nof information, as\nwell as timely\ncommunication with\nexternal stakeholders.\n\nCapital Attribution.\nWe assess each of our\nbusinesses\u2019 capital\nusage based on our\ninternal assessment of\nrisks, which\nincorporates an\nattribution of our\nrelevant regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nThese regulatory\ncapital requirements\nare allocated using\nour attributed equity\nframework, which takes\ninto consideration our\nmost binding capital\nconstraints. Our most\nbinding capital\nconstraint is based on\nthe results of the\nFRB\u2019s annual stress\ntest, which includes\nthe Standardized risk-\nbased capital and\nleverage ratios.\n\nWe review and make any\nnecessary adjustments\nto our attributed\nequity framework in\nJanuary each year, to\nreflect, among other\nthings, the results of\nour latest CCAR\nprocess, as well as\nprojected changes in\nour balance sheet. On\nJanuary 1, 2022, our\nallocation of\nattributed equity\nchanged (relative to\nthe allocation as of\nDecember 2021) as\nfollows: attributed\nequity increased by\napproximately $1.0\nbillion for Consumer &\nWealth Management and\napproximately $0.5\nbillion for Investment\nBanking, while\nattributed equity\ndecreased by\napproximately $0.8\nbillion for Global\nMarkets and\napproximately $0.7\nbillion for Asset\nManagement. See\n\u201cSegment Assets and\nOperating Results \u2014\nSegment Operating\nResults\u201d for\ninformation about our\naverage quarterly\nattributed equity by\nsegment.\n\nShare Repurchase\nProgram. We use our\nshare repurchase\nprogram to help\nmaintain the\nappropriate level of\ncommon equity. The\nrepurchase program is\neffected primarily\nthrough regular open-\nmarket purchases\n(which may include\nrepurchase plans\ndesigned to comply\nwith Rule 10b5-1 and\naccelerated share\nrepurchases), the\namounts and timing of\nwhich are determined\nprimarily by our\ncurrent and projected\ncapital position and\nour capital plan\nsubmitted to the FRB\nas part of CCAR. The\namounts and timing of\nthe repurchases may\nalso be influenced by\ngeneral market\nconditions and the\nprevailing price and\ntrading volumes of our\ncommon stock.\n\nIn the third quarter\nof 2022, the Board of\nDirectors of Group\nInc. (Board) approved\nan increase in our\ncommon stock dividend\nfrom $2.00 to $2.50\nper share. During the\nthird quarter of 2022,\nwe returned a total of\n$1.89 billion to\nshareholders,\nincluding common stock\nrepurchases of $1.00\nbillion and common\nstock dividends of\n$893 million.\nConsistent with our\ncapital management\nphilosophy, we will\ncontinue prioritizing\ndeployment of capital\nfor our clients where\nreturns are attractive\nand return any excess\ncapital to\nshareholders through\ndividends and share\nrepurchases.\n\nAs of September 2022,\nthe remaining share\nauthorization under\nour existing\nrepurchase program was\n28.5 million shares.\nSee \u201cUnregistered\nSales of Equity\nSecurities and Use of\nProceeds\u201d in Part II,\nItem 2 of this Form\n10-Q and Note 19 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about our\nshare repurchase\nprogram, and see above\nfor information about\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess.\n\nIn August 2022, the\nInflation Reduction\nAct of 2022 introduced\na one percent non-\ndeductible excise tax\non the fair market\nvalue of certain\ncorporate share\nrepurchases after\nDecember 31, 2022. The\nfair market value of\nshare repurchases\nsubject to the tax is\nreduced by the fair\nmarket value of any\nstock issued by the\ncorporation during the\ncalendar year,\nincluding stock issued\nto employees. We are\nanalyzing the impact\nof the excise tax on\nour financial\ncondition, results of\noperations and cash\nflows.\n\nResolution Capital\nModels.

In\naddition, credit\nrating agencies have\nassigned ratings to\ndebt obligations of\ncertain other\nsubsidiaries of Group\nInc. The level and\ncomposition of our\ncapital are among the\nmany factors\nconsidered in\ndetermining our credit\nratings.

Our\nG-SIB surcharge is\n2.5% for 2022 and 3.0%\nfor 2023. Based on\nfinancial data for\n2021 and the nine\nmonths ended September\n2022, we are above the\nthreshold for the 3.5%\nG-SIB surcharge. Based\non the recent\noperating environment\nand our clients\u2019\nneeds, we are\ncurrently targeting to\nbe at the 3.0% G-SIB\nlevel as of December\n2022 (which would be\neffective for our\nJanuary 2024 G-SIB\nsurcharge). Our\nability to achieve the\n3.0% G-SIB level will\ndepend on the market\nenvironment and needs\nof our clients in the\nfourth quarter of\n2022. We will continue\nto evaluate this\ntarget through the end\nof 2022. The G-SIB\nsurcharge and\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer in the\nfuture may differ due\nto additional guidance\nfrom our regulators\nand/or positional\nchanges, and our SCB\nis likely to change\nfrom year to year\nbased on the results\nof the annual\nsupervisory stress\ntests. Our target is\nto maintain capital\nratios equal to the\nregulatory\nrequirements plus a\nbuffer of 50 to 100\nbasis points.\n\nSee Note 20 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\nrisk-based capital\nratios and leverage\nratios, and the\nCapital Framework.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity (TLAC) We are\nalso subject to the\nFRB\u2019s TLAC and related\nrequirements.

Rule\n15c3-1 of the SEC and\nRules 1.17 and Part 23\nSubpart E of the CFTC\nspecify uniform\nminimum net capital\nrequirements, as\ndefined, for their\nregistrants, and also\neffectively require\nthat a significant\npart of the\nregistrants\u2019 assets be\nkept in relatively\nliquid form. GS&Co.\nhas elected to\ncalculate its minimum\ncapital requirements\nin accordance with the\n\u201cAlternative Net\nCapital Requirement\u201d\nas permitted by Rule\n15c3-1 of the SEC.\n\nGS&Co. had regulatory\nnet capital, as\ndefined by Rule\n15c3-1, of $21.44\nbillion as of\nSeptember 2022 and\n$22.18 billion as of\nDecember 2021, which\nexceeded the amount\nrequired by $16.61\nbillion as of\nSeptember 2022 and\n$17.74 billion as of\nDecember 2021. In\naddition to its\nalternative minimum\nnet capital\nrequirements, GS&Co.\nis also required to\nhold tentative net\ncapital in excess of\n$5 billion and net\ncapital in excess of\n$1 billion in\naccordance with Rule\n15c3-1. GS&Co. is also\nrequired to notify the\nSEC in the event that\nits tentative net\ncapital is less than\n$6 billion. As of both\nSeptember 2022 and\nDecember 2021, GS&Co.\nhad tentative net\ncapital and net\ncapital in excess of\nboth the minimum and\nthe notification\nrequirements.

As of both September 2022 and December\n2021, GSI was subject to and in compliance\nwith applicable capital requirements for swap\ndealers and security-based swap dealers. GSI\nis also subject to a minimum requirement for\nown funds and eligible liabilities issued to\naffiliates. This requirement is subject to a\ntransitional period which began to phase in\nfrom January 2019 and became fully effective\nbeginning in January 2022. As of both\nSeptember 2022 and December 2021, GSI was in\ncompliance with this requirement. GSJCL, our\nJapanese broker-dealer, is regulated by\nJapan\u2019s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL and\ncertain other non-U.S. subsidiaries are also\nsubject to capital requirements promulgated by\nauthorities of the countries in which they\noperate. As of both September 2022 and\nDecember 2021, these subsidiaries were in\ncompliance with their local capital\nrequirements.\n\nRegulatory and Other Matters Regulatory\nMatters Our businesses are subject to\nextensive regulation and supervision\nworldwide. Regulations have been adopted or\nare being considered by regulators and policy\nmakers worldwide. Given that many of the new\nand proposed rules are highly complex, the\nfull impact of regulatory reform will not be\nknown until the rules are implemented and\nmarket practices develop under the final\nregulations. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in\nPart I, Item 1 of the 2021 Form 10-K for\nfurther information about the laws, rules and\nregulations and proposed laws, rules and\nregulations that apply to us and our\noperations. Other Matters Replacement of\nInterbank Offered Rates (IBORs), including\nLIBOR. On January 1, 2022, the publication of\nall EUR, CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR (non-USD\nLIBOR) settings along with certain USD LIBOR\nsettings ceased. The publication of the most\ncommonly used USD LIBOR settings will cease\nafter June 2023. The FCA has allowed the\npublication and use of synthetic rates for\ncertain GBP and JPY LIBOR settings in legacy\nGBP or JPY LIBOR-based derivative contracts\nthrough December 2022. The U.S. federal\nbanking agencies\u2019 guidance strongly encourages\nbanking organizations to cease using USD\nLIBOR. The International Swaps and Derivatives\nAssociation (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks\nProtocol (IBOR Protocol) has provided\nderivatives market participants with amended\nfallbacks for legacy and new derivative\ncontracts to mitigate legal or economic\nuncertainty. Both counterparties have to\nadhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in\nbilateral amendments for the terms to be\neffective for derivative contracts. ISDA has\nconfirmed that the FCA\u2019s formal announcement\nto cease both non-USD and USD LIBOR settings\nfixed the spread adjustment for all LIBOR\nrates and as a result fallbacks applied\nautomatically for non-USD LIBOR settings\nfollowing December 31, 2021 and will apply\nautomatically for USD LIBOR settings following\nJune 30, 2023. The Adjustable Interest Rate\n(LIBOR) Act, that was enacted in March 2022,\nprovides a statutory framework to replace USD\nLIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for\ncontracts governed by U.S. law that have no\nfallbacks or fallbacks that would require the\nuse of a poll or LIBOR-based rate. Under the\nLIBOR Act, the FRB must adopt rules to\nidentify the applicable SOFR-based replacement\nrate. In July 2022, the FRB released proposed\nrules, which would identify different SOFR-\nbased replacement rates for derivative\ncontracts, for cash instruments such as\nfloating-rate notes and preferred stock, for\nconsumer contracts and for certain government-\nsponsored enterprise contracts. The FRB has\nnot yet adopted these rules.\n                                              \n  137    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form    \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Our risk\nexposure to USD LIBOR\nis primarily in\nconnection with our\nderivative contracts\nand, to a lesser\nextent, our unsecured\ndebt, preferred stock\nand loan portfolio. As\nof September 2022, the\nnotional amount of our\nUSD LIBOR-based\nderivative contracts\nwas approximately $7\ntrillion, of which\napproximately $5\ntrillion will mature\nafter June 2023 based\non their contractual\nterms. Substantially\nall of such derivative\ncontracts are with\ncounterparties under\nbilateral agreements\nsubject to the IBOR\nProtocol, or with\ncentral clearing\ncounterparties or\nexchanges which have\nincorporated fallbacks\nconsistent with the\nIBOR Protocol in their\nrulebooks and have\nannounced that they\nplan to convert USD\nLIBOR contracts to\nalternative risk-free\nreference rates. Our\nbenchmark unsecured\ndebt and preferred\nstock with USD LIBOR\nexposure was\napproximately $29.0\nbillion as of\nSeptember 2022, of\nwhich $26.4 billion\nwill contractually\nmature after June 2023\nor is perpetual and\nhas no stated maturity\ndate. We continue to\nmonitor industry and\nlegislative\ndevelopments as they\nrelate to unsecured\ndebt and preferred\nstock and will take\nactions designed to\nfacilitate an orderly\ntransition. In\naddition, we are also\nengaging with our\nclients in order to\nremediate our loan\nagreements through\nbilateral amendments.\nWe have also issued\ndebt and deposits\nlinked to SOFR and\nSterling Overnight\nIndex Average (SONIA)\nand executed SOFR- and\nSONIA-based derivative\ncontracts to make\nmarkets and facilitate\nclient activities.\nWhen appropriate, we\ncontinue to execute\ntransactions in the\nmarket to reduce our\nUSD LIBOR exposures\narising from hedges to\nour fixed-rate debt\nissuances and replace\nthem with alternative\nrisk-free reference\nrate exposures.

Our\ninvolvement in these\narrangements can take\nmany different forms,\nincluding: \u2022\nPurchasing or\nretaining residual and\nother interests in\nspecial purpose\nentities, such as\nmortgage-backed and\nother asset-backed\nsecuritization\nvehicles; \u2022 Holding\nsenior and\nsubordinated debt,\ninterests in limited\nand general\npartnerships, and\npreferred and common\nstock in other\nnonconsolidated\nvehicles; \u2022 Entering\ninto interest rate,\nforeign currency,\nequity, commodity and\ncredit derivatives,\nincluding total return\nswaps; and \u2022 Providing\nguarantees,\nindemnifications,\ncommitments, letters\nof credit and\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. We enter\ninto these\narrangements for a\nvariety of business\npurposes, including\nsecuritizations. The\nsecuritization\nvehicles that purchase\nmortgages, corporate\nbonds and other types\nof financial assets\nare critical to the\nfunctioning of several\nsignificant investor\nmarkets, including the\nmortgage-backed and\nother asset-backed\nsecurities markets,\nsince they offer\ninvestors access to\nspecific cash flows\nand risks created\nthrough the\nsecuritization\nprocess. We also enter\ninto these\narrangements to\nunderwrite client\nsecuritization\ntransactions; provide\nsecondary market\nliquidity; make\ninvestments in\nperforming and\nnonperforming debt,\ndistressed loans,\npower-related assets,\nequity securities,\nreal estate and other\nassets; and provide\ninvestors with credit-\nlinked and asset-\nrepackaged notes.

Our risk\nmanagement structure\nis built around three\ncore components:\ngovernance, processes\nand people.\n\nGovernance. Risk\nmanagement governance\nstarts with the Board,\nwhich both directly\nand through its\ncommittees, including\nits Risk Committee,\noversees our risk\nmanagement policies\nand practices\nimplemented through\nthe enterprise risk\nmanagement framework.\nThe Board is also\nresponsible for the\nannual review and\napproval of our risk\nappetite statement.\nThe risk appetite\nstatement describes\nthe levels and types\nof risk we are willing\nto accept or to avoid,\nin order to achieve\nour objectives\nincluded in our\nstrategic business\nplan, while remaining\nin compliance with\nregulatory\nrequirements. The\nBoard reviews our\nstrategic business\nplan and is ultimately\nresponsible for\noverseeing and\nproviding direction\nabout our strategy and\nrisk appetite.\n\nThe Board receives\nregular briefings on\nfirmwide risks,\nincluding liquidity\nrisk, market risk,\ncredit risk,\noperational risk and\nmodel risk, from our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions, including\nthe chief risk\nofficer, and on\ncompliance risk and\nconduct risk from\nCompliance, on legal\nand regulatory\nenforcement matters\nfrom the chief legal\nofficer, and on other\nmatters impacting our\nreputation from the\nchair of our Firmwide\nClient and Business\nStandards Committee\nand our Firmwide\nReputational Risk\nCommittee. The chief\nrisk officer reports\nto our chief executive\nofficer and to the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard. As part of the\nreview of the firmwide\nrisk portfolio, the\nchief risk officer\nregularly advises the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard of relevant risk\nmetrics and material\nexposures, including\nrisk limits and\nthresholds established\nin our risk appetite\nstatement.\n\nThe implementation of\nour risk governance\nstructure and core\nrisk management\nprocesses is overseen\nby Enterprise Risk,\nwhich reports to our\nchief risk officer,\nand is responsible for\nensuring that our\nenterprise risk\nmanagement framework\nprovides the Board,\nour risk committees\nand senior management\nwith a consistent and\nintegrated approach to\nmanaging our various\nrisks in a manner\nconsistent with our\nrisk appetite.\n\nOur revenue-producing\nunits, as well as\nTreasury, Engineering,\nHuman Capital\nManagement,\nOperations, and\nCorporate and\nWorkplace Solutions,\nare considered our\nfirst line of defense.\nThey are accountable\nfor the outcomes of\nour risk-generating\nactivities, as well as\nfor assessing and\nmanaging those risks\nwithin our risk\nappetite.\n\nOur independent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions are\nconsidered our second\nline of defense and\nprovide independent\nassessment, oversight\nand challenge of the\nrisks taken by our\nfirst line of defense,\nas well as lead and\nparticipate in risk\ncommittees.\nIndependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions include\nCompliance, Conflicts\nResolution,\nControllers, Legal,\nRisk and Tax.\n\nInternal Audit is\nconsidered our third\nline of defense, and\nour director of\nInternal Audit reports\nto the Audit Committee\nof the Board and\nadministratively to\nour chief executive\nofficer. Internal\nAudit includes\nprofessionals with a\nbroad range of audit\nand industry\nexperience, including\nrisk management\nexpertise. Internal\nAudit is responsible\nfor independently\nassessing and\nvalidating the\neffectiveness of key\ncontrols, including\nthose within the risk\nmanagement framework,\nand providing timely\nreporting to the Audit\nCommittee of the\nBoard, senior\nmanagement and\nregulators.\n                                              \n  139    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form    \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nThe three lines of\ndefense structure\npromotes the\naccountability of\nfirst line risk\ntakers, provides a\nframework for\neffective challenge by\nthe second line and\nempowers independent\nreview from the third\nline.\n\nProcesses. We maintain\nvarious processes that\nare critical\ncomponents of our risk\nmanagement framework,\nincluding (i) risk\nidentification and\nassessment, (ii) risk\nappetite, limit and\nthreshold setting,\n(iii) risk reporting\nand monitoring, and\n(iv) risk decision-\nmaking.\n\n\u2022 Risk Identification\nand Assessment. We\nbelieve that the\nidentification and\nassessment of our\nrisks is a critical\nstep in providing our\nBoard and senior\nmanagement\ntransparency and\ninsight into the range\nand materiality of our\nrisks. We have a\ncomprehensive data\ncollection process,\nincluding firmwide\npolicies and\nprocedures that\nrequire all employees\nto report and escalate\nrisk events. Our\napproach for risk\nidentification and\nassessment is\ncomprehensive across\nall risk types, is\ndynamic and forward-\nlooking to reflect and\nadapt to our changing\nrisk profile and\nbusiness environment,\nleverages subject\nmatter expertise, and\nallows for\nprioritization of our\nmost critical risks.\n\nTo effectively assess\nour risks, we maintain\na daily discipline of\nmarking substantially\nall of our inventory\nto current market\nlevels. We carry our\ninventory at fair\nvalue, with changes in\nvaluation reflected\nimmediately in our\nrisk management\nsystems and in net\nrevenues. We do so\nbecause we believe\nthis discipline is one\nof the most effective\ntools for assessing\nand managing risk and\nthat it provides\ntransparent and\nrealistic insight into\nour inventory\nexposures.\n\nAn important part of\nour risk management\nprocess is firmwide\nstress testing. It\nallows us to quantify\nour exposure to tail\nrisks, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations,\nundertake risk/reward\nanalysis, and assess\nand mitigate our risk\npositions. Firmwide\nstress tests are\nperformed on a regular\nbasis and are designed\nto ensure a\ncomprehensive analysis\nof our vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic\nrisks combining\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, credit,\nmarket, liquidity and\nfunding, operational\nand compliance,\nstrategic, systemic\nand emerging risks\ninto a single combined\nscenario. We also\nperform ad hoc stress\ntests in anticipation\nof market events or\nconditions. Stress\ntests are also used to\nassess capital\nadequacy as part of\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess. See \u201cCapital\nManagement and\nRegulatory Capital \u2014\nCapital Management\u201d\nfor further\ninformation.\n\n\u2022 Risk Appetite, Limit\nand Threshold Setting.\nWe apply a rigorous\nframework of limits\nand thresholds to\ncontrol and monitor\nrisk across\ntransactions,\nproducts, businesses\nand markets. The\nBoard, directly or\nindirectly through its\nRisk Committee,\napproves limits and\nthresholds included in\nour risk appetite\nstatement at firmwide,\nbusiness and product\nlevels. In addition,\nthe Firmwide\nEnterprise Risk\nCommittee is\nresponsible for\napproving our risk\nlimits framework,\nsubject to the overall\nlimits approved by the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard, and monitoring\nthese limits.\n\nThe Risk Governance\nCommittee is\nresponsible for\napproving limits at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels.\nCertain limits may be\nset at levels that\nwill require periodic\nadjustment, rather\nthan at levels that\nreflect our maximum\nrisk appetite. This\nfosters an ongoing\ndialogue about risk\namong our first and\nsecond lines of\ndefense, committees\nand senior management,\nas well as rapid\nescalation of risk-\nrelated matters.\nAdditionally, through\ndelegated authority\nfrom the Risk\nGovernance Committee,\nMarket Risk sets\nlimits at certain\nproduct and desk\nlevels, and Credit\nRisk sets limits for\nindividual\ncounterparties,\ncounterparties and\ntheir subsidiaries,\nindustries and\ncountries. Limits are\nreviewed regularly and\namended on a permanent\nor temporary basis to\nreflect changing\nmarket conditions,\nbusiness conditions or\nrisk tolerance.\n\n\u2022 Risk Reporting and\nMonitoring. Effective\nrisk reporting and\nrisk decision-making\ndepends on our ability\nto get the right\ninformation to the\nright people at the\nright time. As such,\nwe focus on the rigor\nand effectiveness of\nour risk systems, with\nthe objective of\nensuring that our risk\nmanagement technology\nsystems provide us\nwith complete,\naccurate and timely\ninformation. Our risk\nreporting and\nmonitoring processes\nare designed to take\ninto account\ninformation about both\nexisting and emerging\nrisks, thereby\nenabling our risk\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement to perform\ntheir responsibilities\nwith the appropriate\nlevel of insight into\nrisk exposures.\nFurthermore, our limit\nand threshold breach\nprocesses provide\nmeans for timely\nescalation. We\nevaluate changes in\nour risk profile and\nour businesses,\nincluding changes in\nbusiness mix or\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate, by\nmonitoring risk\nfactors at a firmwide\nlevel.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form      140  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \n\u2022 Risk Decision-\nMaking. Our governance\nstructure provides the\nprotocol and\nresponsibility for\ndecision-making on\nrisk management issues\nand ensures\nimplementation of\nthose decisions. We\nmake extensive use of\nrisk committees that\nmeet regularly and\nserve as an important\nmeans to facilitate\nand foster ongoing\ndiscussions to manage\nand mitigate risks.\n\nWe maintain strong and\nproactive\ncommunication about\nrisk and we have a\nculture of\ncollaboration in\ndecision-making among\nour first and second\nlines of defense,\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement. While our\nfirst line of defense\nis responsible for\nmanagement of their\nrisk, we dedicate\nextensive resources to\nour second line of\ndefense in order to\nensure a strong\noversight structure\nand an appropriate\nsegregation of duties.\nWe regularly reinforce\nour strong culture of\nescalation and\naccountability across\nall functions.\n\nPeople. Even the best\ntechnology serves only\nas a tool for helping\nto make informed\ndecisions in real time\nabout the risks we are\ntaking. Ultimately,\neffective risk\nmanagement requires\nour people to\ninterpret our risk\ndata on an ongoing and\ntimely basis and\nadjust risk positions\naccordingly. The\nexperience of our\nprofessionals, and\ntheir understanding of\nthe nuances and\nlimitations of each\nrisk measure, guides\nus in assessing\nexposures and\nmaintaining them\nwithin prudent levels.\n\nWe reinforce a culture\nof effective risk\nmanagement, consistent\nwith our risk\nappetite, in our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nas well as in the way\nwe evaluate\nperformance, and\nrecognize and reward\nour people. Our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nincluding certain\nsessions led by our\nmost senior leaders,\nare focused on the\nimportance of risk\nmanagement, client\nrelationships and\nreputational\nexcellence. As part of\nour performance review\nprocess, we assess\nreputational\nexcellence, including\nhow an employee\nexercises good risk\nmanagement and\nreputational judgment,\nand adheres to our\ncode of conduct and\ncompliance policies.\nOur review and reward\nprocesses are designed\nto communicate and\nreinforce to our\nprofessionals the link\nbetween behavior and\nhow people are\nrecognized, the need\nto focus on our\nclients and our\nreputation, and the\nneed to always act in\naccordance with our\nhighest standards.\n                                              \n  Structure                                   \n                                              \nUltimate oversight of\nrisk is the\nresponsibility of our\nBoard. The Board\noversees risk both\ndirectly and through\nits committees,\nincluding its Risk\nCommittee. We also\nhave a series of\ncommittees with\nspecific risk\nmanagement mandates\nthat have oversight or\ndecision-making\nresponsibilities for\nrisk management\nactivities. Committee\nmembership generally\nconsists of senior\nmanagers from both our\nfirst and second lines\nof defense. We have\nestablished procedures\nfor these committees\nto ensure that\nappropriate\ninformation barriers\nare in place. Our\nprimary risk\ncommittees, most of\nwhich also have\nadditional sub-\ncommittees, councils\nor working groups, are\ndescribed below. In\naddition to these\ncommittees, we have\nother risk committees\nthat provide oversight\nfor different\nbusinesses,\nactivities, products,\nregions and entities.\nAll of our committees\nhave responsibility\nfor considering the\nimpact on our\nreputation of the\ntransactions and\nactivities that they\noversee.\n\nMembership of our risk\ncommittees is reviewed\nregularly and updated\nto reflect changes in\nthe responsibilities\nof the committee\nmembers. Accordingly,\nthe length of time\nthat members serve on\nthe respective\ncommittees varies as\ndetermined by the\ncommittee chairs and\nbased on the\nresponsibilities of\nthe members.\n\nThe chart below\npresents an overview\nof our risk management\ngovernance structure.\n\nManagement Committee.\nThe Management\nCommittee oversees our\nglobal activities.

GCLA is\nliquidity that we\nmaintain to meet a\nbroad range of\npotential cash\noutflows and\ncollateral needs in a\nstressed environment.\nA primary liquidity\nprinciple is to pre-\nfund our estimated\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs\nduring a liquidity\ncrisis and hold this\nliquidity in the form\nof unencumbered,\nhighly liquid\nsecurities and cash.\nWe believe that the\nsecurities held in our\nGCLA would be readily\nconvertible to cash in\na matter of days,\nthrough liquidation,\nby entering into\nrepurchase agreements\nor from maturities of\nresale agreements, and\nthat this cash would\nallow us to meet\nimmediate obligations\nwithout needing to\nsell other assets or\ndepend on additional\nfunding from credit-\nsensitive markets.\n\nOur GCLA reflects the\nfollowing principles:\n\n\u2022 The first days or\nweeks of a liquidity\ncrisis are the most\ncritical to a\ncompany\u2019s survival;\n\n\u2022 Focus must be\nmaintained on all\npotential cash and\ncollateral outflows,\nnot just disruptions\nto financing flows.\nOur businesses are\ndiverse, and our\nliquidity needs are\ndetermined by many\nfactors, including\nmarket movements,\ncollateral\nrequirements and\nclient commitments,\nall of which can\nchange dramatically in\na difficult funding\nenvironment;\n\n\u2022 During a liquidity\ncrisis, credit-\nsensitive funding,\nincluding unsecured\ndebt, certain deposits\nand some types of\nsecured financing\nagreements, may be\nunavailable, and the\nterms (e.g., interest\nrates, collateral\nprovisions and tenor)\nor availability of\nother types of secured\nfinancing may change\nand certain deposits\nmay be withdrawn; and\n\n\u2022 As a result of our\npolicy to pre-fund\nliquidity that we\nestimate may be needed\nin a crisis, we hold\nmore unencumbered\nsecurities and have\nlarger funding\nbalances than our\nbusinesses would\notherwise require. We\nbelieve that our\nliquidity is stronger\nwith greater balances\nof highly liquid\nunencumbered\nsecurities, even\nthough it increases\nour total assets and\nour funding costs.\n\nWe maintain our GCLA\nacross Group Inc.,\nGoldman Sachs Funding\nLLC (Funding IHC) and\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries, asset\ntypes and clearing\nagents to provide us\nwith sufficient\noperating liquidity to\nensure timely\nsettlement in all\nmajor markets, even in\na difficult funding\nenvironment. In\naddition to the GCLA,\nwe maintain cash\nbalances and\nsecurities in several\nof our other entities,\nprimarily for use in\nspecific currencies,\nentities or\njurisdictions where we\ndo not have immediate\naccess to parent\ncompany liquidity.\n\nAsset-Liability\nManagement. Our\nliquidity risk\nmanagement policies\nare designed to ensure\nwe have a sufficient\namount of financing,\neven when funding\nmarkets experience\npersistent stress. We\nmanage the maturities\nand diversity of our\nfunding across\nmarkets, products and\ncounterparties, and\nseek to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nOur approach to asset-\nliability management\nincludes:\n\n\u2022 Conservatively\nmanaging the overall\ncharacteristics of our\nfunding book, with a\nfocus on maintaining\nlong-term, diversified\nsources of funding in\nexcess of our current\nrequirements. See\n\u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nFunding Sources\u201d for\nfurther information;\n\n\u2022 Actively managing\nand monitoring our\nasset base, with\nparticular focus on\nthe liquidity, holding\nperiod and ability to\nfund assets on a\nsecured basis. We\nassess our funding\nrequirements and our\nability to liquidate\nassets in a stressed\nenvironment while\nappropriately managing\nrisk. This enables us\nto determine the most\nappropriate funding\nproducts and tenors.\nSee \u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nBalance Sheet\nManagement\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our balance\nsheet management\nprocess and \u201c\u2014 Funding\nSources \u2014 Secured\nFunding\u201d for further\ninformation about\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis; and\n\n\u2022 Raising secured and\nunsecured financing\nthat has a long tenor\nrelative to the\nliquidity profile of\nour assets. This\nreduces the risk that\nour liabilities will\ncome due in advance of\nour ability to\ngenerate liquidity\nfrom the sale of our\nassets. Because we\nmaintain a highly\nliquid balance sheet,\nthe holding period of\ncertain of our assets\nmay be materially\nshorter than their\ncontractual maturity\ndates.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form      144  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nOur goal is to ensure\nthat we maintain\nsufficient liquidity\nto fund our assets and\nmeet our contractual\nand contingent\nobligations in normal\ntimes, as well as\nduring periods of\nmarket stress. Through\nour dynamic balance\nsheet management\nprocess, we use actual\nand projected asset\nbalances to determine\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding requirements.\nFunding plans are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee.\nIn addition, our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions analyze, and\nthe Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee\nreviews, our\nconsolidated total\ncapital position\n(unsecured long-term\nborrowings plus total\nshareholders\u2019 equity)\nso that we maintain a\nlevel of long-term\nfunding that is\nsufficient to meet our\nlong-term financing\nrequirements. In a\nliquidity crisis, we\nwould first use our\nGCLA in order to avoid\nreliance on asset\nsales (other than our\nGCLA). However, we\nrecognize that orderly\nasset sales may be\nprudent or necessary\nin a severe or\npersistent liquidity\ncrisis.\nSubsidiary Funding\nPolicies\nThe majority of our\nunsecured funding is\nraised by Group Inc.,\nwhich provides the\nnecessary funds to\nFunding IHC and other\nsubsidiaries, some of\nwhich are regulated,\nto meet their asset\nfinancing, liquidity\nand capital\nrequirements. In\naddition, Group Inc.\nprovides its regulated\nsubsidiaries with the\nnecessary capital to\nmeet their regulatory\nrequirements. The\nbenefits of this\napproach to subsidiary\nfunding are enhanced\ncontrol and greater\nflexibility to meet\nthe funding\nrequirements of our\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nis also raised at the\nsubsidiary level\nthrough a variety of\nproducts, including\ndeposits, secured\nfunding and unsecured\nborrowings.\n\nOur intercompany\nfunding policies\nassume that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s funds or\nsecurities are not\nfreely available to\nits parent, Funding\nIHC or other\nsubsidiaries unless\n(i) legally provided\nfor and (ii) there are\nno additional\nregulatory, tax or\nother restrictions. In\nparticular, many of\nour subsidiaries are\nsubject to laws that\nauthorize regulatory\nbodies to block or\nreduce the flow of\nfunds from those\nsubsidiaries to Group\nInc. or Funding IHC.\nRegulatory action of\nthat kind could impede\naccess to funds that\nGroup Inc. needs to\nmake payments on its\nobligations.\nAccordingly, we assume\nthat the capital\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or other\nsubsidiaries and any\nother financing\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or Funding\nIHC until the maturity\nof such financing.\n\nGroup Inc. has\nprovided substantial\namounts of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness, directly\nor indirectly, to its\nregulated\nsubsidiaries. For\nexample, as of\nSeptember 2022, Group\nInc. had $38.27\nbillion of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness invested\nin GS&Co., its\nprincipal U.S.\nregistered broker-\ndealer; $48.29 billion\ninvested in GSI, a\nregulated U.K. broker-\ndealer; $2.53 billion\ninvested in GSJCL, a\nregulated Japanese\nbroker-dealer; $51.51\nbillion invested in GS\nBank USA, a regulated\nNew York State-\nchartered bank; and\n$4.21 billion invested\nin GSIB, a regulated\nU.K. bank. Group Inc.\nalso provides\nfinancing, directly or\nindirectly, in the\nform of: $97.56\nbillion of\nunsubordinated loans\n(including secured\nloans of $46.10\nbillion) and $35.35\nbillion of collateral\nand cash deposits to\nthese entities as of\nSeptember 2022. In\naddition, as of\nSeptember 2022, Group\nInc. had significant\namounts of capital\ninvested in and loans\nto its other regulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nContingency Funding\nPlan. We maintain a\ncontingency funding\nplan to provide a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nliquidity crisis\nsituation or periods\nof market stress. Our\ncontingency funding\nplan outlines a list\nof potential risk\nfactors, key reports\nand metrics that are\nreviewed on an ongoing\nbasis to assist in\nassessing the severity\nof, and managing\nthrough, a liquidity\ncrisis and/or market\ndislocation. The\ncontingency funding\nplan also describes in\ndetail our potential\nresponses if our\nassessments indicate\nthat we have entered a\nliquidity crisis,\nwhich include pre-\nfunding for what we\nestimate will be our\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs, as\nwell as utilizing\nsecondary sources of\nliquidity. Mitigants\nand action items to\naddress specific risks\nwhich may arise are\nalso described and\nassigned to\nindividuals\nresponsible for\nexecution.\n\nThe contingency\nfunding plan\nidentifies key groups\nof individuals and\ntheir\nresponsibilities,\nwhich include\nfostering effective\ncoordination, control\nand distribution of\ninformation,\nimplementing liquidity\nmaintenance activities\nand managing internal\nand external\ncommunication, all of\nwhich are critical in\nthe management of a\ncrisis or period of\nmarket stress.\n                                              \n  145    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form    \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

One of our\nprimary internal\nliquidity risk models,\nreferred to as the\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow, quantifies\nour liquidity risks\nover a 30-day stress\nscenario. We also\nconsider other\nfactors, including,\nbut not limited to, an\nassessment of our\npotential intraday\nliquidity needs\nthrough an additional\ninternal liquidity\nrisk model, referred\nto as the Intraday\nLiquidity Model, the\nresults of our long-\nterm stress testing\nmodels, our resolution\nliquidity models and\nother applicable\nregulatory\nrequirements and a\nqualitative assessment\nof our condition, as\nwell as the financial\nmarkets. The results\nof the Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow, the\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel, the long-term\nstress testing models\nand the resolution\nliquidity models are\nreported to senior\nmanagement on a\nregular basis. We also\nperform firmwide\nstress tests. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\n\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow. Our Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow is\nbased on conducting\nmultiple scenarios\nthat include\ncombinations of\nmarket-wide and firm-\nspecific stress. These\nscenarios are\ncharacterized by the\nfollowing qualitative\nelements:\n\n\u2022 Severely challenged\nmarket environments,\nwhich include low\nconsumer and corporate\nconfidence, financial\nand political\ninstability, and\nadverse changes in\nmarket values,\nincluding potential\ndeclines in equity\nmarkets and widening\nof credit spreads; and\n\n\u2022 A firm-specific\ncrisis potentially\ntriggered by material\nlosses, reputational\ndamage, litigation\nand/or a ratings\ndowngrade.\n\nThe following are key\nmodeling elements of\nour Modeled Liquidity\nOutflow:\n\n\u2022 Liquidity needs over\na 30-day scenario;\n\n\u2022 A two-notch\ndowngrade of our long-\nterm senior unsecured\ncredit ratings;\n\n\u2022 Changing conditions\nin funding markets,\nwhich limit our access\nto unsecured and\nsecured funding;\n\n\u2022 No support from\nadditional government\nfunding facilities.\nAlthough we have\naccess to various\ncentral bank funding\nprograms, we do not\nassume reliance on\nadditional sources of\nfunding in a liquidity\ncrisis; and\n\n\u2022 A combination of\ncontractual outflows\nand contingent\noutflows arising from\nboth our on- and off-\nbalance sheet\narrangements.\nContractual outflows\ninclude, among other\nthings, upcoming\nmaturities of\nunsecured debt, term\ndeposits and secured\nfunding. Contingent\noutflows include,\namong other things,\nthe withdrawal of\ncustomer credit\nbalances in our prime\nbrokerage business,\nincrease in variation\nmargin requirements\ndue to adverse changes\nin the value of our\nexchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared\nderivatives, draws on\nunfunded commitments\nand withdrawals of\ndeposits that have no\ncontractual maturity.\nSee notes to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\ncontractual outflows,\nincluding Note 11 for\ncollateralized\nfinancings, Note 13\nfor deposits, Note 14\nfor unsecured long-\nterm borrowings and\nNote 15 for operating\nlease payments, and\n\u201cOff-Balance Sheet\nArrangements\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our various\ntypes of off-balance\nsheet arrangements.\n\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel. Our Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nmeasures our intraday\nliquidity needs using\na scenario analysis\ncharacterized by the\nsame qualitative\nelements as our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow. The model\nassesses the risk of\nincreased intraday\nliquidity requirements\nduring a scenario\nwhere access to\nsources of intraday\nliquidity may become\nconstrained.\n\nLong-Term Stress\nTesting. We utilize\nlonger-term stress\ntests to take a\nforward view on our\nliquidity position\nthrough prolonged\nstress periods in\nwhich we experience a\nsevere liquidity\nstress and recover in\nan environment that\ncontinues to be\nchallenging. We are\nfocused on ensuring\nconservative asset-\nliability management\nto prepare for a\nprolonged period of\npotential stress,\nseeking to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nResolution Liquidity\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established our\nResolution Liquidity\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich estimates\nliquidity needs of our\nmajor subsidiaries in\na stressed\nenvironment. The\nliquidity needs are\nmeasured using our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow assumptions\nand include certain\nadditional inter-\naffiliate exposures.\nWe have also\nestablished our\nResolution Liquidity\nExecution Need\nframework, which\nmeasures the liquidity\nneeds of our major\nsubsidiaries to\nstabilize and wind\ndown following a Group\nInc. bankruptcy filing\nin accordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIn addition, we have\nestablished a triggers\nand alerts framework,\nwhich is designed to\nprovide the Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form      146  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Limits are\nmeasured relative to\nacceptable levels of\nrisk given our\nliquidity risk\ntolerance. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess. Limits are\nmonitored by Treasury\nand Liquidity Risk.\nLiquidity Risk is\nresponsible for\nidentifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded. GCLA and\nUnencumbered Metrics\nGCLA. Based on the\nresults of our\ninternal liquidity\nrisk models, described\nabove, as well as our\nconsideration of other\nfactors, including,\nbut not limited to, a\nqualitative assessment\nof our condition, as\nwell as the financial\nmarkets, we believe\nour liquidity position\nas of both September\n2022 and December 2021\nwas appropriate. We\nstrictly limit our\nGCLA to a narrowly\ndefined list of\nsecurities and cash\nbecause they are\nhighly liquid, even in\na difficult funding\nenvironment. We do not\ninclude other\npotential sources of\nexcess liquidity in\nour GCLA, such as less\nliquid unencumbered\nsecurities or\ncommitted credit\nfacilities.

Our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow and Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nincorporate a\nrequirement for Group\nInc., as well as a\nstandalone requirement\nfor each of our major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nIHC is required to\nprovide the necessary\nliquidity to Group\nInc. during the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, and is also\nobligated to provide\ncapital and liquidity\nsupport to major\nsubsidiaries in the\nevent of our material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure. Liquidity\nheld directly in each\nof our major broker-\ndealer and bank\nsubsidiaries is\nintended for use only\nby that subsidiary to\nmeet its liquidity\nrequirements and is\nassumed not to be\navailable to Group\nInc. or Funding IHC\nunless (i) legally\nprovided for and (ii)\nthere are no\nadditional regulatory,\ntax or other\nrestrictions. In\naddition, the Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow and\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel also incorporate\na broader assessment\nof standalone\nliquidity requirements\nfor other subsidiaries\nand we hold a portion\nof our GCLA directly\nat Group Inc. or\nFunding IHC to support\nsuch requirements.\nOther Unencumbered\nAssets. In addition to\nour GCLA, we have a\nsignificant amount of\nother unencumbered\ncash and financial\ninstruments, including\nother government\nobligations, high-\ngrade money market\nsecurities, corporate\nobligations,\nmarginable equities,\nloans and cash\ndeposits not included\nin our GCLA. The fair\nvalue of our\nunencumbered assets\naveraged $269.71\nbillion for the three\nmonths ended September\n2022 and $279.07\nbillion for the three\nmonths ended June\n2022. We do not\nconsider these assets\nliquid enough to be\neligible for our GCLA.\nLiquidity Regulatory\nFramework As a BHC, we\nare subject to a\nminimum Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR)\nunder the LCR rule\napproved by the U.S.\nfederal bank\nregulatory agencies.\nThe LCR rule requires\norganizations to\nmaintain an adequate\nratio of eligible\nhigh-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) to\nexpected net cash\noutflows under an\nacute, short-term\nliquidity stress\nscenario. Eligible\nHQLA excludes HQLA\nheld by subsidiaries\nthat is in excess of\ntheir minimum\nrequirement and is\nsubject to transfer\nrestrictions. We are\nrequired to maintain a\nminimum LCR of 100%.\nWe expect that\nfluctuations in client\nactivity, business mix\nand the market\nenvironment will\nimpact our LCR.

Certain of our derivatives have\nbeen transacted under bilateral agreements\nwith counterparties who may require us to post\ncollateral or terminate the transactions based\non changes in our credit ratings. We manage\nour GCLA to ensure we would, among other\npotential requirements, be able to make the\nadditional collateral or termination payments\nthat may be required in the event of a two-\nnotch reduction in our long-term credit\nratings, as well as collateral that has not\nbeen called by counterparties, but is\navailable to them.\n\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial\nstatements for further information about\nderivatives with credit-related contingent\nfeatures and the additional collateral or\ntermination payments related to our net\nderivative liabilities under bilateral\nagreements that could have been called by\ncounterparties in the event of a one- or two-\nnotch downgrade in our credit ratings. Cash\nFlows As a global financial institution, our\ncash flows are complex and bear little\nrelation to our net earnings and net assets.\nConsequently, we believe that traditional cash\nflow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating\nour liquidity position than the liquidity and\nasset-liability management policies described\nabove. Cash flow analysis may, however, be\nhelpful in highlighting certain macro trends\nand strategic initiatives in our businesses.\nNine Months Ended September 2022 . Our cash\nand cash equivalents increased by $23.22\nbillion to $284.25 billion at the end of the\nthird quarter of 2022, due to net cash\nprovided by financing and operating\nactivities, partially offset by net cash used\nfor investing activities. The net cash\nprovided by financing activities primarily\nreflected cash inflows from deposits\n(reflecting increases in transaction banking,\ndeposit sweep program balances, brokered\ncertificates of deposit, and consumer\ndeposits, partially offset by a decrease in\nother deposits) and net issuance of unsecured\nlong-term borrowings. The net cash provided by\noperating activities primarily reflected cash\ninflows from trading liabilities and customer\nand other receivables and payables, net\n(reflecting both an increase in customer and\nother payables and in customer and other\nreceivables), partially offset by cash\noutflows from trading assets. The net cash\nused for investing activities primarily\nreflected purchases of investments (primarily\nU.S. government obligations accounted for as\nheld-to-maturity) and an increase in net\nlending activities (reflecting increases in\ncorporate, consumer and wealth management\nloans). Nine Months Ended September 2021. Our\ncash and cash equivalents increased by $55.99\nbillion to $211.83 billion at the end of the\nthird quarter of 2021, due to net cash\nprovided by financing activities, partially\noffset by net cash used for operating\nactivities and investing activities. The net\ncash provided by financing activities\nprimarily reflected an increase in net\ndeposits (principally reflecting increases in\ninstitutional, transaction banking, private\nbank, consumer and deposit sweep program\nbalances) and net issuance of unsecured long-\nterm borrowings. The net cash used for\noperating activities primarily reflected an\nincrease in collateralized transactions (an\nincrease in collateralized agreements,\npartially offset by an increase in\ncollateralized financings), partially offset\nby an increase in trading liabilities. The net\ncash used for investing activities primarily\nreflected purchases of investments and an\nincrease in net lending activities, partially\noffset by sales and paydowns of investments.\n                                              \n  149    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form    \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nhistorical data is\nweighted so that the\nrelative importance of\nthe data reduces over\ntime. This gives\ngreater importance to\nmore recent\nobservations and\nreflects current asset\nvolatilities, which\nimproves the accuracy\nof our estimates of\npotential loss. As a\nresult, even if our\npositions included in\nVaR were unchanged,\nour VaR would increase\nwith increasing market\nvolatility and vice\nversa.\n\nGiven its reliance on\nhistorical data, VaR\nis most effective in\nestimating risk\nexposures in markets\nin which there are no\nsudden fundamental\nchanges or shifts in\nmarket conditions.\n\nOur VaR measure does\nnot include:\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nbest measured and\nmonitored using\nsensitivity measures;\nand\n\n\u2022 The impact of\nchanges in\ncounterparty and our\nown credit spreads on\nderivatives, as well\nas changes in our own\ncredit spreads on\nfinancial liabilities\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected.\n\nWe perform daily\nbacktesting of our VaR\nmodel (i.e., comparing\ndaily net revenues for\npositions included in\nVaR to the VaR measure\ncalculated as of the\nprior business day) at\nthe firmwide level and\nfor each of our\nbusinesses and major\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nStress Testing. Stress\ntesting is a method of\ndetermining the effect\nof various\nhypothetical stress\nscenarios. We use\nstress testing to\nexamine risks of\nspecific portfolios,\nas well as the\npotential impact of\nour significant risk\nexposures. We use a\nvariety of stress\ntesting techniques to\ncalculate the\npotential loss from a\nwide range of market\nmoves on our\nportfolios, including\nfirmwide stress tests,\nsensitivity analysis\nand scenario analysis.\nThe results of our\nvarious stress tests\nare analyzed together\nfor risk management\npurposes. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\n\nSensitivity analysis\nis used to quantify\nthe impact of a market\nmove in a single risk\nfactor across all\npositions (e.g.,\nequity prices or\ncredit spreads) using\na variety of defined\nmarket shocks, ranging\nfrom those that could\nbe expected over a\none-day time horizon\nup to those that could\ntake many months to\noccur. We also use\nsensitivity analysis\nto quantify the impact\nof the default of any\nsingle entity, which\ncaptures the risk of\nlarge or concentrated\nexposures.\n\nScenario analysis is\nused to quantify the\nimpact of a specified\nevent, including how\nthe event impacts\nmultiple risk factors\nsimultaneously. For\nexample, for sovereign\nstress testing we\ncalculate potential\ndirect exposure\nassociated with our\nsovereign positions,\nas well as the\ncorresponding debt,\nequity and currency\nexposures associated\nwith our non-sovereign\npositions that may be\nimpacted by the\nsovereign distress.\nWhen conducting\nscenario analysis, we\noften consider a\nnumber of possible\noutcomes for each\nscenario, ranging from\nmoderate to severely\nadverse market\nimpacts. In addition,\nthese stress tests are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical events and\nforward-looking\nhypothetical\nscenarios.\n\nUnlike VaR measures,\nwhich have an implied\nprobability because\nthey are calculated at\na specified confidence\nlevel, there may not\nbe an implied\nprobability that our\nstress testing\nscenarios will occur.\nInstead, stress\ntesting is used to\nmodel both moderate\nand more extreme moves\nin underlying market\nfactors. When\nestimating potential\nloss, we generally\nassume that our\npositions cannot be\nreduced or hedged\n(although experience\ndemonstrates that we\nare generally able to\ndo so).\n                                              \n  Limits                                      \n                                              \nWe use market risk\nlimits at various\nlevels to manage the\nsize of our market\nexposures. These\nlimits are set based\non VaR and on a range\nof stress tests\nrelevant to our\nexposures. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess.\n\nMarket Risk is\nresponsible for\nmonitoring these\nlimits, and\nidentifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded (e.g., due to\npositional changes or\nchanges in market\nconditions, such as\nincreased volatilities\nor changes in\ncorrelations). Such\ninstances are\nremediated by a\nreduction in the\npositions we hold\nand/or a temporary or\npermanent increase to\nthe limit, if\nwarranted.\n                                              \n  151    Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form    \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Credit and Funding Spread\nSensitivity on Derivatives and Financial\nLiabilities. VaR excludes the impact of\nchanges in counterparty credit spreads, our\nown credit spreads and unsecured funding\nspreads on derivatives, as well as changes in\nour own credit spreads (debt valuation\nadjustment) on financial liabilities for which\nthe fair value option was elected. The\nestimated sensitivity to a one basis point\nincrease in credit spreads (counterparty and\nour own) and unsecured funding spreads on\nderivatives (including hedges) was a loss of\n$2 million as of both September 2022 and June\n2022. In addition, the estimated sensitivity\nto a one basis point increase in our own\ncredit spreads on financial liabilities for\nwhich the fair value option was elected was a\ngain of $33 million as of September 2022 and\n$35 million as of June 2022. However, the\nactual net impact of a change in our own\ncredit spreads is also affected by the\nliquidity, duration and convexity (as the\nsensitivity is not linear to changes in\nyields) of those financial liabilities for\nwhich the fair value option was elected, as\nwell as the relative performance of any hedges\nundertaken. Interest Rate Sensitivity. Loans\naccounted for at amortized cost were $161.62\nbillion as of September 2022 and $159.40\nbillion as of June 2022, substantially all of\nwhich had floating interest rates. The\nestimated sensitivity to a 100 basis point\nincrease in interest rates on such loans was\n$1.32 billion as of September 2022 and $1.33\nbillion as of June 2022 of additional interest\nincome over a twelve-month period, which does\nnot take into account the potential impact of\nan increase in costs to fund such loans.

Our\nexposure to credit risk comes mostly from\nclient transactions in OTC derivatives and\nloans and lending commitments. Credit risk\nalso comes from cash placed with banks,\nsecurities financing transactions (i.e.,\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending activities)\nand customer and other receivables.\n\nCredit Risk, which is independent of our\nrevenue-producing units and reports to our\nchief risk officer, has primary responsibility\nfor assessing, monitoring and managing our\ncredit risk through firmwide oversight across\nour global businesses. In addition, we hold\nother positions that give rise to credit risk\n(e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These\ncredit risks are captured as a component of\nmarket risk measures, which are monitored and\nmanaged by Market Risk. We also enter into\nderivatives to manage market risk exposures.\nSuch derivatives also give rise to credit\nrisk, which is monitored and managed by Credit\nRisk. Credit Risk Management Process Our\nprocess for managing credit risk includes the\ncritical components of our risk management\nframework described in the \u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk Management,\u201d as well as the\nfollowing: \u2022 Monitoring compliance with\nestablished credit risk limits and reporting\nour credit exposures and credit\nconcentrations; \u2022 Establishing or approving\nunderwriting standards; \u2022 Assessing the\nlikelihood that a counterparty will default on\nits payment obligations; \u2022 Measuring our\ncurrent and potential credit exposure and\nlosses resulting from a counterparty default;\n\u2022 Using credit risk mitigants, including\ncollateral and hedging; and \u2022 Maximizing\nrecovery through active workout and\nrestructuring of claims. We also perform\ncredit analyses, which incorporate initial and\nongoing evaluations of the capacity and\nwillingness of a counterparty to meet its\nfinancial obligations. For substantially all\nof our credit exposures, the core of our\nprocess is an annual counterparty credit\nevaluation or more frequently if deemed\nnecessary as a result of events or changes in\ncircumstances. We determine an internal credit\nrating for the counterparty by considering the\nresults of the credit evaluations and\nassumptions with respect to the nature of and\noutlook for the counterparty\u2019s industry and\nthe economic environment. The internal credit\nrating does not take into consideration\ncollateral received or other credit support\narrangements. Senior personnel, with expertise\nin specific industries, inspect and approve\ncredit reviews and internal credit ratings.\nOur risk assessment process may also include,\nwhere applicable, reviewing certain key\nmetrics, including, but not limited to,\ndelinquency status, collateral values, FICO\ncredit scores and other risk factors.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form      154  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For\nloans and lending\ncommitments, the\nprimary measure is a\nfunction of the\nnotional amount of the\nposition.\n                                              \n  Stress Tests                                \n                                              \nWe conduct regular\nstress tests to\ncalculate the credit\nexposures, including\npotential\nconcentrations that\nwould result from\napplying shocks to\ncounterparty credit\nratings or credit risk\nfactors (e.g.,\ncurrency rates,\ninterest rates, equity\nprices). These shocks\ncover a wide range of\nmoderate and more\nextreme market\nmovements, including\nshocks to multiple\nrisk factors,\nconsistent with the\noccurrence of a severe\nmarket or economic\nevent. In the case of\nsovereign default, we\nestimate the direct\nimpact of the default\non our sovereign\ncredit exposures,\nchanges to our credit\nexposures arising from\npotential market moves\nin response to the\ndefault, and the\nimpact of credit\nmarket deterioration\non corporate borrowers\nand counterparties\nthat may result from\nthe sovereign default.\nUnlike potential\nexposure, which is\ncalculated within a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, stress testing\ndoes not generally\nassume a probability\nof these events\noccurring. We also\nperform firmwide\nstress tests. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\n\nTo supplement these\nregular stress tests,\nas described above, we\nalso conduct tailored\nstress tests on an ad\nhoc basis in response\nto specific market\nevents that we deem\nsignificant. We also\nutilize these stress\ntests to estimate the\nindirect impact of\ncertain hypothetical\nevents on our country\nexposures, such as the\nimpact of credit\nmarket deterioration\non corporate borrowers\nand counterparties\nalong with the shocks\nto the risk factors\ndescribed above. The\nparameters of these\nshocks vary based on\nthe scenario reflected\nin each stress test.\nWe review estimated\nlosses produced by the\nstress tests in order\nto understand their\nmagnitude, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations, and\nassess and mitigate\nour exposures where\nnecessary.\n                                              \n  Limits                                      \n                                              \nWe use credit risk\nlimits at various\nlevels, as well as\nunderwriting standards\nto manage the size and\nnature of our credit\nexposures. Limits for\nindustries and\ncountries are based on\nour risk appetite and\nare designed to allow\nfor regular\nmonitoring, review,\nescalation and\nmanagement of credit\nrisk concentrations.\nSee \u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess.\n\nCredit Risk is\nresponsible for\nmonitoring these\nlimits, and\nidentifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded.\n                                              \n  Risk Mitigants                              \n                                              \nTo reduce our credit\nexposures on\nderivatives and\nsecurities financing\ntransactions, we may\nenter into netting\nagreements with\ncounterparties that\npermit us to offset\nreceivables and\npayables with such\ncounterparties. We may\nalso reduce credit\nrisk with\ncounterparties by\nentering into\nagreements that enable\nus to obtain\ncollateral from them\non an upfront or\ncontingent basis\nand/or to terminate\ntransactions if the\ncounterparty\u2019s credit\nrating falls below a\nspecified level. We\nmonitor the fair value\nof the collateral to\nensure that our credit\nexposures are\nappropriately\ncollateralized.

OTC\nDerivatives. Our\ncredit exposure on OTC\nderivatives arises\nprimarily from our\nmarket-making\nactivities. As a\nmarket maker, we enter\ninto derivative\ntransactions to\nprovide liquidity to\nclients and to\nfacilitate the\ntransfer and hedging\nof their risks. We\nalso enter into\nderivatives to manage\nmarket risk exposures.\nWe manage our credit\nexposure on OTC\nderivatives using the\ncredit risk process,\nmeasures, limits and\nrisk mitigants\ndescribed above.\n\nWe generally enter\ninto OTC derivatives\ntransactions under\nbilateral collateral\narrangements that\nrequire the daily\nexchange of\ncollateral. As credit\nrisk is an essential\ncomponent of fair\nvalue, we include a\ncredit valuation\nadjustment (CVA) in\nthe fair value of\nderivatives to reflect\ncounterparty credit\nrisk, as described in\nNote 7 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. CVA is a\nfunction of the\npresent value of\nexpected exposure, the\nprobability of\ncounterparty default\nand the assumed\nrecovery upon default.\nThe table below\npresents our net\ncredit exposure from\nOTC derivatives and\nthe concentration by\nindustry and region.\n                                              \n              As of                           \n                     Septem\u2026    Decem\u2026        \n  $ in                  2022            2021  \n  milli\u2026                                      \n  OTC                                         \n  deriv\u2026    $73,826             $58,6\u2026        \n  assets                                      \n  Colla\u2026                                      \n  (not                                        \n  netted    -19,502             -17,2\u2026        \n  under                                       \n  U.S.                                        \n  GAAP)                                       \n  Net                                         \n  credit    $54,324             $41,3\u2026        \n  expos\u2026                                      \n  Indus\u2026                                      \n  Consu\u2026                                      \n  &               2        %         2     %  \n  Retail                                      \n  Diver\u2026          8        %        10     %  \n  Indus\u2026                                      \n  Finan\u2026         16        %        15     %  \n  Insti\u2026                                      \n  Funds          23        %        13     %  \n  Healt\u2026          1        %         1     %  \n  Munic\u2026                                      \n  &               2        %         5     %  \n  Nonpr\u2026                                      \n  Natur\u2026                                      \n  Resou\u2026         36        %        33     %  \n  &                                           \n  Utili\u2026                                      \n  Sover\u2026          6        %         8     %  \n  Techn\u2026                                      \n  Media           3        %         8     %  \n  &                                           \n  Telec\u2026                                      \n  Other                                       \n  (incl\u2026                                      \n  Speci\u2026          3        %         5     %  \n  Purpo\u2026                                      \n  Vehic\u2026                                      \n  Total         100        %       100     %  \n  Region                                      \n  Ameri\u2026         47        %        53     %  \n  EMEA           42        %        37     %  \n  Asia           11        %        10     %  \n  Total         100        %       100     %  \n                                              \nOur credit exposure\n(before any potential\nrecoveries) to OTC\nderivative\ncounterparties that\ndefaulted during the\nnine months ended\nSeptember 2022\nremained low,\nrepresenting less than\n2% of our total credit\nexposure from OTC\nderivatives.

The\nRussian invasion of\nUkraine continues to\nnegatively affect the\nglobal economy and has\nresulted in\nsignificant\ndisruptions in\nfinancial markets and\nincreased\nmacroeconomic\nuncertainty.\nGovernments around the\nworld have responded\nto Russia\u2019s invasion\nby imposing economic\nsanctions and export\ncontrols on specific\nindustry sectors,\ncompanies and\nindividuals in Russia.\nRetaliatory\nrestrictions against\ninvestors, non-Russian\nowned businesses and\nother sovereign states\nhave been implemented\nby Russia. Businesses\nin the U.S. and\nglobally continue to\nexperience shortages\nin materials and\nincreased costs for\ntransportation, energy\nand raw materials due,\nin part, to the\nnegative effects of\nthe war on the global\neconomy. The\nescalation or\ncontinuation of the\nwar between Russia and\nUkraine presents\nheightened risks\nrelating to cyber\nattacks, the frequency\nand volume of failures\nto settle securities\ntransactions, supply\nchain disruptions, and\ninflation, as well as\nthe potential for\nincreased volatility\nin commodity, currency\nand other financial\nmarkets. Complying\nwith economic\nsanctions and\nrestrictions imposed\nby governments has\nresulted in increased\noperational risk. The\nextent and duration of\nthe war, sanctions and\nresulting market\ndisruptions, as well\nas the potential\nadverse consequences\nfor our business,\nliquidity and results\nof operations, are\ndifficult to predict.\n\nOur senior management,\nrisk committees and\nthe Board receive\nregular briefings from\nour independent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions, including\nour chief risk\nofficer, on Russian\nand Ukrainian\nexposures, as well as\nother relevant risk\nmetrics. We continue\nto focus on closing\nour positions and\nreducing our exposure\nto Russia and Ukraine,\nand wind down our\noperations in Russia.\nThe overall direct\nfinancial impact to\nour net revenues for\nthe nine months ended\nSeptember 2022 from\nRussian and Ukrainian\ncounterparties,\nborrowers, issuers and\nrelated instruments\nwas not material. We\nhave established a\nfirmwide working group\nto identify and assess\nthe operational risk\nassociated with\ncomplying with\neconomic sanctions and\nrestrictions as a\nresult of this\ninvasion. In addition,\nto mitigate the risk\nof increased cyber\nattacks, we liaise\nwith government\nagencies in order to\nupdate our monitoring\nprocesses with the\nlatest information.\n\nOur total credit\nexposure to Russia as\nof September 2022 was\n$205 million,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich was to non-\nsovereign\ncounterparties. Such\nexposure consisted of\n$13 million related to\nOTC derivatives and\n$192 million related\nto deposits and other\nreceivables. In\naddition, our total\nmarket exposure\nrelating to Russian\nissuers as of\nSeptember 2022 was not\nmaterial.\n\nOur total credit\nexposure to Ukrainian\ncounterparties or\nborrowers and our\ntotal market exposure\nrelating to Ukrainian\nissuers was not\nmaterial as of\nSeptember 2022.\n\nHigh external funding\nneeds and inconsistent\nmonetary policy have\nled to significant\ndepreciation of the\nTurkish Lira,\nprompting concerns\nabout foreign exchange\nreserves and economic\ninstability. As of\nSeptember 2022, our\ntotal credit exposure\nto Turkey was $2.23\nbillion, substantially\nall of which was to\nnon-sovereign\ncounterparties or\nborrowers. Such\nexposure consisted of\n$948 million related\nto OTC derivatives,\n$157 million related\nto loans and lending\ncommitments and $1.13\nbillion related to\nsecured receivables.\nAfter taking into\nconsideration the\nbenefit of Turkish\ncorporate and\nsovereign collateral,\nand other risk\nmitigants provided by\nTurkish\ncounterparties, our\nnet credit exposure\nwas $940 million. In\naddition, our total\nmarket exposure\nrelating to Turkish\nissuers as of\nSeptember 2022 was\n$(83) million,\nprimarily to sovereign\nissuers. Such exposure\nconsisted of $80\nmillion related to\ndebt, $(245) million\nrelated to credit\nderivatives and $82\nmillion related to\nequities.\n\nIn addition, economic\nand/or political\nuncertainties in\nArgentina, Lebanon,\nVenezuela, Ethiopia\nand Sri Lanka have led\nto concerns about\ntheir financial\nstability.

We manage those\nrisks as follows:\n\nInformation and Cyber\nSecurity Risk.\nInformation and cyber\nsecurity risk is the\nrisk of compromising\nthe confidentiality,\nintegrity or\navailability of our\ndata and systems,\nleading to an adverse\nimpact to us, our\nreputation, our\nclients and/or the\nbroader financial\nsystem. We seek to\nminimize the\noccurrence and impact\nof unauthorized\naccess, disruption or\nuse of information\nand/or information\nsystems. We deploy and\noperate preventive and\ndetective controls and\nprocesses to mitigate\nemerging and evolving\ninformation security\nand cyber security\nthreats, including\nmonitoring our network\nfor known\nvulnerabilities and\nsigns of unauthorized\nattempts to access our\ndata and systems.\nThere is increased\ninformation risk\nthrough\ndiversification of our\ndata across external\nservice providers,\nincluding use of a\nvariety of cloud-\nprovided or -hosted\nservices and\napplications. See\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part\nI, Item 1A of the 2021\nForm 10-K for further\ninformation about\ninformation and cyber\nsecurity risk.\n\nThird-Party Risk.\nThird-party risk,\nincluding vendor risk,\nis the risk of an\nadverse impact due to\nreliance on third\nparties performing\nservices or activities\non our behalf. These\nrisks may include\nlegal, regulatory,\ninformation security,\nreputational,\noperational or any\nother risks inherent\nin engaging a third\nparty. We identify,\nmanage and report key\nthird-party risks and\nconduct due diligence\nacross multiple risk\ndomains, including\ninformation security\nand cyber security,\nresilience and\nadditional third-party\ndependencies. The\nThird-Party Risk\nProgram monitors,\nreviews and reassesses\nthird-party risks on\nan ongoing basis. See\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part\nI, Item 1A of the 2021\nForm 10-K for further\ninformation about\nthird-party risk.\n\nBusiness Resilience\nRisk. Business\nresilience risk is the\nrisk of disruption to\nour critical\nprocesses. We monitor\nthreats and assess\nrisks and seek to\nensure our state of\nreadiness in the event\nof a significant\noperational disruption\nto the normal\noperations of our\ncritical functions or\ntheir dependencies,\nsuch as critical\nfacilities, systems,\nthird parties, data\nand/or personnel. We\napproach business\ncontinuity planning\n(BCP) through the lens\nof business and\noperational\nresilience. The\nresilience framework\ndefines the\nfundamental principles\nfor BCP and crisis\nmanagement to ensure\nthat critical\nfunctions can continue\nto operate in the\nevent of a disruption.\nThe business\ncontinuity program is\ncomprehensive,\nconsistent firmwide\nand up-to-date,\nincorporating new\ninformation,\ntechniques and\ntechnologies as and\nwhen they become\navailable, and our\nresilience recovery\nplans incorporate and\ntest specific and\nmeasurable recovery\ntime objectives in\naccordance with local\nmarket best practices\nand regulatory\nrequirements, and\nunder specific\nscenarios.

Accordingly, we\nhave in place a\ncomprehensive capital\nmanagement policy that\nprovides a framework,\ndefines objectives and\nestablishes guidelines\nto maintain an\nappropriate level and\ncomposition of capital\nin both business-as-\nusual and stressed\nconditions. Our\ncapital management\nframework is designed\nto provide us with the\ninformation needed to\nidentify and\ncomprehensively manage\nrisk, and develop and\napply projected stress\nscenarios that capture\nidiosyncratic\nvulnerabilities with a\ngoal of holding\nsufficient capital to\nremain adequately\ncapitalized even after\nexperiencing a severe\nstress event. See\n\u201cCapital Management\nand Regulatory\nCapital\u201d for further\ninformation about our\ncapital management\nprocess.\n\nWe have established a\ncomprehensive\ngovernance structure\nto manage and oversee\nour day-to-day capital\nmanagement activities\nand to ensure\ncompliance with\ncapital rules and\nrelated policies. Our\ncapital management\nactivities are\noverseen by the Board\nand its committees.\nThe Board is\nresponsible for\napproving our annual\ncapital plan and the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard approves our\ncapital management\npolicy, which details\nthe risk committees\nand members of senior\nmanagement who are\nresponsible for the\nongoing monitoring of\nour capital adequacy\nand evaluation of\ncurrent and future\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, the\nreview of the results\nof our capital\nplanning and stress\ntests processes, and\nthe results of our\ncapital models.

PART II. OTHER\nINFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are\ninvolved in a number of judicial, regulatory\nand arbitration proceedings concerning matters\narising in connection with the conduct of our\nbusinesses. Many of these proceedings are in\nearly stages, and many of these cases seek an\nindeterminate amount of damages. We have\nestimated the upper end of the range of\nreasonably possible aggregate loss for matters\nwhere we have been able to estimate a range\nand we believe, based on currently available\ninformation, that the results of matters where\nwe have not been able to estimate a range of\nreasonably possible loss, in the aggregate,\nwill not have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition, but may be material to\nour operating results in a given period. Given\nthe range of litigation and investigations\npresently under way, our litigation expenses\nmay remain high.
