AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nConsolidation The firm consolidates entities\nin which the firm has a controlling financial\ninterest. The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a\nvoting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)\nthe total equity investment at risk is\nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity\nholders have the power to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the\nentity and the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting\ninterest entity is ownership of a majority\nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest\nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable\nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that\nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a\nvoting interest entity. The firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when\nthe firm has a variable interest or interests\nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive\nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for\nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method\nInvestments. When the firm does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity\nbut can exert significant influence over the\nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair\nvalue by electing the fair value option\navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant\ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns\n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstance common stock. In certain cases, the\nfirm applies the equity method of accounting\nto new investments that are strategic in\nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s\nprincipal business activities, when the firm\nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or\nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less\nsignificant. See Note 8 for further\ninformation about equity-method investments.\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed\ninvestment funds with third-party investors.\nThese funds are typically organized as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies\nfor which the firm acts as general partner or\nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a\nmajority of the economic interests in these\nfunds. These funds are usually voting interest\nentities and generally are not consolidated\nbecause third-party investors typically have\nrights to terminate the funds or to remove the\nfirm as general partner or manager.\nInvestments in these funds are generally\nmeasured at net asset value (NAV) and are\nincluded in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and\n22 for further information about investments\nin funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of\nthese consolidated financial statements\nrequires management to make certain estimates\nand assumptions, the most important of which\nrelate to fair value measurements, the\nallowance for credit losses on loans and\nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,\naccounting for goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, provisions for losses that\nmay arise from litigation and regulatory\nproceedings (including governmental\ninvestigations), and accounting for income\ntaxes. These estimates and assumptions are\nbased on the best available information, but\nactual results could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition Financial Assets and\nLiabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and\nliabilities and certain investments are\ncarried at fair value either under the fair\nvalue option or in accordance with other U.S.\nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to\naccount for certain of its loans and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nby electing the fair value option. The fair\nvalue of a financial instrument is the amount\nthat would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked\nto bid prices and financial liabilities are\nmarked to offer prices. Fair value\nmeasurements do not include transaction costs.\nFair value gains or losses are generally\nincluded in market making or other principal\ntransactions. See Note 4 for further\ninformation about fair value measurements.\n                                              \n  7    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form      \n       10-Q                                   \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Revenues\nfrom contracts with clients represent\napproximately 45% of total non-interest\nrevenues for both the three and nine months\nended September 2023 (including approximately\n85% of investment banking revenues,\napproximately 95% of investment management\nrevenues and all commissions and fees), and\napproximately 45% of total non-interest\nrevenues for the three months ended September\n2022 (including approximately 90% of\ninvestment banking revenues, approximately 95%\nof investment management revenues and all\ncommissions and fees) and approximately 45% of\ntotal non-interest revenues for the nine\nmonths ended September 2022 (including\napproximately 85% of investment banking\nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment\nmanagement revenues and all commissions and\nfees). See Note 25 for information about net\nrevenues by business segment. Investment\nBanking Advisory. Fees from financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues when\nthe services related to the underlying\ntransaction are completed under the terms of\nthe assignment. Non-refundable deposits and\nmilestone payments in connection with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nin revenues upon completion of the underlying\ntransaction or when the assignment is\notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nwhen incurred and are included in transaction\nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such\nexpenses are included in investment banking\nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon\ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses\nassociated with underwriting assignments are\ngenerally deferred until the related revenue\nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise\nconcluded. Such expenses are included in\ntransaction based expenses for completed\nassignments. Investment Management The firm\nearns management fees and incentive fees for\ninvestment management services, which are\nincluded in investment management revenues.\nThe firm makes payments to brokers and\nadvisors related to the placement of the\nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),\nwhich are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily net asset value and are received\nmonthly. Management fees for hedge funds and\nseparately managed accounts are calculated as\na percentage of month-end net asset value and\nare generally received quarterly. Management\nfees for private equity funds are calculated\nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are received quarterly,\nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the\nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.\nDistribution fees paid by the firm are\ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net\nasset value or the committed capital. Such\nfees are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are\ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or\nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other\nperformance target. Incentive fees are\ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a\nfund. Fees that are based on performance over\na twelve-month period are subject to\nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment\nperformance over the life of the fund, future\ninvestment underperformance may require fees\npreviously distributed to the firm to be\nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned\nfrom a fund or separately managed account are\nrecognized when it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal of such fees will not\noccur, which is generally when such fees are\nno longer subject to fluctuations in the\nmarket value of investments held by the fund\nor separately managed account. Therefore,\nincentive fees recognized during the period\nmay relate to performance obligations\nsatisfied in previous periods. Commissions and\nFees The firm earns substantially all\ncommissions and fees from executing and\nclearing client transactions on stock, options\nand futures markets, as well as over-the-\ncounter (OTC) transactions. Commissions and\nfees are recognized on the day the trade is\nexecuted. The firm also provides third-party\nresearch services to clients in connection\nwith certain soft-dollar arrangements. Third-\nparty research costs incurred by the firm in\nconnection with such arrangements are\npresented net within commissions and fees.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form        8  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Revenues associated\nwith remaining performance obligations\nrelating to financial advisory assignments\ncannot be determined until the outcome of the\ntransaction. For the firm\u2019s investment\nmanagement activities, where fees are\ncalculated based on the net asset value of the\nfund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining\nperformance obligations cannot be determined\nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in\nthe market value of investments held by the\nfund or separately managed account. The firm\nis able to determine the future revenues\nassociated with management fees calculated\nbased on committed capital. As of September\n2023, substantially all future net revenues\nassociated with such remaining performance\nobligations will be recognized through 2031.\nAnnual revenues associated with such\nperformance obligations average less than $\n300million through 2031. Transfers of\nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has\nrelinquished control over the assets\ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses\nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or\nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement with transferred\nfinancial assets are initially recognized at\nfair value. For transfers of financial assets\nthat are not accounted for as sales, the\nassets are generally included in trading\nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a\ncollateralized financing, with the related\ninterest expense recognized over the life of\nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about transfers of financial\nassets accounted for as collateralized\nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted\nfor as sales. Cash and Cash Equivalents The\nfirm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid\novernight deposits held in the ordinary course\nof business. Cash and cash equivalents\nincluded cash and due from banks of $\n6.50billion as of September 2023 and $\n7.87billion as of December 2022. Cash and cash\nequivalents also included interest-bearing\ndeposits with banks of $ 233.38billion as of\nSeptember 2023 and $ 233.96billion as of\nDecember 2022. The firm segregates cash for\nregulatory and other purposes related to\nclient activity. Cash and cash equivalents\nsegregated for regulatory and other purposes\nwere $ 17.95billion as of September 2023 and $\n16.94billion as of December 2022. In addition,\nthe firm segregates securities for regulatory\nand other purposes related to client activity.\nSee Note 11 for further information about\nsegregated securities. Customer and Other\nReceivables Customer and other receivables\nincluded receivables from customers and\ncounterparties of $ 90.32billion as of\nSeptember 2023 and $ 67.88billion as of\nDecember 2022, and receivables from brokers,\ndealers and clearing organizations of $\n50.55billion as of September 2023 and $\n67.57billion as of December 2022. Such\nreceivables primarily consist of collateral\nposted in connection with certain derivative\ntransactions, customer margin loans and\nreceivables resulting from unsettled\ntransactions. Substantially all of these\nreceivables are accounted for at amortized\ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,\nwhich generally approximates fair value. As\nthese receivables are not accounted for at\nfair value, they are not included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5.\nHad these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of\nboth September 2023 and December 2022. See\nNote 10 for further information about customer\nand other receivables accounted for at fair\nvalue under the fair value option. Interest on\ncustomer and other receivables is recognized\nover the life of the transaction and included\nin interest income. Customer and other\nreceivables includes receivables from\ncontracts with clients and contract assets.\nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to\nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s\nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n3.45billion as of September 2023 and $\n3.01billion as of December 2022. As of both\nSeptember 2023 and December 2022, contract\nassets were not material.\n                                              \n  9    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form      \n       10-Q                                   \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Such\npayables primarily consist of customer credit\nbalances related to the firm\u2019s prime brokerage\nactivities. Customer and other payables are\naccounted for at cost plus accrued interest,\nwhich generally approximates fair value. As\nthese payables are not accounted for at fair\nvalue, they are not included in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had\nthese payables been included in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy, substantially all would\nhave been classified in level 2 as of both\nSeptember 2023 and December 2022. Interest on\ncustomer and other payables is recognized over\nthe life of the transaction and included in\ninterest expense. Offsetting Assets and\nLiabilities To reduce credit exposures on\nderivatives and securities financing\ntransactions, the firm may enter into master\nnetting agreements or similar arrangements\n(collectively, netting agreements) with\ncounterparties that permit it to offset\nreceivables and payables with such\ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a\ncontract with a counterparty that permits net\nsettlement of multiple transactions with that\ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of\ntermination rights by a non-defaulting party.\nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all\ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is\ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with\nrespect to its derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms\nof the related credit support agreements or\nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit\nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit\nsupport agreement grants the non-defaulting\nparty exercising termination rights the right\nto liquidate the collateral and apply the\nproceeds to any amounts owed. In order to\nassess enforceability of the firm\u2019s right of\nsetoff under netting and credit support\nagreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in\nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the\nagreement. Derivatives are reported on a net-\nby-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for derivative assets and\nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the\nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting\nagreement. Resale agreements and securities\nsold under agreements to repurchase\n(repurchase agreements) and securities\nborrowed and loaned transactions with the same\nsettlement date are presented on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis in the consolidated balance\nsheets when such transactions meet certain\nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements. In the consolidated balance\nsheets, derivatives are reported net of cash\ncollateral received and posted under\nenforceable credit support agreements, when\ntransacted under an enforceable netting\nagreement. In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and\nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not\nreported net of the related cash and\nsecurities received or posted as collateral.\nSee Note 11 for further information about\ncollateral received and pledged, including\nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See\nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about\noffsetting assets and liabilities. Share-Based\nCompensation The cost of employee services\nreceived in exchange for a share-based award\nis generally measured based on the grant-date\nfair value of the award. Share-based awards\nthat do not require future service (i.e.,\nvested awards, including awards granted to\nretirement-eligible employees) are expensed\nimmediately. Share-based awards that require\nfuture service are amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recorded when\nthey occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on\nrestricted stock units (RSUs) are generally\ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that\nrequire future service are forfeited, the\nrelated dividend equivalents originally\ncharged to retained earnings are reclassified\nto compensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues\nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of\nshare-based awards. In limited cases, as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements,\nthe firm may cash settle share-based\ncompensation awards accounted for as equity\ninstruments. For these awards, additional\npaid-in capital is adjusted to the extent of\nthe difference between the value of the award\nat the time of cash settlement and the grant-\ndate value of the award. The tax effects\nrelated to the settlement of share-based\nawards and payments of dividend equivalents\nare recorded in income tax benefit or expense.\nForeign Currency Translation Assets and\nliabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies\nare translated at rates of exchange prevailing\non the date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at\naverage rates of exchange for the period.\nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies\nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a\nnon-U.S. operation, when the functional\ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are\nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive\nincome.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form       10  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value Measurements The fair value\nof a financial instrument is the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid\nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not\ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures\ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active\nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by\nreference to prices for similar instruments,\nquoted prices or recent transactions in less\nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or\nindependently sourced inputs, including, but\nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities,\nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding\nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference\nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower\ncould finance a given financial instrument\nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.\nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for\ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This\nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving\nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based\non the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In\nevaluating the significance of a valuation\ninput, the firm considers, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to\nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as\nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical,\nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.\nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are\nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values\nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial\nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain\nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and\nliabilities may require valuation adjustments\nthat a market participant would require to\narrive at fair value for factors, such as\ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments\nare generally based on market evidence.\nThe table below\npresents financial\nassets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value.\n                                              \n  $

See Note 5 for further\ninformation about significant unobservable\ninputs used to value level 3 financial\ninstruments. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Trading Cash\nInstruments, Investments and Loans Level 1.\nLevel 1 instruments include U.S. government\nobligations, most non-U.S. government\nobligations, certain agency obligations,\ncertain corporate debt instruments, certain\nmoney market instruments and actively traded\nlisted equities. These instruments are valued\nusing quoted prices for identical unrestricted\ninstruments in active markets. The firm\ndefines active markets for equity instruments\nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market\ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm\ndefines active markets for debt instruments\nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity.\nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain\nnon-U.S. government obligations, most agency\nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and\nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,\nmost state and municipal obligations, most\nmoney market instruments, most other debt\nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed\nequities, certain private equities,\ncommodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be\nverified to quoted prices, recent trading\nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative\npricing sources with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency. Consideration is given to\nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor executable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Valuation\nadjustments are typically made to level 2\ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject\nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair\nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally\nbased on market evidence. Level 3. Level 3\ninstruments have one or more significant\nvaluation inputs that are not observable.\nAbsent evidence to the contrary, level 3\ninstruments are initially valued at\ntransaction price, which is considered to be\nthe best initial estimate of fair value.\nSubsequently, the firm uses other\nmethodologies to determine fair value, which\nvary based on the type of instrument.\nValuation inputs and assumptions are changed\nwhen corroborated by substantive observable\nevidence, including values realized on sales.\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments\nvary by instrument, but are generally based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques. The valuation\ntechniques and the nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair values of\neach type of level 3 instrument are described\nbelow: Loans and Securities Backed by\nCommercial Real Estate Loans and securities\nbacked by commercial real estate are directly\nor indirectly collateralized by a single\nproperty or a portfolio of properties, and may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. Significant inputs are\ngenerally determined based on relative value\nanalyses and include: \u2022 Market yields implied\nby transactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and changes in market\nindices, such as the CMBX (an index that\ntracks the performance of commercial mortgage\nbonds); \u2022 Transaction prices in both the\nunderlying collateral and instruments with the\nsame or similar underlying collateral; \u2022 A\nmeasure of expected future cash flows in a\ndefault scenario (recovery rates) implied by\nthe value of the underlying collateral, which\nis mainly driven by current performance of the\nunderlying collateral and capitalization\nrates. Recovery rates are expressed as a\npercentage of notional or face value of the\ninstrument and reflect the benefit of credit\nenhancements on certain instruments; and \u2022\nTiming of expected future cash flows\n(duration) which, in certain cases, may\nincorporate the impact of any loan\nforbearances and other unobservable inputs\n(e.g., prepayment speeds). Loans and\nSecurities Backed by Residential Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by residential\nreal estate are directly or indirectly\ncollateralized by portfolios of residential\nreal estate and may include tranches of\nvarying levels of subordination. Significant\ninputs are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons to instruments with similar\ncollateral and risk profiles. Significant\ninputs include: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets; \u2022\nTransaction prices in both the underlying\ncollateral and instruments with the same or\nsimilar underlying collateral; \u2022 Cumulative\nloss expectations, driven by default rates,\nhome price projections, residential property\nliquidation timelines, related costs and\nsubsequent recoveries; and \u2022 Duration, driven\nby underlying loan prepayment speeds and\nresidential property liquidation timelines.\n                                              \n  13    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks\nthe performance of corporate credit); \u2022\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions\nand, where the firm uses credit default swaps\nto value the related instrument, the cost of\nborrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n\u2022 Duration; and \u2022 Market and transaction\nmultiples for corporate debt instruments with\nconvertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities Equity securities consists\nof private equities. Recent third-party\ncompleted or pending transactions (e.g.,\nmerger proposals, debt restructurings, tender\noffers) are considered the best evidence for\nany change in fair value. When these are not\navailable, the following valuation\nmethodologies are used, as appropriate: \u2022\nIndustry multiples (primarily EBITDA and\nrevenue multiples) and public comparables; \u2022\nTransactions in similar instruments; \u2022\nDiscounted cash flow techniques; and \u2022 Third-\nparty appraisals. The firm also considers\nchanges in the outlook for the relevant\nindustry and financial performance of the\nissuer as compared to projected performance.\nSignificant inputs include: \u2022 Market and\ntransaction multiples; \u2022 Discount rates and\ncapitalization rates; and \u2022 For equity\nsecurities with debt-like features, market\nyields implied by transactions of similar or\nrelated assets, current performance and\nrecovery assumptions, and duration. Other\nTrading Cash Instruments, Investments and\nLoans The significant inputs to the valuation\nof other instruments, such as non-U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations, state and\nmunicipal obligations, and other loans and\ndebt obligations are generally determined\nbased on relative value analyses, which\nincorporate comparisons both to prices of\ncredit default swaps that reference the same\nor similar underlying instrument or entity and\nto other debt instruments for the same issuer\nfor which observable prices or broker\nquotations are available. Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices; \u2022 Current performance and recovery\nassumptions and, where the firm uses credit\ndefault swaps to value the related instrument,\nthe cost of borrowing the underlying reference\nobligation; and \u2022 Duration. Valuation\nTechniques and Significant Inputs for\nDerivatives The firm\u2019s level 2 and level 3\nderivatives are valued using derivative\npricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow\nmodels, correlation models and models that\nincorporate option pricing methodologies, such\nas Monte Carlo simulations). Price\ntransparency of derivatives can generally be\ncharacterized by product type, as described\nbelow. \u2022 Interest Rate. In general, the key\ninputs used to value interest rate derivatives\nare transparent, even for most long-dated\ncontracts. Interest rate swaps and options\ndenominated in the currencies of leading\nindustrialized nations are characterized by\nhigh trading volumes and tight bid/offer\nspreads. Interest rate derivatives that\nreference indices, such as an inflation index,\nor the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year\nswap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) are more\ncomplex, but the key inputs are generally\nobservable. \u2022 Credit. Price transparency for\ncredit default swaps, including both single\nnames and baskets of credits, varies by market\nand underlying reference entity or obligation.\nCredit default swaps that reference indices,\nlarge corporates and major sovereigns\ngenerally exhibit the most price transparency.\nFor credit default swaps with other\nunderliers, price transparency varies based on\ncredit rating, the cost of borrowing the\nunderlying reference obligations, and the\navailability of the underlying reference\nobligations for delivery upon the default of\nthe issuer. Credit default swaps that\nreference loans, asset-backed securities and\nemerging market debt instruments tend to have\nless price transparency than those that\nreference corporate bonds. In addition, more\ncomplex credit derivatives, such as those\nsensitive to the correlation between two or\nmore underlying reference obligations,\ngenerally have less price transparency.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form       14  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\n\u2022 Currency. Prices for currency derivatives\nbased on the exchange rates of leading\nindustrialized nations, including those with\nlonger tenors, are generally transparent. The\nprimary difference between the price\ntransparency of developed and emerging market\ncurrency derivatives is that emerging markets\ntend to be only observable for contracts with\nshorter tenors. \u2022 Commodity. Commodity\nderivatives include transactions referenced to\nenergy (e.g., oil, natural gas and\nelectricity), metals (e.g., precious and base)\nand soft commodities (e.g., agricultural).\nPrice transparency varies based on the\nunderlying commodity, delivery location, tenor\nand product quality (e.g., diesel fuel\ncompared to unleaded gasoline). In general,\nprice transparency for commodity derivatives\nis greater for contracts with shorter tenors\nand contracts that are more closely aligned\nwith major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n\u2022 Equity. Price transparency for equity\nderivatives varies by market and underlier.\nOptions on indices and the common stock of\ncorporates included in major equity indices\nexhibit the most price transparency. Equity\nderivatives generally have observable market\nprices, except for contracts with long tenors\nor reference prices that differ significantly\nfrom current market prices. More complex\nequity derivatives, such as those sensitive to\nthe correlation between two or more individual\nstocks, generally have less price\ntransparency. Liquidity is essential to the\nobservability of all product types. If\ntransaction volumes decline, previously\ntransparent prices and other inputs may become\nunobservable. Conversely, even highly\nstructured products may at times have trading\nvolumes large enough to provide observability\nof prices and other inputs. Level 1. Level 1\nderivatives include short-term contracts for\nfuture delivery of securities when the\nunderlying security is a level 1 instrument,\nand exchange-traded derivatives if they are\nactively traded and are valued at their quoted\nmarket price. Level 2. Level 2 derivatives\ninclude OTC derivatives for which all\nsignificant valuation inputs are corroborated\nby market evidence and exchange-traded\nderivatives that are not actively traded\nand/or that are valued using models that\ncalibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC\nderivatives. The selection of a particular\nmodel to value a derivative depends on the\ncontractual terms of and specific risks\ninherent in the instrument, as well as the\navailability of pricing information in the\nmarket. For derivatives that trade in liquid\nmarkets, model selection does not involve\nsignificant management judgment because\noutputs of models can be calibrated to market-\nclearing levels. Valuation models require a\nvariety of inputs, such as contractual terms,\nmarket prices, yield curves, discount rates\n(including those derived from interest rates\non collateral received and posted as specified\nin credit support agreements for\ncollateralized derivatives), credit curves,\nmeasures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss\nseverity rates and correlations of such\ninputs. Significant inputs to the valuations\nof level 2 derivatives can be verified to\nmarket transactions, broker or dealer\nquotations or other alternative pricing\nsources with reasonable levels of price\ntransparency. Consideration is given to the\nnature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or\nexecutable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Level 3 . Level 3\nderivatives are valued using models which\nutilize observable level 1 and/or level 2\ninputs, as well as unobservable level 3\ninputs. The significant unobservable inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s level 3 derivatives\nare described below. \u2022 For level 3 interest\nrate and currency derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include correlations of\ncertain currencies and interest rates (e.g.,\nthe correlation between Euro inflation and\nEuro interest rates) and specific interest\nrate and currency volatilities. \u2022 For level 3\ncredit derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs include illiquid credit spreads and\nupfront credit points, which are unique to\nspecific reference obligations and reference\nentities, and recovery rates. \u2022 For level 3\ncommodity derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include volatilities for\noptions with strike prices that differ\nsignificantly from current market prices and\nprices or spreads for certain products for\nwhich the product quality or physical location\nof the commodity is not aligned with benchmark\nindices. \u2022 For level 3 equity derivatives,\nsignificant unobservable inputs generally\ninclude equity volatility inputs for options\nthat are long-dated and/or have strike prices\nthat differ significantly from current market\nprices. In addition, the valuation of certain\nstructured trades requires the use of level 3\ncorrelation inputs, such as the correlation of\nthe price performance of two or more\nindividual stocks or the correlation of the\nprice performance for a basket of stocks to\nanother asset class, such as commodities.\n                                              \n  15    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Level 3 inputs are\nchanged when corroborated by evidence, such as\nsimilar market transactions, third-party\npricing services and/or broker or dealer\nquotations or other empirical market data. In\ncircumstances where the firm cannot verify the\nmodel value by reference to market\ntransactions, it is possible that a different\nvaluation model could produce a materially\ndifferent estimate of fair value. See Note 5\nfor further information about significant\nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of\nlevel 3 derivatives. Valuation Adjustments.\nValuation adjustments are integral to\ndetermining the fair value of derivative\nportfolios and are used to adjust the mid-\nmarket valuations produced by derivative\npricing models to the exit price valuation.\nThese adjustments incorporate bid/offer\nspreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and\nfunding valuation adjustments, which account\nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in\nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative\nportfolios. The firm also makes funding\nvaluation adjustments to collateralized\nderivatives where the terms of the agreement\ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge\ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are\ngenerally used when calibrating valuation\nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In\naddition, for derivatives that include\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm\nmakes model or exit price adjustments to\naccount for the valuation uncertainty present\nin the transaction. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Other Financial Assets\nand Liabilities at Fair Value In addition to\ntrading cash instruments, derivatives, and\ncertain investments and loans, the firm\naccounts for certain of its other financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value under the\nfair value option. Such instruments include\nrepurchase agreements and substantially all\nresale agreements; certain securities borrowed\nand loaned transactions; certain customer and\nother receivables, including certain margin\nloans; certain time deposits, including\nstructured certificates of deposit, which are\nhybrid financial instruments; substantially\nall other secured financings, including\ntransfers of assets accounted for as\nfinancings; certain unsecured short- and long-\nterm borrowings, substantially all of which\nare hybrid financial instruments; and certain\nother assets and liabilities. These\ninstruments are generally valued based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques, which\nincorporate inputs with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency, and are generally\nclassified in level 2 because the inputs are\nobservable. Valuation adjustments may be made\nfor liquidity and for counterparty and the\nfirm\u2019s credit quality. The significant inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s other financial\nassets and liabilities are described below.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements and\nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of resale\nand repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and interest rates. Customer and Other\nReceivables. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of receivables are interest rates,\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and funding spreads. Deposits. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of time\ndeposits are interest rates and the amount and\ntiming of future cash flows. The inputs used\nto value the embedded derivative component of\nhybrid financial instruments are consistent\nwith the inputs used to value the firm\u2019s other\nderivative instruments described above. See\nNote 7 for further information about\nderivatives and Note 13 for further\ninformation about deposits. Other Secured\nFinancings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other secured financings are the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, funding spreads and the\nfair value of the collateral delivered by the\nfirm (determined using the amount and timing\nof expected future cash flows, market prices,\nmarket yields and recovery assumptions). See\nNote 11 for further information about other\nsecured financings. Unsecured Short- and Long-\nTerm Borrowings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of unsecured short- and long-term\nborrowings are the amount and timing of\nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,\nthe credit spreads of the firm and commodity\nprices for prepaid commodity transactions. The\ninputs used to value the embedded derivative\ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are\nconsistent with the inputs used to value the\nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described\nabove.

Derivatives\nmay be traded on an\nexchange (exchange-\ntraded) or they may be\nprivately negotiated\ncontracts, which are\nusually referred to as\nOTC derivatives.\nCertain of the firm\u2019s\nOTC derivatives are\ncleared and settled\nthrough central\nclearing\ncounterparties (OTC-\ncleared), while others\nare bilateral\ncontracts between two\ncounterparties\n(bilateral OTC).\nMarket Making. As a\nmarket maker, the firm\nenters into derivative\ntransactions to\nprovide liquidity to\nclients and to\nfacilitate the\ntransfer and hedging\nof their risks. In\nthis role, the firm\ntypically acts as\nprincipal and is\nrequired to commit\ncapital to provide\nexecution, and\nmaintains market-\nmaking positions in\nresponse to, or in\nanticipation of,\nclient demand. Risk\nManagement. The firm\nalso enters into\nderivatives to\nactively manage risk\nexposures that arise\nfrom its market-making\nand investing and\nfinancing activities.\nThe firm\u2019s holdings\nand exposures are\nhedged, in many cases,\non either a portfolio\nor risk-specific\nbasis, as opposed to\nan instrument-by-\ninstrument basis. The\noffsetting impact of\nthis economic hedging\nis reflected in the\nsame business segment\nas the related\nrevenues. In addition,\nthe firm may enter\ninto derivatives\ndesignated as hedges\nunder U.S. GAAP. These\nderivatives are used\nto manage interest\nrate exposure of\ncertain fixed-rate\nunsecured borrowings\nand deposits and\ncertain U.S. and\nnon-U.S. government\nsecurities classified\nas available-for-sale,\nforeign exchange risk\nof certain available-\nfor-sale securities\nand the net investment\nin certain non-U.S.\noperations.\n\nThe firm enters into\nvarious types of\nderivatives,\nincluding: \u2022 Futures\nand Forwards.\nContracts that commit\ncounterparties to\npurchase or sell\nfinancial instruments,\ncommodities or\ncurrencies in the\nfuture. \u2022 Swaps.\nContracts that require\ncounterparties to\nexchange cash flows,\nsuch as currency or\ninterest payment\nstreams. The amounts\nexchanged are based on\nthe specific terms of\nthe contract with\nreference to specified\nrates, financial\ninstruments,\ncommodities,\ncurrencies or indices.\n\u2022 Options. Contracts\nin which the option\npurchaser has the\nright, but not the\nobligation, to\npurchase from or sell\nto the option writer\nfinancial instruments,\ncommodities or\ncurrencies within a\ndefined time period\nfor a specified price.\nDerivatives are\nreported on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for\nderivative assets and\nliabilities for a\ngiven counterparty)\nwhen a legal right of\nsetoff exists under an\nenforceable netting\nagreement\n(counterparty\nnetting). Derivatives\nare accounted for at\nfair value, net of\ncash collateral\nreceived or posted\nunder enforceable\ncredit support\nagreements (cash\ncollateral netting).\nDerivative assets are\nincluded in trading\nassetsand derivative\nliabilities are\nincluded in trading\nliabilities.

Credit\nDerivatives The firm\nenters into a broad\narray of credit\nderivatives to\nfacilitate client\ntransactions and to\nmanage the credit risk\nassociated with\nmarket-making and\ninvesting and\nfinancing activities.\nCredit derivatives are\nactively managed based\non the firm\u2019s net risk\nposition. Credit\nderivatives are\ngenerally individually\nnegotiated contracts\nand can have various\nsettlement and payment\nconventions. Credit\nevents include failure\nto pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of\nindebtedness,\nrestructuring,\nrepudiation and\ndissolution of the\nreference entity. The\nfirm enters into the\nfollowing types of\ncredit derivatives: \u2022\nCredit Default Swaps.\nSingle-name credit\ndefault swaps protect\nthe buyer against the\nloss of principal on\none or more bonds,\nloans or mortgages\n(reference\nobligations) in the\nevent the issuer of\nthe reference\nobligations suffers a\ncredit event. The\nbuyer of protection\npays an initial or\nperiodic premium to\nthe seller and\nreceives protection\nfor the period of the\ncontract. If there is\nno credit event, as\ndefined in the\ncontract, the seller\nof protection makes no\npayments to the buyer.\nIf a credit event\noccurs, the seller of\nprotection is required\nto make a payment to\nthe buyer, calculated\naccording to the terms\nof the contract. \u2022\nCredit Options. In a\ncredit option, the\noption writer assumes\nthe obligation to\npurchase or sell a\nreference obligation\nat a specified price\nor credit spread. The\noption purchaser buys\nthe right, but does\nnot assume the\nobligation, to sell\nthe reference\nobligation to, or\npurchase it from, the\noption writer. The\npayments on credit\noptions depend either\non a particular credit\nspread or the price of\nthe reference\nobligation.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form       36  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

If\na credit event occurs\nin one of the\nunderlying reference\nobligations, the\nprotection seller pays\nthe protection buyer.\nThe payment is\ntypically a pro-rata\nportion of the\ntransaction\u2019s total\nnotional amount based\non the underlying\ndefaulted reference\nobligation. In certain\ntransactions, the\ncredit risk of a\nbasket or index is\nseparated into various\nportions (tranches),\neach having different\nlevels of\nsubordination. The\nmost junior tranches\ncover initial defaults\nand once losses exceed\nthe notional amount of\nthese junior tranches,\nany excess loss is\ncovered by the next\nmost senior tranche. \u2022\nTotal Return Swaps. A\ntotal return swap\ntransfers the risks\nrelating to economic\nperformance of a\nreference obligation\nfrom the protection\nbuyer to the\nprotection seller.\nTypically, the\nprotection buyer\nreceives a floating\nrate of interest and\nprotection against any\nreduction in fair\nvalue of the reference\nobligation, and the\nprotection seller\nreceives the cash\nflows associated with\nthe reference\nobligation, plus any\nincrease in the fair\nvalue of the reference\nobligation. The firm\neconomically hedges\nits exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a\nparticular written\ncredit derivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default. As\nof September 2023,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n565.33billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n632.41billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 67.08billion. As\nof December 2022,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n528.31billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n579.14billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 50.83billion.

The following is a description\nof the loan types in the table above: \u2022\nCorporate. Corporate loans includes term\nloans, revolving lines of credit, letter of\ncredit facilities and bridge loans, and are\nprincipally used for operating and general\ncorporate purposes, or in connection with\nacquisitions. Corporate loans are secured\n(typically by a senior lien on the assets of\nthe borrower) or unsecured, depending on the\nloan purpose, the risk profile of the borrower\nand other factors. \u2022 Commercial Real Estate.\nCommercial real estate loans includes\noriginated loans that are directly or\nindirectly secured by hotels, retail stores,\nmultifamily housing complexes and commercial\nand industrial properties. Commercial real\nestate loans also includes loans extended to\nclients who warehouse assets that are directly\nor indirectly backed by commercial real\nestate. In addition, commercial real estate\nincludes loans purchased by the firm. \u2022\nResidential Real Estate. Residential real\nestate loans primarily includes loans extended\nto wealth management clients and to clients\nwho warehouse assets that are directly or\nindirectly secured by residential real estate.\nIn addition, residential real estate includes\nloans purchased by the firm. \u2022 Securities-\nBased. Securities-based loans includes loans\nthat are secured by stocks, bonds, mutual\nfunds, and exchange-traded funds. These loans\nare primarily extended to the firm's wealth\nmanagement clients and used for purposes other\nthan purchasing, carrying or trading margin\nstocks. Securities-based loans require\nborrowers to post additional collateral based\non changes in the underlying collateral's fair\nvalue. \u2022 Other Collateralized. Other\ncollateralized loans includes loans that are\nbacked by specific collateral (other than\nsecurities and real estate). Such loans are\nextended to clients who warehouse assets that\nare directly or indirectly secured by\ncorporate loans, consumer loans and other\nassets. Other collateralized loans also\nincludes loans to investment funds (managed by\nthird parties) that are collateralized by\ncapital commitments of the funds' investors or\nassets held by the fund, as well as other\nsecured loans extended to the firm's wealth\nmanagement clients. \u2022 Installment. Installment\nloans are unsecured loans originated by the\nfirm. \u2022 Credit Cards. Credit card loans are\nloans made pursuant to revolving lines of\ncredit issued to consumers by the firm. \u2022\nOther. Other loans includes unsecured loans\nextended to wealth management clients and\nunsecured consumer and credit card loans\npurchased by the firm. See Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s fair value measurement\npolicies, valuation techniques and significant\ninputs used to determine the fair value of\nloans, and Note 5 for information about loans\nwithin the fair value hierarchy. Credit\nQuality Risk Assessment. The firm\u2019s risk\nassessment process includes evaluating the\ncredit quality of its loans by the firm\u2019s\nindependent risk oversight and control\nfunction. For corporate loans and a majority\nof securities-based, real estate, other\ncollateralized and other loans, the firm\nperforms credit analyses which incorporate\ninitial and ongoing evaluations of the\ncapacity and willingness of a borrower to meet\nits financial obligations. These credit\nevaluations are performed on an annual basis\nor more frequently if deemed necessary as a\nresult of events or changes in circumstances.\nThe firm determines an internal credit rating\nfor the borrower by considering the results of\nthe credit evaluations and assumptions with\nrespect to the nature of and outlook for the\nborrower\u2019s industry and the economic\nenvironment. Beginning in the first quarter of\n2023, the firm also takes into consideration\ncollateral received or other credit support\narrangements when determining an internal\ncredit rating on collateralized loans, as\nmanagement believes that this methodology\nbetter reflects the credit quality of the\nunderlying loans. In the table below, prior\nperiod amounts have been conformed to reflect\nthe current methodology. The impact to\nDecember 2022 was an increase in loans\nclassified as investment-grade and a decrease\nin loans classified as non-investment-grade of\n$ 25.0billion in real estate (warehouse loans)\nand other collateralized loans. For consumer\nloans and for loans that are not assigned an\ninternal credit rating, the firm reviews\ncertain key metrics, including, but not\nlimited to, the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO)\ncredit scores, delinquency status, collateral\nvalue and other risk factors.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form       44  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

when\nit is probable that\nthe firm will not\ncollect all principal\nand interest due under\nthe contractual terms,\nregardless of the\ndelinquency status or\nif a loan is past due\nfor 90 days or more,\nunless the loan is\nboth well\ncollateralized and in\nthe process of\ncollection. At that\ntime, all accrued but\nuncollected interest\nis reversed against\ninterest income and\ninterest subsequently\ncollected is\nrecognized on a cash\nbasis to the extent\nthe loan balance is\ndeemed collectible.\nOtherwise, all cash\nreceived is used to\nreduce the outstanding\nloan balance. A loan\nis considered past due\nwhen a principal or\ninterest payment has\nnot been made\naccording to its\ncontractual terms.\nCredit card loans are\nnot placed on\nnonaccrual status and\naccrue interest until\nthe loan is paid in\nfull or is charged\noff.\nThe table below presents information about\npast due loans.\n                                              \n  $                                           \n  in                                          \n  m\u2026                                          \n  As                         90               \n  of                         da\u2026              \n  S\u2026            30\u2026          or               \n  2\u2026            da\u2026          mo\u2026          T\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026    $    \u2013       $   80       $   80      \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026       295          543          838      \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026         1            5            6      \n  e\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026         1            \u2013            1      \n  O\u2026        33           63           96      \n  c\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026         8            6           14      \n  C\u2026       423          424          847      \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026         7           11           18      \n  T\u2026    $  768       $  1,\u2026       $  1,\u2026      \n  T\u2026                                          \n  d\u2026                                          \n  by                                          \n  g\u2026                                 1.1  %   \n  l\u2026                                          \n  at                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026                                          \n  As                                          \n  of                                          \n  D\u2026                                          \n  2\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026    $    \u2013       $   92       $   92      \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026        47          362          409      \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026         4            6           10      \n  e\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026         1            \u2013            1      \n  O\u2026        10            5           15      \n  c\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026        46           17           63      \n  C\u2026       291          265          556      \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026        17            5           22      \n  T\u2026    $  416       $  752       $  1,\u2026      \n  T\u2026                                          \n  d\u2026                                          \n  by                                          \n  g\u2026                                 0.7  %   \n  l\u2026                                          \n  at                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  47    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In certain\ncircumstances, the\nfirm may modify the\noriginal terms of a\nloan agreement by\ngranting a concession\nto a borrower\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulty, typically\nin the form of a\nmodification of loan\ncovenants, but may\nalso include\nforbearance of\ninterest or principal,\npayment extensions or\ninterest rate\nreductions. These\nmodifications, to the\nextent significant,\nwere considered TDRs\nas of December 2022.\nIn January 2023, the\nfirm adopted ASU No.\n2022-02, which\neliminated the\nrecognition and\nmeasurement guidance\nfor TDRs and requires\nenhanced disclosures\nfor certain loan\nmodifications. As of\nDecember 2022, loans\nmodified in a TDR were\n$ 231million and\ncommitments related to\nsuch loans were not\nmaterial.\nSubstantially all of\nsuch loans modified in\na TDR were related to\ncorporate and\ncommercial real estate\nloans. During both the\nthree and nine months\nended September 2023,\nthe firm provided loan\nmodifications (in the\nform of term\nextensions) to\nborrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty.\nAs of September 2023,\nthe carrying value of\nloans modified during\nthe three months ended\nSeptember 2023 was $\n172million and the\ncarrying value of\nloans modified during\nthe nine months ended\nSeptember 2023 was $\n755million. Lending\ncommitments related to\nsuch loans were not\nmaterial and such loan\nmodifications were\nprimarily related to\ncorporate and\ncommercial real estate\nloans. The impact of\nthese modifications\nwas not material for\neither the three or\nnine months ended\nSeptember 2023. During\nthe nine months ended\nSeptember 2023, the\nfirm charged-off\napproximately $\n100million of loans\nthat had defaulted\nafter being modified.\nSubstantially all of\nthe remaining modified\nloans were performing\nin accordance with the\nmodified contractual\nterms as of September\n2023.\n\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses The firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit\nlosses consists of the\nallowance for losses\non loans and lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at amortized cost.\nLoans and lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at fair value or\naccounted for at the\nlower of cost or fair\nvalue are not subject\nto an allowance for\ncredit losses. To\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, the firm\nclassifies its loans\nand lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at amortized cost\ninto wholesale and\nconsumer portfolios.\nThese portfolios\nrepresent the level at\nwhich the firm has\ndeveloped and\ndocumented its\nmethodology to\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. The allowance\nfor credit losses is\nmeasured on a\ncollective basis for\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics using\na modeled approach and\non an asset-specific\nbasis for loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses takes\ninto account the\nweighted average of a\nrange of forecasts of\nfuture economic\nconditions over the\nexpected life of the\nloan and lending\ncommitments. The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios described\nbelow. The firm\napplies judgment in\nweighing individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including the\nfirm\u2019s internally\nderived economic\noutlook, market\nconsensus, recent\nmacroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses also includes\nqualitative components\nwhich allow management\nto reflect the\nuncertain nature of\neconomic forecasting,\ncapture uncertainty\nregarding model\ninputs, and account\nfor model imprecision\nand concentration\nrisk.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form       48  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The allowance for credit losses on\nthese loans was $ 708million as of September\n2023 and $ 535million as of December 2022.\nThese loans included $ 922million as of\nSeptember 2023 and $ 384million as of December\n2022 of loans which did not require a reserve\nas the loan was deemed to be recoverable.\nSee Note 18 for\nfurther information\nabout lending\ncommitments.\n\nThe following is a\ndescription of the\nmethodology used to\ncalculate the\nallowance for credit\nlosses: Wholesale. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for wholesale\nloans and lending\ncommitments that\nexhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics is\nmeasured using a\nmodeled approach.\nThese models determine\nthe probability of\ndefault and loss given\ndefault based on\nvarious risk factors,\nincluding internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators, the\nborrower\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial\nobligations, the\nborrower\u2019s country of\nrisk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. For\nlending commitments,\nthe methodology also\nconsiders the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding.\nIn addition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nthe loan-to-value\nratio, debt service\nratio and home price\nindex. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nwholesale loans and\nlending commitments\ninclude unemployment\nrates, GDP, credit\nspreads, commercial\nand industrial\ndelinquency rates,\nshort- and long-term\ninterest rates, and\noil prices. The\nallowance for loan\nlosses for wholesale\nloans that do not\nshare similar risk\ncharacteristics, such\nas nonaccrual loans,\nis calculated using\nthe present value of\nexpected future cash\nflows discounted at\nthe loan\u2019s effective\nrate, the observable\nmarket price of the\nloan or the fair value\nof the collateral.\nWholesale loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\nConsumer. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for consumer\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics is\ncalculated using a\nmodeled approach which\nclassifies consumer\nloans into pools based\non borrower-related\nand exposure-related\ncharacteristics that\ndifferentiate a pool\u2019s\nrisk characteristics\nfrom other pools. The\nfactors considered in\ndetermining a pool are\ngenerally consistent\nwith the risk\ncharacteristics used\nfor internal credit\nrisk measurement and\nmanagement and include\nkey metrics, such as\nFICO credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nconsumer loans include\nunemployment rates and\ndelinquency rates. The\nexpected life of\nrevolving credit card\nloans is determined by\nmodeling expected\nfuture draws and the\ntiming and amount of\nrepayments allocated\nto the funded balance.\nThe firm also\nrecognizes an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on commitments\nto acquire loans.\nHowever, no allowance\nfor credit losses is\nrecognized on credit\ncard lending\ncommitments as they\nare cancellable by the\nfirm. Installment\nloans are charged off\nwhen they are 120 days\npast due. Credit card\nloans are charged off\nwhen they are 180 days\npast due.\n                                              \n  49    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

If the\nfirm elects to\nbifurcate the embedded\nderivative from the\nassociated debt, the\nderivative is\naccounted for at fair\nvalue and the host\ncontract is accounted\nfor at amortized cost,\nadjusted for the\neffective portion of\nany fair value hedges.\nIf the firm does not\nelect to bifurcate,\nthe entire hybrid\nfinancial instrument\nis accounted for at\nfair value under the\nfair value option.\n                                              \n  51    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See\nNote 18 for further\ninformation about\nlending commitments.\n\nImpact of Credit\nSpreads on Loans and\nLending Commitments\nThe estimated net gain/(loss) attributable to\nchanges in instrument-specific credit spreads\non loans and lending commitments for which the\nfair value option was elected was $( 118)\nmillion for the three months ended September\n2023, $( 75) million for the three months\nended September 2022, $( 170) million for the\nnine months ended September 2023 and $( 182)\nmillion for the nine months ended September\n2022. The firm generally calculates the fair\nvalue of loans and lending commitments for\nwhich the fair value option is elected by\ndiscounting future cash flows at a rate which\nincorporates the instrument-specific credit\nspreads. For floating-rate loans and lending\ncommitments, substantially all changes in fair\nvalue are attributable to changes in\ninstrument-specific credit spreads, whereas\nfor fixed-rate loans and lending commitments,\nchanges in fair value are also attributable to\nchanges in interest rates.\n\nNote 11. Collateralized Agreements and\nFinancings Collateralized agreements are\nresale agreements and securities borrowed.\nCollateralized financings are repurchase\nagreements, securities loaned and other\nsecured financings. The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things,\nfacilitate client activities, invest excess\ncash, acquire securities to cover short\npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings with\nthe same settlement date are presented on a\nnet-by-counterparty basis when such\ntransactions meet certain settlement criteria\nand are subject to netting agreements.\nInterest on collateralized agreements, which\nis included in interest income, and\ncollateralized financings, which is included\nin interest expense, is recognized over the\nlife of the transaction. See Note 23 for\nfurther information about interest income and\ninterest expense. Resale and Repurchase\nAgreements A resale agreement is a transaction\nin which the firm purchases financial\ninstruments from a seller, typically in\nexchange for cash, and simultaneously enters\ninto an agreement to resell the same or\nsubstantially the same financial instruments\nto the seller at a stated price plus accrued\ninterest at a future date. A repurchase\nagreement is a transaction in which the firm\nsells financial instruments to a buyer,\ntypically in exchange for cash, and\nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same\nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a\nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale\nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d) involve the legal transfer of\nownership of financial instruments, they are\naccounted for as financing arrangements\nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the\nmaturity of the agreement. The financial\ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and\nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations, and\ninvestment-grade sovereign obligations. The\nfirm receives financial instruments purchased\nunder resale agreements and makes delivery of\nfinancial instruments sold under repurchase\nagreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the\nfirm monitors the market value of these\nfinancial instruments on a daily basis, and\ndelivers or obtains additional collateral due\nto changes in the market value of the\nfinancial instruments, as appropriate. For\nresale agreements, the firm typically requires\ncollateral with a fair value approximately\nequal to the carrying value of the relevant\nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n                                              \n  53    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

When the\nfirm returns the\nsecurities, the\ncounterparty returns\nthe cash or\nsecurities. Interest\nis generally paid\nperiodically over the\nlife of the\ntransaction. In a\nsecurities loaned\ntransaction, the firm\nlends securities to a\ncounterparty in\nexchange for cash or\nsecurities. When the\ncounterparty returns\nthe securities, the\nfirm returns the cash\nor securities posted\nas collateral.\nInterest is generally\npaid periodically over\nthe life of the\ntransaction. The firm\nreceives securities\nborrowed and makes\ndelivery of securities\nloaned. To mitigate\ncredit exposure, the\nfirm monitors the\nmarket value of these\nsecurities on a daily\nbasis, and delivers or\nobtains additional\ncollateral due to\nchanges in the market\nvalue of the\nsecurities, as\nappropriate. For\nsecurities borrowed\ntransactions, the firm\ntypically requires\ncollateral with a fair\nvalue approximately\nequal to the carrying\nvalue of the\nsecurities borrowed\ntransaction.\nSecurities borrowed\nand loaned within FICC\nfinancing are recorded\nat fair value under\nthe fair value option.\nSee Note 5 for further\ninformation about\nsecurities borrowed\nand loaned accounted\nfor at fair value.\nSubstantially all of\nthe securities\nborrowed and loaned\nwithin Equities\nfinancing are recorded\nbased on the amount of\ncash collateral\nadvanced or received\nplus accrued interest.\nThe firm also reviews\nsuch securities\nborrowed to determine\nif an allowance for\ncredit losses should\nbe recorded by taking\ninto consideration the\nfair value of\ncollateral received.\nAs these agreements\ngenerally can be\nterminated on demand,\nthey exhibit little,\nif any, sensitivity to\nchanges in interest\nrates.

See Note\n10 for further\ninformation about\nother secured\nfinancings that are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue. Other secured\nfinancings that are\nnot recorded at fair\nvalue are recorded\nbased on the amount of\ncash received plus\naccrued interest,\nwhich generally\napproximates fair\nvalue. As these\nfinancings are not\naccounted for at fair\nvalue, they are not\nincluded in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy\nin Notes 4 and 5.

During the first quarter\nof 2023, goodwill for Consumer platforms\nincreased by $ 22million as a result of an\nupdated purchase price allocation related to\nthe GreenSky acquisition. During the second\nquarter of 2023, in connection with the\nexploration of a potential sale of GreenSky,\nthe firm performed a quantitative goodwill\ntest and determined that the goodwill\nassociated with Consumer platforms was\nimpaired, and accordingly, recorded a $\n504million impairment.\n\u2022 During 2022, goodwill incr eased by $\n2.09billion, substantially all in connection\nwith the acquisitions of GreenSky and NN\nInvestment Partners (NNIP).\n\u2022 Wealth management included $ 35million of\ngoodwill as of September 2023 that was\nclassified as held for sale in connection with\nthe planned sale of PFM.\nGoodwill is assessed\nfor impairment\nannually in the fourth\nquarter or more\nfrequently if events\noccur or circumstances\nchange that indicate\nan impairment may\nexist. When assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its carrying\nvalue. If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment.\n\nThe quantitative\ngoodwill test compares\nthe estimated fair\nvalue of each\nreporting unit with\nits carrying value\n(including goodwill\nand identifiable\nintangible assets). If\nthe reporting unit\u2019s\nestimated fair value\nexceeds its carrying\nvalue, goodwill is not\nimpaired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated fair value\nof a reporting unit is\nless than its carrying\nvalue and any such\nimpairment is included\nin depreciation and\namortization. In the\nfourth quarter of\n2022, goodwill was\ntested for impairment\nusing a quantitative\ntest. The estimated\nfair value of each of\nthe reporting units\nexceeded its\nrespective carrying\nvalue, and therefore,\ngoodwill was not\nimpaired. The\nestimated fair value\nof each reporting unit\nwas based on valuation\ntechniques the firm\nbelieves market\nparticipants would use\nto value these\nreporting units.\nEstimated fair values\nare generally derived\nfrom utilizing a\nrelative value\ntechnique, which\napplies observable\nprice-to-earnings\nmultiples or price-to-\nbook multiples of\ncomparable competitors\nto the reporting\nunits\u2019 net earnings or\nnet book value, or a\ndiscounted cash flow\nvaluation approach,\nfor reporting units\nwith businesses in\nearly stages of\ndevelopment. The\ncarrying value of each\nreporting unit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nBased on the\nevaluation of relevant\nfactors during the\nfirst nine months of\n2023, other than the\nimpairment noted\nabove, the firm\ndetermined that it was\nmore likely than not\nthat the estimated\nfair value of each of\nthe reporting units\nexceeded its\nrespective carrying\nvalue as of September\n2023.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form       58  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

An\noperating lease right-\nof-use asset is\ninitially determined\nbased on the operating\nlease liability,\nadjusted for initial\ndirect costs, lease\nincentives and amounts\npaid at or prior to\nlease commencement.\nThis amount is then\namortized over the\nlease term.Right-of-\nuse assets and\noperating lease\nliabilities recognized\n(in non-cash\ntransactions for\nleases entered into or\nassumed) by the firm\nwere $ 225million for\nthe three months ended\nSeptember 2023, $\n52million for the\nthree months ended\nSeptember 2022, $\n306million for the\nnine months ended\nSeptember 2023 and $\n168million for the\nnine months ended\nSeptember 2022. See\nNote 15 for\ninformation about\noperating lease\nliabilities. For\nleases where the firm\nwill derive no\neconomic benefit from\nleased space that it\nhas vacated or where\nthe firm has shortened\nthe term of a lease\nwhen space is no\nlonger needed, the\nfirm will record an\nimpairment or\naccelerated\namortization of right-\nof-use assets.There\nwere no material\nimpairments or\naccelerated\namortizations during\neach of the three and\nnine months ended\nSeptember 2023 or\nSeptember 2022.\nMiscellaneous\nReceivables and Other\nMiscellaneous\nreceivables and other\nincluded: \u2022\nInvestments in\nqualified affordable\nhousing projects of $\n1.42billion as of\nSeptember 2023 and $\n793million as of\nDecember 2022. The\nfirm accounts for\nthese investments\nusing the proportional\namortization method\nsuch that the\ninvestment is\namortized in\nproportion to the\nincome tax credits\nreceived on such\ninvestments. The\namortization of\ninvestments and the\nrelated income tax\ncredit are recorded as\na component of the\nprovision for taxes.\nDuring the nine months\nended September 2023,\nthe firm recognized\namortization of $\n210million and related\nincome tax credits of\n$ 257million, and\nduring the nine months\nended September 2022,\nthe firm recognized\namortization of $\n88million and related\nincome tax credits of\n$ 117million. The\namortization and the\nrelated tax credits\nwere not material for\neither the three\nmonths ended September\n2023 or September\n2022.\n\n\u2022 Assets classified as\nheld for sale were $\n1.68billion as of\nSeptember 2023 and $\n285million as of\nDecember 2022.

The\nfirm pays interest semi-annually on the junior\nsubordinated debt at an annual rate of 6.345%\nand the debt matures on February 15, 2034. The\ncoupon rate and the payment dates applicable\nto the beneficial interests are the same as\nthe interest rate and payment dates for the\njunior subordinated debt. The firm has the\nright, from time to time, to defer payment of\ninterest on the junior subordinated debt, and\ntherefore cause payment on Goldman Sachs\nCapital I\u2019s preferred beneficial interests to\nbe deferred, in each case up to ten\nconsecutive semi-annual periods.

Securitization Activities The firm\nsecuritizes residential and commercial\nmortgages, corporate bonds, loans and other\ntypes of financial assets by selling these\nassets to securitization vehicles (e.g.,\ntrusts, corporate entities and limited\nliability companies) or through a\nresecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter\nof the beneficial interests that are sold to\ninvestors. The firm\u2019s residential mortgage\nsecuritizations are primarily in connection\nwith government agency securitizations. The\nfirm accounts for a securitization as a sale\nwhen it has relinquished control over the\ntransferred financial assets. Prior to\nsecuritization, the firm generally accounts\nfor assets pending transfer at fair value and\ntherefore does not typically recognize\nsignificant gains or losses upon the transfer\nof assets. Net revenues from underwriting\nactivities are recognized in connection with\nthe sales of the underlying beneficial\ninterests to investors. The firm generally\nreceives cash in exchange for the transferred\nassets but may also have continuing\ninvolvement with the transferred financial\nassets, including ownership of beneficial\ninterests in securitized financial assets,\nprimarily in the form of debt instruments. The\nfirm may also purchase senior or subordinated\nsecurities issued by securitization vehicles\n(which are typically VIEs) in connection with\nsecondary market-making activities. The\nprimary risks included in beneficial interests\nand other interests from the firm\u2019s continuing\ninvolvement with securitization vehicles are\nthe performance of the underlying collateral,\nthe position of the firm\u2019s investment in the\ncapital structure of the securitization\nvehicle and the market yield for the security.\nInterests accounted for at fair value are\nprimarily classified in level 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy.

VIE Consolidation\nAnalysis The\nenterprise with a\ncontrolling financial\ninterest in a VIE is\nknown as the primary\nbeneficiary and\nconsolidates the VIE.\nThe firm determines\nwhether it is the\nprimary beneficiary of\na VIE by performing an\nanalysis that\nprincipally considers:\n\u2022 Which variable\ninterest holder has\nthe power to direct\nthe activities of the\nVIE that most\nsignificantly impact\nthe VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance; \u2022 Which\nvariable interest\nholder has the\nobligation to absorb\nlosses or the right to\nreceive benefits from\nthe VIE that could\npotentially be\nsignificant to the\nVIE; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s\npurpose and design,\nincluding the risks\nthe VIE was designed\nto create and pass\nthrough to its\nvariable interest\nholders; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s\ncapital structure; \u2022\nThe terms between the\nVIE and its variable\ninterest holders and\nother parties involved\nwith the VIE; and \u2022\nRelated-party\nrelationships. The\nfirm reassesses its\nevaluation of whether\nan entity is a VIE\nwhen certain\nreconsideration events\noccur. The firm\nreassesses its\ndetermination of\nwhether it is the\nprimary beneficiary of\na VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current\nfacts and\ncircumstances.\n\nVIE Activities The\nfirm is principally\ninvolved with VIEs\nthrough the following\nbusiness activities:\nMortgage-Backed VIEs.\nThe firm sells\nresidential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans and securities\nto mortgage-backed\nVIEs and may retain\nbeneficial interests\nin the assets sold to\nthese VIEs. The firm\npurchases and sells\nbeneficial interests\nissued by mortgage-\nbacked VIEs in\nconnection with\nmarket-making\nactivities. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into derivatives\nwith certain of these\nVIEs, primarily\ninterest rate swaps,\nwhich are typically\nnot variable\ninterests. The firm\ngenerally enters into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk.\nReal Estate, Credit-\nand Power-Related and\nOther Investing VIEs.\nThe firm purchases\nequity and debt\nsecurities issued by\nand makes loans to\nVIEs that hold real\nestate (including\nqualified affordable\nhousing projects),\nperforming and\nnonperforming debt,\ndistressed loans,\npower-related assets\nand equity securities.\nThe firm generally\ndoes not sell assets\nto, or enter into\nderivatives with,\nthese VIEs. Corporate\nDebt and Other Asset-\nBacked VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue notes to\nclients, purchases and\nsells beneficial\ninterests issued by\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs in connection\nwith market-making\nactivities, and makes\nloans to VIEs that\nwarehouse corporate\ndebt. Certain of these\nVIEs synthetically\ncreate the exposure\nfor the beneficial\ninterests they issue\nby entering into\ncredit derivatives\nwith the firm, rather\nthan purchasing the\nunderlying assets. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into\nderivatives, such as\ntotal return swaps,\nwith certain corporate\ndebt and other asset-\nbacked VIEs, under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE a return due\nto the beneficial\ninterest holders and\nreceives the return on\nthe collateral owned\nby the VIE. The\ncollateral owned by\nthese VIEs is\nprimarily other asset-\nbacked loans and\nsecurities. The firm\nmay be removed as the\ntotal return swap\ncounterparty and may\nenter into derivatives\nwith other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk\nrelated to these\nswaps. The firm may\nsell assets to the\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs it structures.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form       68  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs\nown portfolios of\nassets, principally\nwith exposure to hedge\nfunds. Substantially\nall of the principal\nprotection on the\nnotes issued by these\nVIEs is provided by\nthe asset portfolio\nrebalancing that is\nrequired under the\nterms of the notes.\nThe firm enters into\ntotal return swaps\nwith these VIEs under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE the return due\nto the principal-\nprotected note holders\nand receives the\nreturn on the assets\nowned by the VIE. The\nfirm may enter into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk. The\nfirm also obtains\nfunding through these\nVIEs. Investments in\nFunds. The firm makes\nequity investments in\ncertain investment\nfund VIEs it manages\nand is entitled to\nreceive fees from\nthese VIEs. The firm\nhas generally not sold\nassets to, or entered\ninto derivatives with,\nthese VIEs.\nNonconsolidated VIEs\nThe table below presents a summary of the\nnonconsolidated VIEs in which the firm holds\nvariable interests.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  mil\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  non\u2026              Septe\u2026            Decem\u2026  \n  VIEs       As of  2023              2022    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Ass\u2026                                        \n  in      $  190,\u2026          $  181,\u2026          \n  VIEs                                        \n  Car\u2026                                        \n  val\u2026                                        \n  of                                          \n  var\u2026    $  14,0\u2026          $  12,3\u2026          \n  int\u2026                                        \n  \u2014                                           \n  ass\u2026                                        \n  Car\u2026                                        \n  val\u2026                                        \n  of                                          \n  var\u2026    $    924          $    659          \n  int\u2026                                        \n  \u2014                                           \n  lia\u2026                                        \n  Max\u2026                                        \n  exp\u2026                                        \n  to                                          \n  los\u2026                                        \n  Ret\u2026    $  5,438          $  5,043          \n  int\u2026                                        \n  Pur\u2026         905               861          \n  int\u2026                                        \n  Com\u2026                                        \n  and        3,994             3,087          \n  gua\u2026                                        \n  Der\u2026       8,623             8,802          \n  Debt                                        \n  and        7,314             6,026          \n  equ\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026    $  26,2\u2026          $  23,8\u2026          \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 The nature of the firm\u2019s variable interests\nis described in the rows under maximum\nexposure to loss.\n\u2022 The firm\u2019s exposure to the obligations of\nVIEs is generally limited to its interests in\nthese entities.

The\ntotal commitment\namount does not\nnecessarily reflect\nactual future cash\nflows because the firm\nmay syndicate portions\nof these commitments.\nIn addition,\ncommitments can expire\nunused or be reduced\nor cancelled at the\ncounterparty\u2019s\nrequest. The firm also\nprovides credit to\nconsumers by issuing\ncredit card lines and\nthrough commitments to\nprovide unsecured\ninstallment loans.\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout lending\ncommitments.\n                                              \n  $ in              Septe\u2026            Decem\u2026  \n  mil\u2026       As of  2023              2022    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Held                                        \n  for     $  232,\u2026          $  222,\u2026          \n  inv\u2026                                        \n  Held                                        \n  for        5,955             3,355          \n  sale                                        \n  At                                          \n  fair         793             1,094          \n  val\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026    $  239,\u2026          $  227,\u2026          \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\n\u2022 Held for investment\nlending commitments\nare accounted for at\namortized cost.

The firm also extends\nlending commitments in connection with other\ntypes of corporate lending, commercial real\nestate financing and other collateralized\nlending.See Note 9 for further information\nabout funded loans. To mitigate the credit\nrisk associated with the firm\u2019s commercial\nlending activities, the firm obtains credit\nprotection on certain loans and lending\ncommitments through credit default swaps, both\nsingle-name and index-based contracts, and\nthrough the issuance of credit-linked notes.\nWarehouse Financing.

See the tables in\n\u201cCommitments\u201d above for a summary of the\nfirm\u2019s commitments.\n\u2022 The carrying value\nfor derivatives\nincluded derivative\nassets of $ 363million\nas of September 2023\nand $ 578million as of\nDecember 2022, and\nderivative liabilities\nof $ 7.26billion as of\nSeptember 2023 and $\n8.06billion as of\nDecember 2022.\n\nDerivative Guarantees.\nThe firm enters into\nvarious derivatives\nthat meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee under U.S.\nGAAP, including\nwritten equity and\ncommodity put options,\nwritten currency\ncontracts and interest\nrate caps, floors and\nswaptions. These\nderivatives are risk\nmanaged together with\nderivatives that do\nnot meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, and\ntherefore the amounts\nin the table above do\nnot reflect the firm\u2019s\noverall risk related\nto derivative\nactivities.\nDisclosures about\nderivatives are not\nrequired if they may\nbe cash settled and\nthe firm has no basis\nto conclude it is\nprobable that the\ncounterparties held\nthe underlying\ninstruments at the\ninception of the\ncontract. The firm has\nconcluded that these\nconditions have been\nmet for certain large,\ninternationally active\ncommercial and\ninvestment bank\ncounterparties,\ncentral clearing\ncounterparties, hedge\nfunds and certain\nother counterparties.\nAccordingly, the firm\nhas not included such\ncontracts in the table\nabove. See Note 7 for\ninformation about\ncredit derivatives\nthat meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, which are\nnot included in the\ntable above.\nDerivatives are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue and therefore\nthe carrying value is\nconsidered the best\nindication of\npayment/performance\nrisk for individual\ncontracts. However,\nthe carrying values in\nthe table above\nexclude the effect of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting.\nSecurities Lending and\nClearing Guarantees .\nSecurities lending and\nclearing guarantees\ninclude the\nindemnifications and\nguarantees that the\nfirm provides in its\ncapacity as an agency\nlender and in its\ncapacity as a\nsponsoring member of\nthe Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation.\nAs an agency lender,\nthe firm indemnifies\nmost of its securities\nlending customers\nagainst losses\nincurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not\nreturn securities and\nthe collateral held is\ninsufficient to cover\nthe market value of\nthe securities\nborrowed.The maximum\npayout of such\nindemnifications was $\n13.88billion as of\nSeptember 2023 and $\n12.23billion as of\nDecember 2022.\nCollateral held by the\nlenders in connection\nwith securities\nlending\nindemnifications was $\n14.37billion as of\nSeptember 2023 and $\n12.62billion as of\nDecember 2022. Because\nthe contractual nature\nof these arrangements\nrequires the firm to\nobtain collateral with\na market value that\nexceeds the value of\nthe securities lent to\nthe borrower, there is\nminimal performance\nrisk associated with\nthese\nindemnifications.\n                                              \n  73    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nAs a sponsoring member of the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the\nperformance of its sponsored member clients to\nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in\nconnection with certain resale and repurchase\nagreements. To minimize potential losses on\nsuch guarantees, the firm obtains a security\ninterest in the collateral that the sponsored\nclient placed with the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on\nsuch guarantees is minimal. The maximum payout\non this guarantee was $ 14.28billion as of\nSeptember 2023 and $ 8.74billion as of\nDecember 2022. The related collateral held was\n$ 14.25billion as of September 2023 and $\n8.70billion as of December 2022. Other\nFinancial Guarantees . In the ordinary course\nof business, the firm provides other financial\nguarantees of the obligations of third parties\n(e.g., standby letters of credit and other\nguarantees to enable clients to complete\ntransactions and fund-related guarantees).\nThese guarantees represent obligations to make\npayments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed\nparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a\ncontractual arrangement with that\nbeneficiary.Other financial guarantees also\ninclude a guarantee that the firm has provided\nto the Government of Malaysia that it will\nreceive, by August 2025, at least $ 1.4billion\nin assets and proceeds from assets seized by\ngovernmental authorities around the world\nrelated to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a\nsovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In\nconnection with this guarantee, the firm\nagreed to make a one-time interim payment of $\n250million towards the $ 1.4billion if the\nGovernment of Malaysia did not receive at\nleast $ 500million in assets and proceeds by\nAugust 2022. The firm does not believe that\nany interim payment is required. Any amounts\npaid by the firm would, in any event, be\nsubject to reimbursement in the event the\nassets and proceeds received by the Government\nof Malaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed $\n1.4billion. On October 11, 2023, the firm\nfiled a demand for arbitration alleging that\nthe Government of Malaysia had, as of August\n2022, recovered assets and proceeds well in\nexcess of $ 500million; it had recovered\nsubstantial additional assets and proceeds\nthat should be credited against the guarantee;\nand it had not used all reasonable efforts to\nrecover other assets and proceeds that could\nbe credited against the guarantee. See Note 27\nfor further information about matters related\nto 1MDB. Guarantees of Securities Issued by\nTrusts. The firm has established trusts,\nincluding Goldman Sachs Capital I, Goldman\nSachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III\n(the Trusts), and other entities, for the\nlimited purpose of issuing securities to third\nparties, lending the proceeds to the firm and\nentering into contractual arrangements with\nthe firm and third parties related to this\npurpose. The firm does not consolidate these\nentities. See Notes 14 and 19 for further\ninformation about the transactions involving\nthe Trusts. The firm effectively provides for\nthe full and unconditional guarantee of the\nsecurities issued by these entities. Timely\npayment by the firm of amounts due to these\nentities under the guarantee, borrowing,\npreferred stock and related contractual\narrangements will be sufficient to cover\npayments due on the securities issued by these\nentities. No subsidiary of Group Inc.\nguarantees the securities of the Trusts.\nManagement believes that it is unlikely that\nany circumstances will occur, such as\nnonperformance on the part of paying agents or\nother service providers, that would make it\nnecessary for the firm to make payments\nrelated to these entities other than those\nrequired under the terms of the guarantee,\nborrowing, preferred stock and related\ncontractual arrangements and in connection\nwith certain expenses incurred by these\nentities. Indemnities and Guarantees of\nService Providers. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees\ncertain service providers, such as clearing\nand custody agents, trustees and\nadministrators, against specified potential\nlosses in connection with their acting as an\nagent of, or providing services to, the firm\nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses\narising from its custodial role or caused by\nacts or omissions of third-party service\nproviders, including sub-custodians and third-\nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has\nthe right to seek indemnification from these\nthird-party service providers for certain\nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In\naddition, the firm is a member of payment,\nclearing and settlement networks, as well as\nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of\nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of\nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In\nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear\nand settle transactions entered into by\nclients with other brokerage firms. The firm\u2019s\nobligations in respect of such transactions\nare secured by the assets in the client\u2019s\naccount and proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the firm\non behalf of the client. In connection with\njoint venture investments, the firm may issue\nloan guarantees under which it may be liable\nin the event of fraud, misappropriation,\nenvironmental liabilities and other matters\ninvolving the borrower.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form       74  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Other\nRepresentations,\nWarranties and\nIndemnifications. The\nfirm provides\nrepresentations and\nwarranties to\ncounterparties in\nconnection with a\nvariety of commercial\ntransactions and\noccasionally\nindemnifies them\nagainst potential\nlosses caused by the\nbreach of those\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. The firm\nmay also provide\nindemnifications\nprotecting against\nchanges in or adverse\napplication of certain\nU.S. tax laws in\nconnection with\nordinary-course\ntransactions, such as\nsecurities issuances,\nborrowings or\nderivatives. In\naddition, the firm may\nprovide\nindemnifications to\nsome counterparties to\nprotect them in the\nevent additional taxes\nare owed or payments\nare withheld, due\neither to a change in\nor an adverse\napplication of certain\nnon-U.S. tax laws.\nThese\nindemnifications, as\nwell as\nindemnifications\nprovided by the firm\non other contractual\nor other obligations,\ngenerally are standard\ncontractual terms and\nare entered into in\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness. Generally,\nthere are no stated or\nnotional amounts\nincluded in these\nindemnifications, and\nthe contingencies\ntriggering the\nobligation to\nindemnify are not\nexpected to occur. The\nfirm is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder these guarantees\nand indemnifications.\nHowever, management\nbelieves that it is\nunlikely the firm will\nhave to make any\nmaterial payments\nunder these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\narrangements have been\nrecognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both\nSeptember 2023 and\nDecember 2022.\nGuarantees of\nSubsidiaries.

In\naddition, Group Inc.\nhas provided\nguarantees to Goldman\nSachs International\n(GSI) and GSBE related\nto agreements that\neach entity has\nentered into with\ncertain of its\ncounterparties. Group\nInc. guarantees many\nof the obligations of\nits other consolidated\nsubsidiaries on a\ntransaction-by-\ntransaction basis, as\nnegotiated with\ncounterparties.

Regulation\nand Capital Adequacy\nThe FRB is the primary\nregulator of Group\nInc., a bank holding\ncompany under the U.S.\nBank Holding Company\nAct of 1956 and a\nfinancial holding\ncompany under\namendments to this\nAct. The firm is\nsubject to\nconsolidated\nregulatory capital\nrequirements which are\ncalculated in\naccordance with the\nregulations of the FRB\n(Capital Framework).\nThe capital\nrequirements are\nexpressed as risk-\nbased capital and\nleverage ratios that\ncompare measures of\nregulatory capital to\nrisk-weighted assets\n(RWAs), average assets\nand off-balance sheet\nexposures. Failure to\ncomply with these\ncapital requirements\nwould result in\nrestrictions being\nimposed by the firm\u2019s\nregulators and could\nlimit the firm\u2019s\nability to repurchase\nshares, pay dividends\nand make certain\ndiscretionary\ncompensation payments.\nThe firm\u2019s capital\nlevels are also\nsubject to qualitative\njudgments by the\nregulators about\ncomponents of capital,\nrisk weightings and\nother factors.\nFurthermore, certain\nof the firm\u2019s\nsubsidiaries are\nsubject to separate\nregulations and\ncapital requirements.\nCapital Framework The\nregulations under the\nCapital Framework are\nlargely based on the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\u2019s\n(Basel Committee)\ncapital framework for\nstrengthening\ninternational capital\nstandards (Basel III)\nand also implement\ncertain provisions of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act.\nUnder the Capital\nFramework, the firm is\nan \u201cAdvanced\napproaches\u201d banking\norganization and has\nbeen designated as a\nglobal systemically\nimportant bank\n(G-SIB). The Capital\nFramework includes the\nminimum risk-based\ncapital and the\ncapital conservation\nbuffer requirements.\nThe buffer must\nconsist entirely of\ncapital that qualifies\nas Common Equity Tier\n1 (CET1) capital. The\nfirm calculates its\nCET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total\ncapital ratios in\naccordance with both\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules. Each of the\nratios calculated\nunder the Standardized\nand Advanced Capital\nRules must meet its\nrespective capital\nrequirements. Under\nthe Capital Framework,\nthe firm is also\nsubject to leverage\nrequirements which\nconsist of a minimum\nTier 1 leverage ratio\nand a minimum\nsupplementary leverage\nratio (SLR), as well\nas the SLR buffer.\n\nConsolidated\nRegulatory Capital\nRequirements\nRisk-Based Capital\nRatios.

These\nrequirements also\ninclude the capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements,\nconsisting of the\nG-SIB surcharge\n(Method 2) of 3.0% as\nof September 2023 and\n2.5% as of December\n2022 and the\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer, which\nthe FRB has set to\nzero percent. In\naddition, the capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements include\nthe stress capital\nbuffer (SCB) of 6.3%\nunder the Standardized\nCapital Rules and a\nbuffer of 2.5% under\nthe Advanced Capital\nRules.\n\n\u2022 The G-SIB surcharge\nis updated annually\nbased on financial\ndata from the prior\nyear and is generally\napplicable for the\nfollowing year. The\nG-SIB surcharge is\ncalculated using two\nmethodologies, the\nhigher of which is\nreflected in the\nfirm\u2019s risk-based\ncapital requirements.\nThe first calculation\n(Method 1) is based on\nthe Basel Committee\u2019s\nmethodology which,\namong other factors,\nrelies upon measures\nof the size, activity\nand complexity of each\nG-SIB. The second\ncalculation (Method 2)\nuses similar inputs\nbut includes a measure\nof reliance on short-\nterm wholesale\nfunding.\n\nBased on the firm\u2019s\n2023 Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and\nReview submission, the\nFRB has set the SCB\nfor the firm at 5.5%\nunder the Standardized\nCapital Rules for the\nperiod from October 1,\n2023 through September\n30, 2024.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form       78  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

RWAs are\ncalculated in\naccordance with both\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules. Credit Risk\nCredit RWAs are\ncalculated based on\nmeasures of exposure,\nwhich are then risk\nweighted under the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules: \u2022 The\nStandardized Capital\nRules apply prescribed\nrisk-weights, which\ndepend largely on the\ntype of counterparty.\nThe exposure measures\nfor derivatives and\nsecurities financing\ntransactions are based\non specific formulas\nwhich take certain\nfactors into\nconsideration. \u2022 Under\nthe Advanced Capital\nRules, the firm\ncomputes risk-weights\nfor wholesale and\nretail credit\nexposures in\naccordance with the\nAdvanced Internal\nRatings-Based\napproach. The exposure\nmeasures for\nderivatives and\nsecurities financing\ntransactions are\ncomputed utilizing\ninternal models. \u2022 For\nboth Standardized and\nAdvanced credit RWAs,\nthe risk-weights for\nsecuritizations and\nequities are based on\nspecific required\nformulaic approaches.\nMarket Risk RWAs for\nmarket risk in\naccordance with the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules\nare generally\nconsistent. Market\nRWAs are calculated\nbased on measures of\nexposure which include\nthe following: \u2022\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) is\nthe potential loss in\nvalue of trading\nassets and\nliabilities, as well\nas certain\ninvestments, loans,\nand other financial\nassets and liabilities\naccounted for at fair\nvalue, due to adverse\nmarket movements over\na defined time horizon\nwith a specified\nconfidence level.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form       80  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For\nrisk management\npurposes, a 95% one-\ndayVaR is used,\nwhereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements,\na 99% 10-dayVaR is\nused to determine\nMarket RWAs and a 99%\none-dayVaR is used to\ndetermine regulatory\nVaR exceptions. In\naddition, the daily\nnet revenues used to\ndetermine risk\nmanagement VaR\nexceptions (i.e.,\ncomparing the daily\nnet revenues to the\nVaR measure calculated\nas of the end of the\nprior business day)\ninclude intraday\nactivity, whereas the\nCapital Framework\nrequires that intraday\nactivity be excluded\nfrom daily net\nrevenues when\ncalculating regulatory\nVaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity\nincludes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are\nmore likely than not\nto be positive by\ntheir nature. As a\nresult, there may be\ndifferences in the\nnumber of VaR\nexceptions and the\namount of daily net\nrevenues calculated\nfor regulatory VaR\ncompared to the\namounts calculated for\nrisk management VaR.\nThe firm\u2019s positional\nlosses observed on a\nsingle day exceeded\nits 99% one-\ndayregulatory VaR on\none occasion during\nboth the nine months\nended September 2023\nand the year ended\n2022. There was no\nchange in the firm\u2019s\nVaR multiplier used to\ncalculate Market RWAs;\n\u2022 Stressed VaR is the\npotential loss in\nvalue of trading\nassets and\nliabilities, as well\nas certain\ninvestments, loans,\nand other financial\nassets and liabilities\naccounted for at fair\nvalue, during a period\nof significant market\nstress; \u2022 Incremental\nrisk is the potential\nloss in value of non-\nsecuritized positions\ndue to the default or\ncredit migration of\nissuers of financial\ninstruments over a\none-year time horizon;\n\u2022 Comprehensive risk\nis the potential loss\nin value, due to price\nrisk and defaults,\nwithin the firm\u2019s\ncredit correlation\npositions; and \u2022\nSpecific risk is the\nrisk of loss on a\nposition that could\nresult from factors\nother than broad\nmarket movements,\nincluding event risk,\ndefault risk and\nidiosyncratic risk.\nThe standardized\nmeasurement method is\nused to determine\nspecific risk RWAs, by\napplying supervisory\ndefined risk-weighting\nfactors after\napplicable netting is\nperformed.\n\nOperational Risk\nOperational RWAs are\nonly required to be\nincluded under the\nAdvanced Capital\nRules.

GS Bank USA\nis the firm\u2019s primary\nU.S. bank subsidiary.\nGS Bank USA is a New\nYork State-chartered\nbank and a member of\nthe Federal Reserve\nSystem, is supervised\nand regulated by the\nFRB, the FDIC, the New\nYork State Department\nof Financial Services\n(NYDFS) and the\nConsumer Financial\nProtection Bureau, and\nis subject to\nregulatory capital\nrequirements that are\ncalculated under the\nCapital Framework. GS\nBank USA is an\nAdvanced approaches\nbanking organization\nunder the Capital\nFramework. The\ndeposits of GS Bank\nUSA are insured by the\nFDIC to the extent\nprovided by law. The\nCapital Framework\nincludes the minimum\nrisk-based capital and\nthe capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements\n(consisting of a 2.5%\nbuffer and the\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer). The\nbuffer must consist\nentirely of capital\nthat qualifies as CET1\ncapital. In addition,\nthe Capital Framework\nincludes the leverage\nratio requirement. GS\nBank USA is required\nto calculate the CET1\ncapital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total\ncapital ratios in\naccordance with both\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules. The lower of\neach risk-based\ncapital ratio under\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules\nis the ratio against\nwhich GS Bank USA\u2019s\ncompliance with its\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements is\nassessed. In addition,\nunder the regulatory\nframework for prompt\ncorrective action\napplicable to GS Bank\nUSA, in order to meet\nthe quantitative\nrequirements for a\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\ndepository\ninstitution, GS Bank\nUSA must also meet the\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nrequirements in the\ntable below. GS Bank\nUSA\u2019s capital levels\nand prompt corrective\naction classification\nare also subject to\nqualitative judgments\nby the regulators\nabout components of\ncapital, risk\nweightings and other\nfactors.

Income Taxes Provision for Income\nTaxes Income taxes are provided for using the\nasset and liability method under which\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. The firm reports\ninterest expense related to income tax matters\nin provision for taxes and income tax\npenalties in other expenses. Deferred Income\nTaxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net\ntax effects of temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. These temporary\ndifferences result in taxable or deductible\namounts in future years and are measured using\nthe tax rates and laws that will be in effect\nwhen such differences are expected to reverse.\nValuation allowances are established to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount that more\nlikely than not will be realized and primarily\nrelate to the ability to utilize losses in\nvarious tax jurisdictions. Tax assets are\nincluded in other assets and tax liabilities\nare included in other liabilities.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits The firm recognizes\ntax positions in the consolidated financial\nstatements only when it is more likely than\nnot that the position will be sustained on\nexamination by the relevant taxing authority\nbased on the technical merits of the position.\nA position that meets this standard is\nmeasured at the largest amount of benefit that\nwill more likely than not be realized on\nsettlement. A liability is established for\ndifferences between positions taken in a tax\nreturn and amounts recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Regulatory\nTax Examinations The firm is subject to\nexamination by the U.S. Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) and other taxing authorities in\njurisdictions where the firm has significant\nbusiness operations, such as the United\nKingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states,\nsuch as New York. The tax years under\nexamination vary by jurisdiction. The firm\ndoes not expect completion of these audits to\nhave a material impact on the firm\u2019s financial\ncondition, but it may be material to operating\nresults for a particular period, depending, in\npart, on the operating results for that\nperiod.\n                                              \n  87    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Business Segments The firm manages\nand reports its activities in threebusiness\nsegments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset &\nWealth Management and Platform Solutions. See\nNote 1 for information about the firm\u2019s\nbusiness segments. Compensation and benefits\nexpenses in the firm\u2019s segments reflect, among\nother factors, the overall performance of the\nfirm, as well as the performance of individual\nbusinesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in\none segment of the firm\u2019s business may be\nsignificantly affected by the performance of\nthe firm\u2019s other business segments. The firm\nallocates assets (including allocations of\nglobal core liquid assets and cash, secured\nclient financing and other assets), revenues\nand expenses among the threebusiness segments.\nDue to the integrated nature of these\nsegments, estimates and judgments are made in\nallocating certain assets, revenues and\nexpenses. The allocation process is based on\nthe manner in which management currently views\nthe performance of the segments. The\nallocation of common shareholders\u2019 equity and\npreferred stock dividends to each segment is\nbased on the estimated amount of equity\nrequired to support the activities of the\nsegment under relevant regulatory capital\nrequirements. Net earnings for each segment is\ncalculated by applying the firmwide tax rate\nto each segment\u2019s pre-tax earnings. Management\nbelieves that this allocation provides a\nreasonable representation of each segment\u2019s\ncontribution to consolidated net earnings to\ncommon, return on average common equity and\ntotal assets. Transactions between segments\nare based on specific criteria or approximate\nthird-party rates.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form       88  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These\nactivities expose the\nfirm to many different\nindustries and\ncounterparties, and\nmay also subject the\nfirm to a\nconcentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular central\nbank, counterparty,\nborrower or issuer,\nincluding sovereign\nissuers, or to a\nparticular\nclearinghouse or\nexchange. The firm\nseeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by\nactively monitoring\nexposures and\nobtaining collateral\nfrom counterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm\nconsiders when\ndetermining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts. Netting and\ncollateral agreements\npermit the firm to\noffset receivables and\npayables with such\ncounterparties and/or\nenable the firm to\nobtain collateral on\nan upfront or\ncontingent basis.\nThe table below\npresents the credit\nconcentrations\nincluded in trading\ncash instruments and\ninvestments.\n                                              \n  $ in              Septe\u2026            Decem\u2026  \n  mil\u2026       As of  2023              2022    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S.                                        \n  gov\u2026                                        \n  and     $  265,\u2026          $  205,\u2026          \n  age\u2026                                        \n  obl\u2026                                        \n  Per\u2026                                        \n  of          16.8  %           14.3  %       \n  tot\u2026                                        \n  ass\u2026                                        \n  Non\u2026                                        \n  gov\u2026                                        \n  and     $  77,1\u2026          $  40,3\u2026          \n  age\u2026                                        \n  obl\u2026                                        \n  Per\u2026                                        \n  of           4.9  %            2.8  %       \n  tot\u2026                                        \n  ass\u2026                                        \n                                              \nIn addition, the firm\nhad $ 205.39billion as\nof September 2023 and\n$ 208.53billion as of\nDecember 2022 of cash\ndeposits held at\ncentral banks\n(included in cash and\ncash equivalents), of\nwhich $ 122.53billion\nas of September 2023\nand $ 165.77billion as\nof December 2022 was\nheld at the Federal\nReserve.\nAs of both September\n2023 and December\n2022, the firm did not\nhave credit exposure\nto any other\ncounterparty that\nexceeded 2% of total\nassets.\nCollateral obtained by\nthe firm related to\nderivative assets is\nprincipally cash and\nis held by the firm or\na third-party\ncustodian.

Note 27.\nLegal Proceedings The firm is involved in a\nnumber of judicial, regulatory and arbitration\nproceedings (including those described below)\nconcerning matters arising in connection with\nthe conduct of the firm\u2019s businesses. Many of\nthese proceedings are in early stages, and\nmany of these cases seek an indeterminate\namount of damages. Under ASC 450, an event is\n\u201creasonably possible\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the\nfuture event or events occurring is more than\nremote but less than likely\u201d and an event is\n\u201cremote\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the future event or\nevents occurring is slight.\u201d Thus, references\nto the upper end of the range of reasonably\npossible loss for cases in which the firm is\nable to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible loss mean the upper end of the range\nof loss for cases for which the firm believes\nthe risk of loss is more than slight.\n\nWith respect to matters described below for\nwhich management has been able to estimate a\nrange of reasonably possible loss where (i)\nactual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an\namount of money damages, (ii) the firm is\nbeing, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers\nin a securities offering and is not being\nindemnified by a party that the firm believes\nwill pay the full amount of any judgment, or\n(iii) the purchasers are demanding that the\nfirm repurchase securities, management has\nestimated the upper end of the range of\nreasonably possible loss based on (a) in the\ncase of (i), the amount of money damages\nclaimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the\ndifference between the initial sales price of\nthe securities that the firm sold in such\noffering and the estimated lowest subsequent\nprice of such securities prior to the action\nbeing commenced and (c) in the case of (iii),\nthe price that purchasers paid for the\nsecurities less the estimated value, if any,\nas of September 2023 of the relevant\nsecurities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and\n(iii), taking into account any other factors\nbelieved to be relevant to the particular\nmatter or matters of that type. As o f the\ndate hereof, the firm has estimated the upper\nend of the range of reasonably possible\naggregate loss for such matters and for any\nother matters described below w here\nmanagement has been able to estimate a range\nof reasonably possible aggregate loss to be\napproximately $ 2.2billion in excess of the\naggregate reserves for such matters. Managemen\nt is generally unable to estimate a range of\nreasonably possible loss for matters other\nthan those included in the estimate above,\nincluding where (i) actual or potential\nplaintiffs have not claimed an amount of money\ndamages, except in those instances where\nmanagement can otherwise determine an\nappropriate amount, (ii) matte rs are in early\nstages, (iii) matters relate to regulatory\ninvestigations or reviews, except in those\ninstances where management can otherwise\ndetermine an appropriate amount, (iv) there is\nuncertainty as to the likelihood of a class\nbeing certified or the ultimate size of the\nclass, (v) there is uncertainty as to the\noutcome of pending appeals or motions, (vi)\nthere are significant factual issues to be\nresolved, and/or (vii) there are novel legal\nissues presented. For example, the firm\u2019s\npotential liabilities with respect to the\ninvestigations and reviews described below in\n\u201cRegulatory Investigations and Reviews and\nRelated Litigation\u201d generally are not included\nin management\u2019s estimate of reasonably\npossible loss. However, management does not\nbelieve, based on currently available\ninformation, that the outcomes of such other\nmatters will have a material adverse effect on\nthe firm\u2019s financial condition, though the\noutcomes could be material to the firm\u2019s\noperating results for any particular period,\ndepending, in part, upon the operating results\nfor such period.\n                                              \n  91    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

On November 1, 2018,\nthe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed\na criminal information and guilty plea by Tim\nLeissner, a former participating managing\ndirector of the firm, and an indictment\nagainst Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing\ndirector of the firm. On August 28, 2018,\nLeissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork of conspiring to launder money and to\nviolate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct\u2019s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal\naccounting controls provisions. Ng was charged\nwith conspiring to launder money and to\nviolate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery and internal\naccounting controls provisions, and on April\n8, 2022, Ng was found guilty on all counts\nfollowing a trial. On August 18, 2020, the\nfirm announced that it entered into a\nsettlement agreement with the Government of\nMalaysia to resolve the criminal and\nregulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving\nthe firm, which includes a guarantee that the\nGovernment of Malaysia receives at least $\n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets\nseized by governmental authorities around the\nworld related to 1MDB. See Note 18 for further\ninformation about this guarantee, including\nrelated arbitration proceedings. On October\n22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached\nsettlements of governmental and regulatory\ninvestigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ,\nthe SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the FCA, the PRA,\nthe Singapore Attorney General\u2019s Chambers, the\nSingapore Commercial Affairs Department, the\nMonetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong\nKong Securities and Futures Commission.

The same\nGoldman Sachs entities are also among the\ndefendants named in two antitrust actions\nrelating to the trading of interest rate\nswaps, commenced in April 2016 and June 2018,\nrespectively, in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York by three\noperators of swap execution facilities and\ncertain of their affiliates. These actions\nhave been consolidated for pretrial\nproceedings. The complaints generally assert\nclaims under federal antitrust law and state\ncommon law in connection with an alleged\nconspiracy among the defendants to preclude\nexchange trading of interest rate swaps. The\ncomplaints in the individual actions also\nassert claims under state antitrust law. The\ncomplaints seek declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, as well as treble damages in an\nunspecified amount. Defendants moved to\ndismiss the class and the first individual\naction and the district court dismissed the\nstate common law claims asserted by the\nplaintiffs in the first individual action and\notherwise limited the state common law claim\nin the putative class action and the antitrust\nclaims in both actions to the period from 2013\nto 2016. On November 20, 2018, the court\ngranted in part and denied in part the\ndefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the second\nindividual action, dismissing the state common\nlaw claims for unjust enrichment and tortious\ninterference, but denying dismissal of the\nfederal and state antitrust claims. On March\n13, 2019, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion in the putative class action to amend\ntheir complaint to add allegations related to\nconduct from 2008 to 2012, but granted the\nmotion to add limited allegations from 2013 to\n2016, which the plaintiffs added in a fourth\nconsolidated amended complaint filed on March\n22, 2019. The plaintiffs in the putative class\naction moved for class certification on March\n7, 2019. Commodities-Related Litigation GSI is\namong the defendants named in putative class\nactions relating to trading in platinum and\npalladium, filed beginning on November 25,\n2014 and most recently amended on May 15,\n2017, in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York. The amended\ncomplaint generally alleges that the\ndefendants violated federal antitrust laws and\nthe Commodity Exchange Act in connection with\nan alleged conspiracy to manipulate a\nbenchmark for physical platinum and palladium\nprices and seek declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, as well as treble damages in an\nunspecified amount. On March 29, 2020, the\ncourt granted the defendants\u2019 motions to\ndismiss and for reconsideration, resulting in\nthe dismissal of all claims, and on February\n27, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s\ndismissal of certain plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust\nclaims and vacated the district court\u2019s\ndismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 Commodity\nExchange Act claim. On April 12, 2023, the\ndefendants\u2019 petition for rehearing or\nrehearing en banc with the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit was denied. On\nJuly 21, 2023, the defendants filed a motion\nfor judgment on the pleadings. GS&Co., GSI, J.\nAron & Company and Metro International Trade\nServices (Metro), a previously consolidated\nsubsidiary of Group Inc. that was sold in the\nfourth quarter of 2014, are among the\ndefendants in a number of putative class and\nindividual actions filed beginning on August\n1, 2013 and consolidated in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York.\nThe complaints generally allege violations of\nfederal antitrust laws and state laws in\nconnection with the storage of aluminum and\naluminum trading. The complaints seek\ndeclaratory, injunctive and other equitable\nrelief, as well as unspecified monetary\ndamages, including treble damages. In December\n2016, the district court granted defendants\u2019\nmotions to dismiss and on August 27, 2019, the\nSecond Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s\ndismissals and remanded the case to district\ncourt for further proceedings. On July 23,\n2020, the district court denied the class\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification,\nand on December 16, 2020 the Second Circuit\ndenied leave to appeal the denial. On February\n17, 2021, the district court granted\ndefendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment with\nrespect to the claims of most of the\nindividual plaintiffs. On April 14, 2021, the\nplaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. On May 31,\n2022, the two remaining individual plaintiffs\nentered into a settlement with the defendants.\nThe firm has paid the full amount of its\ncontribution to the settlement. In connection\nwith the sale of Metro, the firm agreed to\nprovide indemnities to the buyer, including\nfor any potential liabilities for legal or\nregulatory proceedings arising out of the\nconduct of Metro\u2019s business while the firm\nowned it.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form      102  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

GS&Co. is also among the primary\ndealers named as defendants in a similar\nindividual action filed in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York on\nAugust 25, 2017. The consolidated class action\ncomplaint, filed on December 29, 2017,\ngenerally alleges that the defendants violated\nantitrust laws in connection with an alleged\nconspiracy to manipulate the when-issued\nmarket and auctions for U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and that certain defendants,\nincluding GS&Co., colluded to preclude trading\nof U.S. Treasury securities on electronic\ntrading platforms in order to impede\ncompetition in the bidding process. The\nindividual action alleges a similar conspiracy\nregarding manipulation of the when-issued\nmarket and auctions, as well as related\nfutures and options in violation of the\nCommodity Exchange Act. The complaints seek\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, treble\ndamages in an unspecified amount and\nrestitution. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was\ngranted on March 31, 2021. On May 14, 2021,\nplaintiffs filed an amended complaint.\nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended\ncomplaint was granted on March 31, 2022.

The amended consolidated complaint,\nfiled on October 29, 2020, asserts claims\nunder federal antitrust law in connection with\nalleged anti-competitive conduct by the\ndefendants in the secondary market for odd-\nlots of corporate bonds, and seeks declaratory\nand injunctive relief, as well as unspecified\nmonetary damages, including treble and\npunitive damages and restitution. On October\n25, 2021, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion\nto dismiss with prejudice. On November 23,\n2021, plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. On November\n10, 2022, the district court denied the\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for an indicative ruling\nthat the judgment should be vacated because\nthe wife of the district judge owned stock in\none of the defendants and the district judge\ndid not recuse himself. Credit Default Swap\nAntitrust Litigation Group Inc., GS&Co. and\nGSI were among the defendants named in a\nputative antitrust class action relating to\nthe settlement of credit default swaps, filed\non June 30, 2021 in the U.S. District Court\nfor the District of New Mexico.

The use of\nfair value to measure\nfinancial instruments\nis fundamental to our\nrisk management\npractices and is our\nmost critical\naccounting policy.\n\nThe fair value of a\nfinancial instrument\nis the amount that\nwould be received to\nsell an asset or paid\nto transfer a\nliability in an\norderly transaction\nbetween market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date. We\nmeasure certain\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based\non its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit\nrisks). In determining\nfair value, the\nhierarchy under U.S.\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles\n(U.S. GAAP) gives (i)\nthe highest priority\nto unadjusted quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets for identical,\nunrestricted assets or\nliabilities (level 1\ninputs), (ii) the next\npriority to inputs\nother than level 1\ninputs that are\nobservable, either\ndirectly or indirectly\n(level 2 inputs), and\n(iii) the lowest\npriority to inputs\nthat cannot be\nobserved in market\nactivity (level 3\ninputs). In evaluating\nthe significance of a\nvaluation input, we\nconsider, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s\nnet risk exposure to\nthat input. Assets and\nliabilities are\nclassified in their\nentirety based on the\nlowest level of input\nthat is significant to\ntheir fair value\nmeasurement.\n\nThe fair values for\nsubstantially all of\nour financial assets\nand liabilities are\nbased on observable\nprices and inputs and\nare classified in\nlevels 1 and 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\nCertain level 2 and\nlevel 3 financial\nassets and liabilities\nmay require\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments that a\nmarket participant\nwould require to\narrive at fair value\nfor factors, such as\ncounterparty and our\ncredit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer\nrestrictions,\nliquidity and\nbid/offer spreads.\n\nInstruments classified\nin level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy are\nthose which require\none or more\nsignificant inputs\nthat are not\nobservable. Level 3\nfinancial assets\nrepresented 1.6% as of\nSeptember 2023, 1.7%\nas of June 2023 and\n1.8% as of December\n2022 of our total\nassets. See Notes 4\nand 5 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\nlevel 3 financial\nassets, including\nchanges in level 3\nfinancial assets and\nrelated fair value\nmeasurements. Absent\nevidence to the\ncontrary, instruments\nclassified in level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy are\ninitially valued at\ntransaction price,\nwhich is considered to\nbe the best initial\nestimate of fair\nvalue. Subsequent to\nthe transaction date,\nwe use other\nmethodologies to\ndetermine fair value,\nwhich vary based on\nthe type of\ninstrument. Estimating\nthe fair value of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstruments requires\njudgments to be made.\nThese judgments\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Determining the\nappropriate valuation\nmethodology and/or\nmodel for each type of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstrument;\n\n\u2022 Determining model\ninputs based on an\nevaluation of all\nrelevant empirical\nmarket data, including\nprices evidenced by\nmarket transactions,\ninterest rates, credit\nspreads, volatilities\nand correlations; and\n\n\u2022 Determining\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments, including\nthose related to\nilliquidity or\ncounterparty credit\nquality.\n\nRegardless of the\nmethodology, valuation\ninputs and assumptions\nare only changed when\ncorroborated by\nsubstantive evidence.\n\nControls Over\nValuation of Financial\nInstruments.

Personnel\nwithin our independent\nrisk oversight and\ncontrol functions are\nresponsible for\nforecasting the\neconomic variables\nthat underlie the\neconomic scenarios\nthat are used in the\nmodeling of expected\ncredit losses. While\nwe use the best\ninformation available\nto determine this\nestimate, future\nadjustments to the\nallowance may be\nnecessary based on,\namong other things,\nchanges in the\neconomic environment\nor variances between\nactual results and the\noriginal assumptions\nused. Loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\n\nWe also record an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on lending\ncommitments which are\nheld for investment\nthat are accounted for\nat amortized cost.\nSuch allowance is\ndetermined using the\nsame methodology as\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses, while also\ntaking into\nconsideration the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding,\nand whether such\ncommitments are\ncancellable by us.\n\nTo estimate the\npotential impact of an\nadverse macroeconomic\nenvironment on our\nallowance for credit\nlosses, we, among\nother things, compared\nthe expected credit\nlosses under the\nweighted average\nforecast used in the\ncalculation of\nallowance for credit\nlosses as of September\n2023 (which was\nweighted towards the\nbaseline and adverse\neconomic scenarios) to\nthe expected credit\nlosses under a 100%\nweighted adverse\neconomic scenario. The\nadverse economic\nscenario of the\nforecast model\nreflects a global\nrecession in the\nfourth quarter of 2023\nthrough the third\nquarter of 2024,\nresulting in an\neconomic contraction\nand rising\nunemployment rates. A\n100% weighting to the\nadverse economic\nscenario would have\nresulted in an\napproximate $0.8\nbillion increase in\nour allowance for\ncredit losses as of\nSeptember 2023. This\nhypothetical increase\ndoes not take into\nconsideration any\npotential adjustments\nto qualitative\nreserves. The\nforecasts of\nmacroeconomic\nconditions are\ninherently uncertain\nand do not take into\naccount any other\noffsetting or\ncorrelated effects.\nThe actual credit loss\nin an adverse\nmacroeconomic\nenvironment may differ\nsignificantly from\nthis estimate. See\nNote 9 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about the\nallowance for credit\nlosses.\n                                              \n  Use of Estimates                            \n                                              \nU.S. GAAP requires us\nto make certain\nestimates and\nassumptions. In\naddition to the\nestimates we make in\nconnection with fair\nvalue measurements and\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses on loans\nand lending\ncommitments held for\ninvestment and\naccounted for at\namortized cost, the\nuse of estimates and\nassumptions is also\nimportant in\ndetermining\ndiscretionary\ncompensation accruals,\nthe accounting for\ngoodwill and\nidentifiable\nintangible assets,\nprovisions for losses\nthat may arise from\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\n(including\ngovernmental\ninvestigations), and\naccounting for income\ntaxes.\n\nA substantial portion\nof our compensation\nand benefits\nrepresents\ndiscretionary\ncompensation, which is\nfinalized at year-end.\nWe believe the most\nappropriate way to\nallocate estimated\nyear-end discretionary\ncompensation among\ninterim periods is in\nproportion to the net\nrevenues, net of\nprovision for credit\nlosses, earned in such\nperiods. In addition\nto the level of net\nrevenues, net of\nprovision for credit\nlosses, our overall\ncompensation expense\nin any given year is\nalso influenced by,\namong other factors,\noverall financial\nperformance,\nprevailing labor\nmarkets, business mix,\nthe structure of our\nshare-based\ncompensation programs\nand the external\nenvironment.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form      112  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

When assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its carrying\nvalue. If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment. Estimating\nthe fair value of our\nreporting units\nrequires judgment.\nCritical inputs to the\nfair value estimates\ninclude projected\nearnings and allocated\nequity. There is\ninherent uncertainty\nin the projected\nearnings. The carrying\nvalue of each\nreporting u nit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nDuring the second\nquarter of 2023, in\nconnection with the\nexploration of a\npotential sale of\nGreenSky, we performed\na quantitative\ngoodwill test and\ndetermined that the\ngoodwill associated\nwith Consumer\nplatforms was\nimpaired, and\naccordingly, recorded\na $504 million\nimpairment. See Note\n12 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about\ngoodwill. If we\nexperience a prolonged\nor severe period of\nweakness in the\nbusiness environment,\nfinancial markets, the\nperformance of one or\nmore of our reporting\nunits or our common\nstock price, or\nadditional increases\nin capital\nrequirements, our\ngoodwill could be\nimpaired in the\nfuture.\n\nIdentifiable\nintangible assets are\ntested for impairment\nwhen events or changes\nin circumstances\nsuggest that an\nasset\u2019s or asset\ngroup\u2019s carrying value\nmay not be fully\nrecoverable. Judgment\nis required to\nevaluate whether\nindications of\npotential impairment\nhave occurred, and to\ntest identifiable\nintangible assets for\nimpairment, if\nrequired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated undiscounted\ncash flows relating to\nthe asset or asset\ngroup is less than the\ncorresponding carrying\nvalue. In the third\nquarter of 2023, in\nconnection with the\nplanned sale of\nGreenSky, we\nclassified the related\nidentifiable\nintangible assets, loa\nns and other assets\nand associated\nliabilities as held\nfor sale and\nrecognized a $506\nmillion write-down.\nSee Note 12 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for f\nurther information\nabout identifiable\nintangible assets.\n\nWe also estimate and\nprovide for potential\nlosses that may arise\nout of litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nto the extent that\nsuch losses are\nprobable and can be\nreasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we\nestimate the upper end\nof the range of\nreasonably possible\naggregate loss in\nexcess of the related\nreserves for\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nwhere we believe the\nrisk of loss is more\nthan slight. See Notes\n18 and 27 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for\ninformation about\ncertain judicial,\nlitigation and\nregulatory\nproceedings.\nSignificant judgment\nis required in making\nthese estimates and\nour final liabilities\nmay ultimately be\nmaterially different.\nOur total estimated\nliability in respect\nof litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nis determined on a\ncase-by-case basis and\nrepresents an estimate\nof probable losses\nafter considering,\namong other factors,\nthe progress of each\ncase, proceeding or\ninvestigation, our\nexperience and the\nexperience of others\nin similar cases,\nproceedings or\ninvestigations, and\nthe opinions and views\nof legal counsel.\n\nIn accounting for\nincome taxes, we\nrecognize tax\npositions in the\nfinancial statements\nonly when it is more\nlikely than not that\nthe pos ition will be\nsustained on\nexamination by the\nrelevant taxing\nauthority based on the\ntechnical merits of\nthe position.

Operating expenses in the\nconsolidated statements of earnings were $9.05\nbillion for the third quarter of 2023, 18%\nhigher than the third quarter of 2022. Our\nefficiency ratio was 76.6% for the third\nquarter of 2023, compared with 64.3% for the\nthird quarter of 2022. The increase in\noperating expenses compared with the third\nquarter of 2022 primarily reflected higher\ncompensation and benefits expenses (reflecting\nan increase in the quarter in the year-to-date\nratio of compensation and benefits to net\nrevenues, net of provision for credit losses,\nand a reduction in the year-to-date ratio in\nthe prior year period), a $506 million write-\ndown of identifiable intangible assets related\nto GreenSky and impairments of $358 million\nrelated to commercial real estate included\nwithin consolidated investment entities (both\nin depreciation and amortization). In\naddition, transaction based expenses were\nhigher. Net provisions for litigation and\nregulatory proceedings were $15 million for\nthe third quarter of 2023 compared with $191\nmillion for the third quarter of 2022. As of\nSeptember 2023, headcount increased 3%\ncompared with June 2023 , primarily reflecting\nthe timing of campus hires . Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 2023 versus September 2022.\nOperating expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of earnings were $26.00 billion for\nthe first nine months of 2023 , 13% higher\nthan the first nine months of 2022 . Our\nefficiency ratio was 74.4% for the first nine\nmonths of 2023 , compared with our through-\nthe-cycle t arget efficiency ratio of\napproximately 60%. Our efficiency ratio was\n62.7% for the first nine months of 2022. The\nratio of compensation and benefits to net\nrevenues, net of provision for credit losses,\nwas 34.5% for the first nine months of 2023,\ncompared with 34.0% for the first half of 2023\nand 32.5% for the first nine months of 2022.\n\nThe increase in operating expenses compared\nwith the first nine months of 2022 primarily\nreflected impairments of $1.20 billion related\nto commercial real estate included within\nconsolidated investment entities, higher\ncompensation and benefits expenses, a $506\nmillion write-down related to GreenSky and an\nimpairment of goodwill of $504 million related\nto Consumer platforms (the above impairments\nand write-downs were reported in depreciation\nand amortization). In addition, transaction\nbased expenses and technology expenses were\nhigher. Net provisions for litigation and\nregulatory proceedings were $106 million for\nthe first nine months of 2023 compared with\n$407 million for the first nine months of\n2022. As of September 2023, headcount\ndecreased 5% compared with December 2022,\nprimarily reflecting a headcount reduction\ninitiative during the year. Severance-related\ncosts included in compensation and benefits\nexpenses were approximately $275 million for\nthe first nine months of 2023. Provision for\nTaxes The effective income tax rate for the\nfirst nine months of 2023 was 23.3%, up from\nthe full year income tax rate of 16.5% for\n2022, primarily due to an increase in tax on\nnon-U.S. earnings. The increase compared with\n22.3% for the first half of 2023, was\nprimarily due to write-offs of deferred tax\nassets related to the transfer of GreenSky to\nheld for sale and changes in the geographic\nmix of earnings. In May 2023, the New York\nState fiscal year 2024 budget was enacted. The\nlegislation extends the temporary increase in\nthe New York State corporate income tax rate\nfrom 6.5% to 7.25% through calendar year 2026.\nThe legislation is not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on our 2023 annual effective\ntax rate. In July 2023, the U.K. Finance (No.\n2) Act 2023 was enacted. The legislation\nenacts a domestic and multinational top-up tax\nto implement the Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax\nand Income Inclusion Rule, two of the\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment Global Anti-Base Erosion Model\nRules (Pillar Two), which will apply to us\nbeginning in calendar year 2024. Pillar Two\naims to ensure that multinationals pay a\nminimum effective corporate tax rate of 15% in\neach jurisdiction in which they operate. The\nlegislation will not impact our 2023 annual\neffective tax rate and we are currently\nevaluating the impact on our 2024 annual\neffective tax rate. We expect our 2023 tax\nrate to be under 23%.\n                                              \n  117    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form    \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We\nmake markets in equity\nsecurities and equity-\nrelated products,\nincluding ETFs,\nconvertible\nsecurities, options,\nfutures and OTC\nderivative\ninstruments. We also\nstructure and make\nmarkets in derivatives\non indices, industry\nsectors, financial\nmeasures and\nindividual company\nstocks. Our exchange-\nbased market-making\nactivities include\nmaking markets in\nstocks and ETFs,\nfutures and options on\nmajor exchanges\nworldwide. In\naddition, we generate\ncommissions and fees\nfrom executing and\nclearing institutional\nclient transactions on\nmajor stock, options\nand futures exchanges\nworldwide, as well as\nOTC transactions.\n\n\u2022 Equities financing.\nIncludes prime\nfinancing, which\nprovides financing to\nour clients for their\nsecurities trading\nactivities through\nmargin loans that are\ncollateralized by\nsecurities, cash or\nother acceptable\ncollateral. Prime\nfinancing also\nincludes services\nwhich involve lending\nsecurities to cover\ninstitutional clients\u2019\nshort sales and\nborrowing securities\nto cover our short\nsales and to make\ndeliveries into the\nmarket. We are also an\nactive participant in\nbroker-to-broker\nsecurities lending and\nthird-party agency\nlending activities. In\naddition, we execute\nswap transactions to\nprovide our clients\nwith exposure to\nsecurities and\nindices.

In\naddition, we maintain\n(i) market-making\npositions, typically\nfor a short period of\ntime, in response to,\nor in anticipation of,\nclient demand, and\n(ii) positions to\nactively manage our\nrisk exposures that\narise from these\nmarket-making\nactivities\n(collectively,\ninventory). Our\ninventory is recorded\nin trading assets\n(long positions) or\ntrading liabilities\n(short positions) in\nour consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nOur results are\ninfluenced by a\ncombination of\ninterconnected\ndrivers, including (i)\nclient activity levels\nand transactional\nbid/offer spreads\n(collectively, client\nactivity), and (ii)\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of our inventory\nand interest income\nand interest expense\nrelated to the\nholding, hedging and\nfunding of our\ninventory\n(collectively, market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges). Due to the\nintegrated nature of\nour market-making\nactivities,\ndisaggregation of net\nrevenues into client\nactivity and market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges is judgmental\nand has inherent\ncomplexities and\nlimitations.\n\nThe amount and\ncomposition of our net\nrevenues vary over\ntime as these drivers\nare impacted by\nmultiple interrelated\nfactors affecting\neconomic and market\nconditions, including\nvolatility and\nliquidity in the\nmarket, changes in\ninterest rates,\ncurrency exchange\nrates, credit spreads,\nequity prices and\ncommodity prices,\ninvestor confidence,\nand other\nmacroeconomic concerns\nand uncertainties.\n\nIn general, assuming\nall other market-\nmaking conditions\nremain constant,\nincreases in client\nactivity levels or\nbid/offer spreads tend\nto result in increases\nin net revenues, and\ndecreases tend to have\nthe opposite effect.\nHowever, changes in\nmarket-making\nconditions can\nmaterially impact\nclient activity levels\nand bid/offer spreads,\nas well as the fair\nvalue of our\ninventory. For\nexample, a decrease in\nliquidity in the\nmarket could have the\nimpact of (i)\nincreasing our\nbid/offer spread, (ii)\ndecreasing investor\nconfidence and thereby\ndecreasing client\nactivity levels, and\n(iii) widening of\ncredit spreads on our\ninventory positions.\n\nOther. We lend to\ncorporate clients,\nincluding through\nrelationship lending\nand acquisition\nfinancing. The hedges\nrelated to this\nlending and financing\nactivity are also\nreported as part of\nOther.

During the third\nquarter of 2023, Global Banking & Markets\noperated in an environment generally\ncharacterized by continued broad macroeconomic\nconcerns, including the outlook for economic\ngrowth and global central bank policy, and\nelevated geopolitical stresses. These factors\ncontributed to a decline in market-making\nactivity levels and weighed on industry-wide\ninvestment banking activity levels. In\ninvestment banking, industry-wide completed\nmergers and acquisitions transactions remained\nlower compared with elevated levels in the\nprior year, while industry-wide equity and\ndebt underwriting volumes remained below\nhistorical averages. In interest rates, the\nyield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes increased\nby 75 basis points, while in commodities, the\nprice of crude oil (WTI) increased 29%,\ncompared with the end of the second quarter of\n2023. In equities, the S&P 500 Index and MSCI\nWorld Index both decreased by 4%, compared\nwith the end of the second quarter of 2023.\n\nIn the future, if market and economic\nconditions deteriorate further, and market-\nmaking activity levels decline further or\ninvestment banking activity levels decline, or\ncredit spreads related to hedges on our\nrelationship lending portfolio tighten, net\nrevenues in Global Banking & Markets would\nlikely be negatively impacted. In addition, if\neconomic conditions deteriorate further or if\nthe creditworthiness of borrowers\ndeteriorates, provision for credit losses\nwould likely be negatively impacted. Three\nMonths Ended September 2023 versus September\n2022. Net revenues in Global Banking & Markets\nwere $8.01 billion for the third quarter of\n2023, 6% higher than the third quarter of\n2022. Investment banking fees were $1.55\nbillion, essentially unchanged compared with\nthe third quarter of 2022, due to higher net\nrevenues in Debt underwriting, primarily\ndriven by leveraged finance activity, and\nhigher net revenues in Equity underwriting,\nprimarily from initial public offerings,\noffset by lower net revenues in Advisory,\nreflecting a decline in completed mergers and\nacquisitions transactions. As of September\n2023, our Investment banking fees backlog\ndecreased compared with June 2023, primarily\ndue to lower estimated net revenues from\npotential advisory transactions. Our backlog\nrepresents an estimate of our net revenues\nfrom future transactions where we believe that\nfuture revenue realization is more likely than\nnot. We believe changes in our backlog may be\na useful indicator of client activity levels\nwhich, over the long term, impact our net\nrevenues. However, the time frame for\ncompletion and corresponding revenue\nrecognition of transactions in our backlog\nvaries based on the nature of the assignment,\nas certain transactions may remain in our\nbacklog for longer periods of time. In\naddition, our backlog is subject to certain\nlimitations, such as assumptions about the\nlikelihood that individual client transactions\nwill occur in the future. Transactions may be\ncancelled or modified, and transactions not\nincluded in the estimate may also occur. Net\nrevenues in FICC were $3.38 billion, 6% lower\nthan a strong third quarter of 2022 ,\nreflecting lower net revenues in FICC\nintermediation, driven by significantly lower\nnet revenues in currencies and commodities and\nlower net revenues in credit products,\npartially offset by significantly higher net\nrevenues in interest rate products and\nmortgages.

During the\nthird quarter of 2023,\nAsset & Wealth\nManagement operated in\nan environment\ngenerally\ncharacterized by\ncontinued broad\nmacroeconomic\nconcerns, including\ncontinued pressure in\nthe commercial real\nestate market.\nAdditionally, global\nequity and bond prices\ngenerally declined\ncompared with the end\nof the second quarter\nof 2023, negatively\naffecting assets under\nsupervision.\n\nIn the future, if\nmarket and economic\nconditions deteriorate\nfurther, it may lead\nto a further decline\nin asset prices, or\ninvestors\ntransitioning to asset\nclasses that typically\ngenerate lower fees or\nwithdrawing their\nassets, and net\nrevenues in Asset &\nWealth Management\nwould likely continue\nto be negatively\nimpacted.\n\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 2023 ver sus\nSeptember 2022. Net\nrevenues in Asset &\nWealth Management were\n$3.23 billion for the\nthird quarter of 2023,\n20% lower than the\nthird quarter of 2022,\nprimarily reflecting\nnet losses in Equity\ninvestments compared\nwith net gains in the\nprior year period,\npartially offset by\nhigher Management and\nother fees.\n\nEquity investments\nreflected net losses\nfrom investments in\nprivate equities, due\nto net losses from\nreal estate\ninvestments and\nsignificantly lower\nnet gains from\ncompany-specific\nevents, and net losses\nfrom investments in\npublic equities, both\nco mpared to net gains\nin the prior year\nperiod. The increase\nin Management and\nother fees primarily\nreflected the impact\nof higher average\nassets under\nsupervision. Incentive\nfees were lower,\ndriven by more\nsignificant harvesting\nin the prior year\nperiod. Private\nbanking and lending\nnet revenues were\nslightly higher as the\nimpact of higher\ndeposit balances and\nspreads was largely\noffset by the impact\nof the sale of\nsubstantially all of\nthe Marcus loans\nportfolio earlier in\nthe year. Net revenues\nin Debt investments\nwere unchanged.\n\nProvision for credit\nlosses was $51 million\nfor the third quarter\nof 2023, compared with\na net benefit of $13\nmillion for the third\nquarter of 2022.\nProvisions for the\nthird quarter of 2023\nreflected net\nprovisions related to\nwholesale loans,\ndriven by individual\nimpairments.\n\nOperating expenses\nwere $3.01 billion for\nthe third quarter of\n2023, 2% higher than\nthe third quarter of\n2022, due to\nimpairments of $358\nmillion related to\ncommercial real estate\nwithin consolidated\ninvestment entities,\npartially offset by\nlower compensation and\nbenefits expenses\n(reflecting a decline\nin operating\nperformance) . Pre-tax\nearnings were $174\nmillion for the third\nquarter of 2023, 84%\nlower than the third\nquarter of 2022.\n\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 2023 ver sus\nSeptember 2022. Net\nrevenues in Asset &\nWealth Management were\n$9.49 billion for the\nfirst nine months of\n2023, 3% lower than\nthe first nine months\nof 2022, reflecting\nnet losses in Equity\ninvestments compared\nwith net gains in the\nprior year period and\nsignificantly lower\nIncentive fees,\npartially offset by\nhigher Management and\nother fees and higher\nnet revenues in\nPrivate banking and\nlending. Net revenues\nin Private banking and\nlending included net\nrevenues of\napproximately $(370)\nmillion related to the\nsale of substantially\nall of the Marcus\nloans portfolio\n(offset by a related\nreserve reduction of\napproximately $440\nmillion in provision\nfor credit losses).\n\nEquity investments\nreflected net losses\nfrom investments in\nprivate equities, due\nto net losses from\nreal estate\ninvestments, compared\nwith net gains in the\nprior year period,\npartially offset by\nsignificantly lower\nnet losses from\ninvestments in public\nequities. The decrease\nin Incentive fees was\ndriven by significant\nharvesting in the\nprior year period. The\nincrease in Management\nand other fees\nprimarily reflected\nthe impact of higher\naverage assets under\nsupervision, including\nthe impact of\nacquiring NNIP. The\nincrease in Private\nbanking and lending\nnet revenues primarily\nreflected the impact\nof higher deposit\nspreads and balances,\npartially offset by\nthe impact of the sale\nof substantially all\nof the Marcus loans\nportfolio. Net\nrevenues in Debt\ninvestments were\nessentially unchanged.\n\nProvision for credit\nlosses was a net\nbenefit of $499\nmillion for the first\nnine months of 2023,\ncompared with a\nprovision of $339\nmillion for the first\nnine months of 2022.\nThe net benefit for\nthe first nine months\nof 2023 reflected\nreserve reductions\nrelated to the sale of\nsubstantially all of\nthe Marcus loans\nportfolio and lower\nbalances in corporate\nloans , partially\noffset by individual\nimpairments .\nProvisions for the\nfirst nine months of\n2022 reflected the\nimpact of broad\nmacroeconomic and\ngeopolitical concerns\nand growth in the\nMarcus loans\nportfolio.\n\nOperating expenses\nwere $9.45 billion for\nthe first nine months\nof 2023, 15% higher\nthan the first nine\nmonths of 2022,\nlargely due to\nimpairments of $1.20\nbillion related to\ncommercial real estate\nwithin consolidated\ninvestment entities .\nPre-tax earnings were\n$544 million for the\nfirst nine months of\n2023, 58% lower than\nthe first nine months\nof 2022.\n                                              \n  125    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form    \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We\nfund a significant\namount of inventory\nand a portion of\ninvestments on a\nsecured basis. Secured\nfunding includes\ncollateralized\nfinancings in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets. See Note 11 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about our\ncollateralized\nfinancings, including\nits maturity profile.\nWe may also pledge our\ninventory and\ninvestments as\ncollateral for\nsecurities borrowed\nunder a securities\nlending agreement. We\nalso use our own\ninventory and\ninvestments to cover\ntransactions in which\nwe or our clients have\nsold securities that\nhave not yet been\npurchased. Secured\nfunding is less\nsensitive to changes\nin our credit quality\nthan unsecured\nfunding, due to our\nposting of collateral\nto our lenders.\nNonetheless, we\nanalyze the\nrefinancing risk of\nour secured funding\nactivities, taking\ninto account trade\ntenors, maturity\nprofiles, counterparty\nconcentrations,\ncollateral eligibility\nand counterparty\nrollover\nprobabilities. We seek\nto mitigate our\nrefinancing risk by\nexecuting term trades\nwith staggered\nmaturities,\ndiversifying\ncounterparties,\nraising excess secured\nfunding and pre-\nfunding residual risk\nthrough our GCLA. We\nseek to raise secured\nfunding with a term\nappropriate for the\nliquidity of the\nassets that are being\nfinanced, and we seek\nlonger maturities for\nsecured funding\ncollateralized by\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis,\nespecially during\ntimes of market\nstress. Our secured\nfunding, excluding\nfunding collateralized\nby liquid government\nand agency\nobligations, is\nprimarily executed for\ntenors of one month or\ngreater and is\nprimarily executed\nthrough term\nrepurchase agreements\nand securities loaned\ncontracts. Assets that\nmay be harder to fund\non a secured basis\nduring times of market\nstress include certain\nfinancial instruments\nin the following\ncategories: mortgage-\nand other asset-backed\nloans and securities,\nnon-investment-grade\ncorporate debt\nsecurities, equity\nsecurities and\nemerging market\nsecurities. We also\nraise financing\nthrough other types of\ncollateralized\nfinancings, such as\nsecured loans and\nnotes. GS Bank USA has\naccess to funding from\nthe Federal Home Loan\nBank. Our outstanding\nborrowings from the\nFederal Home Loan Bank\nwere $2.00 billion as\nof September 2023 and\nwe had no outstanding\nborrowings as of\nDecember 2022.\nAdditionally, we have\naccess to funding\nthrough the Federal\nReserve discount\nwindow. However, we do\nnot rely on this\nfunding in our\nliquidity planning and\nstress testing.\n\nUnsecured Short-Term\nBorrowings. A\nsignificant portion of\nour unsecured short-\nterm borrowings was\noriginally long-term\ndebt that is scheduled\nto mature within one\nyear of the reporting\ndate. We use unsecured\nshort-term borrowings,\nincluding U.S. and\nnon-U.S. hybrid\nfinancial instruments\nand commercial paper,\nto finance liquid\nassets and for other\ncash management\npurposes.

See Notes 14\nand 19 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\npreferred stock and\nsubordinated debt.\n\nCapital Planning and\nStress Testing\nProcess. As part of\ncapital planning, we\nproject sources and\nuses of capital given\na range of business\nenvironments,\nincluding stressed\nconditions. Our stress\ntesting process is\ndesigned to identify\nand measure material\nrisks associated with\nour business\nactivities, including\nmarket risk, credit\nrisk, operational risk\nand liquidity risk, as\nwell as our ability to\ngenerate revenues.\n\nOur capital planning\nprocess incorporates\nan internal capital\nadequacy assessment\nwith the objective of\nensuring that we are\nappropriately\ncapitalized relative\nto the risks in our\nbusinesses. We\nincorporate stress\nscenarios into our\ncapital planning\nprocess with a goal of\nholding sufficient\ncapital to ensure we\nremain adequately\ncapitalized after\nexperiencing a severe\nstress event. Our\nassessment of capital\nadequacy is viewed in\ntandem with our\nassessment of\nliquidity adequacy and\nis integrated into our\noverall risk\nmanagement structure,\ngovernance and policy\nframework.\n\nOur stress tests\nincorporate our\ninternally designed\nstress scenarios,\nincluding our\ninternally developed\nseverely adverse\nscenario, and those\nrequired by the FRB,\nand are designed to\ncapture our specific\nvulnerabilities and\nrisks. We provide\nfurther information\nabout our stress test\nprocesses and a\nsummary of the results\non our website as\ndescribed in\n\u201cAvailable\nInformation.\u201d\n\nAs required by the\nFRB\u2019s CCAR rules, we\nsubmit an annual\ncapital plan for\nreview by the FRB. The\npurpose of the FRB\u2019s\nreview is to ensure\nthat we have a robust,\nforward-looking\ncapital planning\nprocess that accounts\nfor our unique risks\nand that permits\ncontinued operation\nduring times of\neconomic and financial\nstress.\n\nThe FRB evaluates us\nbased, in part, on\nwhether we have the\ncapital necessary to\ncontinue operating\nunder the baseline and\nseverely adverse\nscenarios provided by\nthe FRB and those\ndeveloped internally.\nThis evaluation also\ntakes into account our\nprocess for\nidentifying risk, our\ncontrols and\ngovernance for capital\nplanning, and our\nguidelines for making\ncapital planning\ndecisions. In\naddition, the FRB\nevaluates our plan to\nmake capital\ndistributions (i.e.,\ndividend payments and\nrepurchases or\nredemptions of stock,\nsubordinated debt or\nother capital\nsecurities) and issue\ncapital, across the\nrange of macroeconomic\nscenarios and firm-\nspecific assumptions.\nThe FRB determines the\nstress capital buffer\n(SCB) applicable to us\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\nThe SCB under the\nStandardized approach\nis calculated as (i)\nthe difference between\nour starting and\nminimum projected CET1\ncapital ratios under\nthe supe rvisory\nseverely adverse\nscenario and (ii) our\nplanned common stock\ndividends for each of\nthe fourth through\nseventh quarters of\nthe planning horizon,\nexpressed as a\npercentage of risk-\nweighted assets\n(RWAs).\n\nBased on our 2023 CCAR\nsubmission, the FRB\nreduced our SCB from\n6.3% to 5.5% for the\nperiod from October 1,\n2023 through September\n30, 2024. As a result,\nbeginning on October\n1, 2023, our\nStandardized CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement is 13.0%.\nSee \u201cShare Repurchase\nProgram\u201d for further\ninformation about\ncommon stock\nrepurchases and\ndividends and\n\u201cConsolidated\nRegulatory Capital\u201d\nfor further\ninformation about the\nglobal systemically\nimportant bank (G-SIB)\nsurcharge.

As part of our\ncomprehensive capital\nmanagement policy, we\nmaintain a contingency\ncapital plan. Our\ncontingency capital\nplan provides a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nperceived or actual\ncapital deficiency,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to,\nidentification of\ndrivers of a capital\ndeficiency, as well as\nmitigants and\npotential actions. It\noutlines the\nappropriate\ncommunication\nprocedures to follow\nduring a crisis\nperiod, including\ninternal dissemination\nof information, as\nwell as timely\ncommunication with\nexternal stakeholders.\n\nCapital Attribution.\nWe assess the capital\nusage of each of our\nbusinesses based on\nour attributed equity\nframework. This\nframework considers\nmany factors,\nincluding our internal\nassessment of risks as\nwell as the regulatory\ncapital requirements\nrelated to our\nbusiness activities.\nThese regulatory\ncapital requirements\ntake into\nconsideration our most\nbinding capital\nconstraints. Our most\nbinding capital\nconstraint is our CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement under the\nStandardized Capital\nRules. This\nrequirement includes\nthe SCB which is\ndetermined by the FRB\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\n\nShare Repurchase\nProgram. We use our\nshare repurchase\nprogram to help\nmaintain the\nappropriate level of\ncommon equity. The\nrepurchase program is\neffected primarily\nthrough regular open-\nmarket purchases\n(which may include\nrepurchase plans\ndesigned to comply\nwith Rule 10b5-1 and\naccelerated share\nrepurchases), the\namounts and timing of\nwhich are determined\nprimarily by our\ncurrent and projected\ncapital position and\nour capital plan\nsubmitted to the FRB\nas part of CCAR. The\namounts and timing of\nthe repurchases may\nalso be influenced by\ngeneral market\nconditions and the\nprevailing price and\ntrading volumes of our\ncommon stock.\n\nDuring the third\nquarter of 2023, we\nreturned a total of\n$2.44 billion to\nshareholders,\nincluding common stock\nrepurchases of $1.50\nbillion and common\nstock dividends of\n$937 million. The\nBoard of Directors of\nGroup Inc. (Board)\napproved an increase\nin our common stock\ndividend from $2.50 to\n$2.75 per share\nbeginning in the third\nquarter of 2023.\nConsistent with our\ncapital management\nphilosophy, we will\ncontinue prioritizing\ndeployment of capital\nfor our clients where\nreturns are attractive\nand distribute any\nexcess capital to\nshareholders through\ndividends and share\nrepurchases. However,\ngiven the uncertainty\nabout the FRB's\nrecently proposed\ncapital rules, we\nexpect to moderate our\nstock repurchase\nlevels in the fourth\nquarter of 2023\nrelative to the third\nquarter of 2023.\n\nIn February 2023, the\nBoard approved a new\nshare repurchase\nprogram authorizing\nrepurchases of up to\n$30 billion (in\naggregate value and\ninclusive of shares\nrepurchased in 2023)\nof our common stock.\nSee \u201cUnregistered\nSales of Equity\nSecurities, Use of\nProceeds, and Issuer\nPurchases of Equity\nSecurities\u201d in Part\nII, Item 2 of this\nForm 10-Q and Note 19\nto the consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about our\nshare repurchase\nprogram, and see above\nfor information about\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess.\n\nEffective January 1,\n2023, a one percent\nnon-deductible federal\nexcise tax (buyback\ntax) applies to the\nfair market value of\ncertain corporate\nshare repurchases. The\nfair market value of\nshare repurchases\nsubject to the tax is\nreduced by the fair\nmarket value of any\nstock issued during\nthe calendar year,\nincluding stock issued\nto employees. The\nbuyback tax did not\nhave a material impact\non our financial\ncondition, results of\noperations or cash\nflows for either the\nthree or nine months\nended September 2023.\n\nResolution Capital\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established a\nResolution Capital\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich is designed to\nensure that our major\nsubsidiaries (GS Bank\nUSA, Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI,\nGSIB, GSBE, Goldman\nSachs Japan Co., Ltd.\n(GSJCL), Goldman Sachs\nAsset Management, L.P.\nand Goldman Sachs\nAsset Management\nInternational) have\naccess to sufficient\nloss-absorbing\ncapacity (in the form\nof equity,\nsubordinated debt and\nunsecured senior debt)\nso that they are able\nto wind down following\na Group Inc.\nbankruptcy filing in\naccordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIn addition, we have\nestablished a triggers\nand alerts framework,\nwhich is designed to\nprovide the Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc.\n\nWe submitted our 2023\nresolution plan in\nJune 2023.

Our\nG-SIB surcharge is\n3.0% for 2023 and\n2024. The G-SIB\nsurcharge and\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer in the\nfuture may differ due\nto additional guidance\nfrom our regulators\nand/or positional\nchanges, and our SCB\nis likely to change\nfrom year to year\nbased on the results\nof the annual\nsupervisory stress\ntests.

These profits\ncontributed approximately 16 basis points to\nthe leverage ratio as of September 2023. GSI\nis a registered swap dealer with the CFTC and\na registered security-based swap dealer with\nthe SEC. As of both September 2023 and\nDecember 2022, GSI was subject to and in\ncompliance with applicable capital\nrequirements for swap dealers and security-\nbased swap dealers. GSI is also subject to a\nminimum requirement for own funds and eligible\nliabilities issued to affiliates. This\nrequirement is subject to a transitional\nperiod which began to phase in from January\n2019 and became fully effective beginning in\nJanuary 2022. As of both September 2023 and\nDecember 2022, GSI was in compliance with this\nrequirement. GSJCL, our Japanese broker-\ndealer, is regulated by Japan\u2019s Financial\nServices Agency. GSJCL and certain other\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to\ncapital requirements promulgated by\nauthorities of the countries in which they\noperate. As of both September 2023 and\nDecember 2022, these subsidiaries were in\ncompliance with their local capital\nrequirements. Regulatory and Other Matters\nRegulatory Matters Our businesses are subject\nto extensive regulation and supervision\nworldwide. Regulations have been adopted or\nare being considered by regulators and policy\nmakers worldwide. Given that many of the new\nand proposed rules are highly complex, the\nfull impact of regulatory reform will not be\nknown until the rules are implemented and\nmarket practices develop under the final\nregulations. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in\nPart I, Item 1 of the 2022 Form 10-K for\nfurther information about the laws, rules and\nregulations and proposed laws, rules and\nregulations that apply to us and our\noperations.\n\nBasel III Reforms. In July 2023, the U.S.\nfederal bank regulatory authorities proposed a\nrule implementing the Basel Committee\u2019s\nfinalization of the post-crisis regulatory\ncapital reforms. The proposed effective date\nis July 1, 2025 with a three-year transition\nperiod for the calculation of Expanded Risk-\nBased Approach RWAs. The proposal includes the\nreplacement of the Advanced Approach with an\nExpanded Risk-Based Approach, which eliminates\nthe use of internal models to calculate RWAs\nfor credit and operational risk. The proposal\nalso provides that stress capital requirements\nthrough the SCB would be applied to Expanded\nRisk-Based Approach capital ratios. The credit\nrisk component of the Expanded Risk-Based\nApproach would include new risk weights for\nmany counterparty and exposure types, a\nrevised collateral haircut approach for\ncertain collateralized transactions and\nadditional restrictions for recognizing\ncollateral in certain securities financing\ntransactions. The operational RWAs are\nproposed to be calculated primarily based on\nrevenues and historical losses. In addition,\nthe proposal includes the Fundamental Review\nof the Trading Book, which replaces the market\nrisk rule for both the Standardized and\nExpanded Risk-Based Approach, and introduces a\nnew credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk RWA\ncalculation for the Expanded Risk-Based\nApproach. Separately, the Federal Reserve also\nproposed a rule to revise the G-SIB surcharge.\nThe proposals are currently open for comment.\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of the\nproposed rules, but we preliminarily estimate\nthat these rules, if adopted as proposed and\nif our assets and liabilities remain largely\nconsistent with those as of September 2023,\nour regulatory capital requirements could\nincrease by approximately 25% on a fully\nphased-in basis. Other Matters Replacement of\nInterbank Offered Rates (IBORs), including\nLIBOR. As of July 1, 2023, the publication of\nall LIBOR settings as representative rates has\nceased. The FCA has allowed the publication\nand use of synthetic rates for certain GBP\nLIBOR settings in legacy GBP LIBOR-based\ncontracts through March 2024 and for certain\nUSD LIBOR settings in legacy USD LIBOR-based\ncontracts through September 2024. We have\nfacilitated an orderly transition from LIBOR\nto alternative risk-free reference rates for\nus and our clients, and our LIBOR-based\nderivative contracts, unsecured benchmark\ndebt, preferred stocks and loans have been\ntransitioned to alternative risk-free\nreference rates in accordance with the\napplicable rules in connection with the\ncessation of LIBOR.\n                                              \n  139    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form    \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Our\ninvolvement in these\narrangements can take\nmany different forms,\nincluding: \u2022\nPurchasing or\nretaining residual and\nother interests in\nspecial purpose\nentities, such as\nmortgage-backed and\nother asset-backed\nsecuritization\nvehicles; \u2022 Holding\nsenior and\nsubordinated debt,\ninterests in limited\nand general\npartnerships, and\npreferred and common\nstock in other\nnonconsolidated\nvehicles; \u2022 Entering\ninto interest rate,\nforeign currency,\nequity, commodity and\ncredit derivatives,\nincluding total return\nswaps; and \u2022 Providing\nguarantees,\nindemnifications,\ncommitments, letters\nof credit and\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. We enter\ninto these\narrangements for a\nvariety of business\npurposes, including\nsecuritizations. The\nsecuritization\nvehicles that purchase\nmortgages, corporate\nbonds and other types\nof financial assets\nare critical to the\nfunctioning of several\nsignificant investor\nmarkets, including the\nmortgage-backed and\nother asset-backed\nsecurities markets,\nsince they offer\ninvestors access to\nspecific cash flows\nand risks created\nthrough the\nsecuritization\nprocess. We also enter\ninto these\narrangements to\nunderwrite client\nsecuritization\ntransactions; provide\nsecondary market\nliquidity; make\ninvestments in\nperforming and\nnonperforming debt,\ndistressed loans,\npower-related assets,\nequity securities,\nreal estate and other\nassets; and provide\ninvestors with credit-\nlinked and asset-\nrepackaged notes.

Overview and Structure of\nRisk Management Overview We believe that\neffective risk management is critical to our\nsuccess. Accordingly, we have established an\nenterprise risk management framework that\nemploys a comprehensive, integrated approach\nto risk management, and is designed to enable\ncomprehensive risk management processes\nthrough which we identify, assess, monitor and\nmanage the risks we assume in conducting our\nactivities. Our risk management structure is\nbuilt around three core components:\ngovernance, processes and people. Governance.\nRisk management governance starts with the\nBoard, which both directly and through its\ncommittees, including its Risk Committee,\noversees our risk management policies and\npractices implemented through the enterprise\nrisk management framework. The Board is also\nresponsible for the annual review and approval\nof our risk appetite statement. The risk\nappetite statement describes the levels and\ntypes of risk we are willing to accept or to\navoid in order to achieve our objectives\nincluded in our strategic business plan, while\nremaining in compliance with regulatory\nrequirements. The Board reviews our strategic\nbusiness plan and is ultimately responsible\nfor overseeing and providing direction about\nour strategy and risk appetite. The Board,\nincluding through its committees, receives\nregular briefings on firmwide risks, including\nliquidity risk, market risk, credit risk,\noperational risk, model risk and climate risk,\nfrom our independent risk oversight and\ncontrol functions, including the chief risk\nofficer, and on compliance risk and conduct\nrisk from the chief compliance officer, on\nlegal and regulatory enforcement matters from\nthe chief legal officer, and on other matters\nimpacting our reputation from the chair and\nvice-chairs of our Firmwide Reputational Risk\nCommittee. The chief risk officer reports to\nour chief executive officer and to the Risk\nCommittee of the Board. As part of the review\nof the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk\nofficer regularly advises the Risk Committee\nof the Board of relevant risk metrics and\nmaterial exposures, including risk limits and\nthresholds established in our risk appetite\nstatement.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form      140  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We believe\nthe identification of\nour risks and related\ncontrol assessment is\na critical step in\nproviding our Board\nand senior management\ntransparency and\ninsight into the range\nand materiality of our\nrisks. We have a\ncomprehensive data\ncollection process,\nincluding firmwide\npolicies and\nprocedures that\nrequire all employees\nto report and escalate\nrisk events. Our\napproach for risk\nidentification and\ncontrol assessment is\ncomprehensive across\nall risk types, is\ndynamic and forward-\nlooking to reflect and\nadapt to our changing\nrisk profile and\nbusiness environment,\nleverages subject\nmatter expertise, and\nallows for\nprioritization of our\nmost critical risks.\nThis approach also\nencompasses our\ncontrol assessment,\nled by our second line\nof defense, to review\nand challenge the\ncontrol environment to\nensure it supports our\nstrategic business\nplan.\n\nTo effectively assess\nour risks, we maintain\na daily discipline of\nmarking substantially\nall of our inventory\nto current market\nlevels. We carry our\ninventory at fair\nvalue, with changes in\nvaluation reflected\nimmediately in our\nrisk management\nsystems and in net\nrevenues. We do so\nbecause we believe\nthis discipline is one\nof the most effective\ntools for assessing\nand managing risk and\nthat it provides\ntransparent and\nrealistic insight into\nour inventory\nexposures.\n\nAn important part of\nour risk management\nprocess is firmwide\nstress testing. It\nallows us to quantify\nour exposure to tail\nrisks, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations,\nundertake risk/reward\nanalysis, and assess\nand mitigate our risk\npositions. Firmwide\nstress tests are\nperformed on a regular\nbasis and are designed\nto ensure a\ncomprehensive analysis\nof our vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic\nrisks combining\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, credit,\nmarket, liquidity and\nfunding, operational\nand compliance,\nstrategic, systemic\nand emerging risks\ninto a single combined\nscenario. We also\nperform ad hoc stress\ntests in anticipation\nof market events or\nconditions. Stress\ntests are also used to\nassess capital\nadequacy as part of\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess. See \u201cCapital\nManagement and\nRegulatory Capital \u2014\nCapital Management\u201d\nfor further\ninformation.\n\n\u2022 Risk Appetite, Limit\nand Threshold Setting.\nWe apply a rigorous\nframework of limits\nand thresholds to\ncontrol and monitor\nrisk across\ntransactions,\nproducts, businesses\nand markets. The\nBoard, directly or\nindirectly through its\nRisk Committee,\napproves limits and\nthresholds included in\nour risk appetite\nstatement at firmwide,\nbusiness and product\nlevels. In addition,\nthe Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee,\nthrough delegated\nauthority from the\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee, is\nresponsible for\napproving our risk\nlimits and thresholds\npolicy, subject to the\noverall limits\napproved by the Risk\nCommittee of the\nBoard, and monitoring\nthese limits.\n\nThe Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee is\nresponsible for\napproving limits at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels.\nCertain limits may be\nset at levels that\nwill require periodic\nadjustment, rather\nthan at levels that\nreflect our maximum\nrisk appetite. This\nfosters an ongoing\ndialogue about risk\namong our first and\nsecond lines of\ndefense, committees\nand senior management,\nas well as rapid\nescalation of risk-\nrelated matters.\nAdditionally, through\ndelegated authority\nfrom the Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee,\nMarket Risk sets\nlimits at certain\nproduct and desk\nlevels, and Credit\nRisk sets limits for\nindividual\ncounterparties and\ntheir subsidiaries,\nindustries and\ncountries. Limits are\nreviewed regularly and\namended on a permanent\nor temporary basis to\nreflect changes to our\nstrategic business\nplan, as well as\nchanging market\nconditions, business\nconditions or risk\ntolerance.\n                                              \n  141    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form    \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Effective\nrisk reporting and\nrisk decision-making\ndepends on our ability\nto get the right\ninformation to the\nright people at the\nright time. As such,\nwe focus on the rigor\nand effectiveness of\nour risk systems, with\nthe objective of\nensuring that our risk\nmanagement technology\nsystems provide us\nwith complete,\naccurate and timely\ninformation. Our risk\nmetrics, reporting and\nmonitoring processes\nare designed to take\ninto account\ninformation about both\nexisting and emerging\nrisks, thereby\nenabling our risk\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement to perform\ntheir responsibilities\nwith the appropriate\nlevel of insight into\nrisk exposures.\nFurthermore, our limit\nand threshold breach\nprocesses provide\nmeans for timely\nescalation. We\nevaluate changes in\nour risk profile and\nour businesses,\nincluding changes in\nbusiness mix or\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate, by\nmonitoring risk\nfactors at a firmwide\nlevel.\n\n\u2022 Risk Decision-\nMaking. Our governance\nstructure provides the\nprotocol and\nresponsibility for\ndecision-making on\nrisk management issues\nand ensures\nimplementation of\nthose decisions. We\nmake extensive use of\nrisk committees that\nmeet regularly and\nserve as an important\nmeans to facilitate\nand foster ongoing\ndiscussions to manage\nand mitigate risks.\n\nWe maintain strong and\nproactive\ncommunication about\nrisk and we have a\nculture of\ncollaboration in\ndecision-making among\nour first and second\nlines of defense,\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement. While our\nfirst line of defense\nis responsible for\nmanagement of their\nrisk, we dedicate\nextensive resources to\nour second line of\ndefense in order to\nensure a strong\noversight structure\nand an appropriate\nsegregation of duties.\nWe regularly reinforce\nour strong culture of\nescalation and\naccountability across\nall functions.\n\nPeople. Even the best\ntechnology serves only\nas a tool for helping\nto make informed\ndecisions in real time\nabout the risks we are\ntaking. Ultimately,\neffective risk\nmanagement requires\nour people to\ninterpret our risk\ndata on an ongoing and\ntimely basis and\nadjust risk positions\naccordingly. The\nexperience of our\nprofessionals, and\ntheir understanding of\nthe nuances and\nlimitations of each\nrisk measure, guides\nus in assessing\nexposures and\nmaintaining them\nwithin prudent levels.\n\nWe reinforce a culture\nof effective risk\nmanagement, consistent\nwith our risk\nappetite, in our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nas well as in the way\nwe evaluate\nperformance, and\nrecognize and reward\nour people. Our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nincluding certain\nsessions led by our\nmost senior leaders,\nare focused on the\nimportance of risk\nmanagement, client\nrelationships and\nreputational\nexcellence. As part of\nour performance review\nprocess, we assess\nreputational\nexcellence, including\nhow an employee\nexercises good risk\nmanagement and\nreputational judgment,\nand adheres to our\ncode of conduct and\ncompliance policies.\nOur review and reward\nprocesses are designed\nto communicate and\nreinforce to our\nprofessionals the link\nbetween behavior and\nhow people are\nrecognized, the need\nto focus on our\nclients and our\nreputation, and the\nneed to always act in\naccordance with our\nhighest standards.\n                                              \n  Structure                                   \n                                              \nUltimate oversight of\nrisk is the\nresponsibility of our\nBoard. The Board\noversees risk both\ndirectly and through\nits committees,\nincluding its Risk\nCommittee. We also\nhave a series of\ncommittees with\nspecific risk\nmanagement mandates\nthat have oversight or\ndecision-making\nresponsibilities for\nrisk management\nactivities. Committee\nmembership generally\nconsists of senior\nmanagers from both our\nfirst and second lines\nof defense. We have\nestablished procedures\nfor these committees\nto ensure that\nappropriate\ninformation barriers\nare in place. Our\nprimary risk\ncommittees, most of\nwhich also have\nadditional sub-\ncommittees, councils\nor working groups, are\ndescribed below. In\naddition to these\ncommittees, we have\nother risk committees\nthat provide oversight\nfor different\nbusinesses,\nactivities, products,\nregions and entities.\nAll of our committees\nhave responsibility\nfor considering the\nimpact on our\nreputation of the\ntransactions and\nactivities that they\noversee.\n\nMembership of our risk\ncommittees is reviewed\nregularly and updated\nto reflect changes in\nthe responsibilities\nof the committee\nmembers. Accordingly,\nthe length of time\nthat members serve on\nthe respective\ncommittees varies as\ndetermined by the\ncommittee chairs and\nbased on the\nresponsibilities of\nthe members.\n\nThe chart below\npresents an overview\nof our risk management\ngovernance structure.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form      142  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

GCLA is\nliquidity that we\nmaintain to meet a\nbroad range of\npotential cash\noutflows and\ncollateral needs in a\nstressed environment.\nA primary liquidity\nprinciple is to pre-\nfund our estimated\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs\nduring a liquidity\ncrisis and hold this\nliquidity in the form\nof unencumbered,\nhighly liquid\nsecurities and cash.\nWe believe that the\nsecurities held in our\nGCLA would be readily\nconvertible to cash in\na matter of days,\nthrough liquidation,\nby entering into\nrepurchase agreements\nor from maturities of\nresale agreements, and\nthat this cash would\nallow us to meet\nimmediate obligations\nwithout needing to\nsell other assets or\ndepend on additional\nfunding from credit-\nsensitive markets.\n\nOur GCLA reflects the\nfollowing principles:\n\n\u2022 The first days or\nweeks of a liquidity\ncrisis are the most\ncritical to a\ncompany\u2019s survival;\n\n\u2022 Focus must be\nmaintained on all\npotential cash and\ncollateral outflows,\nnot just disruptions\nto financing flows.\nOur businesses are\ndiverse, and our\nliquidity needs are\ndetermined by many\nfactors, including\nmarket movements,\ncollateral\nrequirements and\nclient commitments,\nall of which can\nchange dramatically in\na difficult funding\nenvironment;\n\n\u2022 During a liquidity\ncrisis, credit-\nsensitive funding,\nincluding unsecured\ndebt, certain deposits\nand some types of\nsecured financing\nagreements, may be\nunavailable, and the\nterms (e.g., interest\nrates, collateral\nprovisions and tenor)\nor availability of\nother types of secured\nfinancing may change\nand certain deposits\nmay be withdrawn; and\n\n\u2022 As a result of our\npolicy to pre-fund\nliquidity that we\nestimate may be needed\nin a crisis, we hold\nmore unencumbered\nsecurities and have\nlarger funding\nbalances than our\nbusinesses would\notherwise require. We\nbelieve that our\nliquidity is stronger\nwith greater balances\nof highly liquid\nunencumbered\nsecurities, even\nthough it increases\nour total assets and\nour funding costs.\n\nWe maintain our GCLA\nacross Group Inc.,\nGoldman Sachs Funding\nLLC (Funding IHC) and\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries, asset\ntypes and clearing\nagents to provide us\nwith sufficient\noperating liquidity to\nensure timely\nsettlement in all\nmajor markets, even in\na difficult funding\nenvironment.

This enables us\nto determine the most\nappropriate funding\nproducts and tenors.\nSee \u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nBalance Sheet\nManagement\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our balance\nsheet management\nprocess and \u201c\u2014 Funding\nSources \u2014 Secured\nFunding\u201d for further\ninformation about\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis; and\n\n\u2022 Raising secured and\nunsecured financing\nthat has a long tenor\nrelative to the\nliquidity profile of\nour assets. This\nreduces the risk that\nour liabilities will\ncome due in advance of\nour ability to\ngenerate liquidity\nfrom the sale of our\nassets. Because we\nmaintain a highly\nliquid balance sheet,\nthe holding period of\ncertain of our assets\nmay be materially\nshorter than their\ncontractual maturity\ndates.\n\nOur goal is to ensure\nthat we maintain\nsufficient liquidity\nto fund our assets and\nmeet our contractual\nand contingent\nobligations in normal\ntimes, as well as\nduring periods of\nmarket stress. Through\nour dynamic balance\nsheet management\nprocess, we use actual\nand projected asset\nbalances to determine\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding requirements.\nFunding plans are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee.\nIn addition, our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions analyze, and\nthe Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee\nreviews, our\nconsolidated total\ncapital position\n(unsecured long-term\nborrowings plus total\nshareholders\u2019 equity)\nso that we maintain a\nlevel of long-term\nfunding that is\nsufficient to meet our\nlong-term financing\nrequirements. In a\nliquidity crisis, we\nwould first use our\nGCLA in order to avoid\nreliance on asset\nsales (other than our\nGCLA). However, we\nrecognize that orderly\nasset sales may be\nprudent or necessary\nin a severe or\npersistent liquidity\ncrisis.\n                                              \n  145    Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form    \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nSubsidiary Funding\nPolicies\nThe majority of our\nunsecured borrowings\nis raised by Group\nInc., which provides\nthe necessary funds to\nFunding IHC and other\nsubsidiaries, some of\nwhich are regulated,\nto meet their asset\nfinancing, liquidity\nand capital\nrequirements. In\naddition, Group Inc.\nprovides its regulated\nsubsidiaries with the\nnecessary capital to\nmeet their regulatory\nrequirements. The\nbenefits of this\napproach to subsidiary\nfunding are enhanced\ncontrol and greater\nflexibility to meet\nthe funding\nrequirements of our\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nis also raised at the\nsubsidiary level\nthrough a variety of\nproducts, including\ndeposits, secured\nfunding and unsecured\nborrowings.\n\nOur intercompany\nfunding policies\nassume that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s funds or\nsecurities are not\nfreely available to\nits parent, Funding\nIHC or other\nsubsidiaries unless\n(i) legally provided\nfor and (ii) there are\nno additional\nregulatory, tax or\nother restrictions. In\nparticular, many of\nour subsidiaries are\nsubject to laws that\nauthorize regulatory\nbodies to block or\nreduce the flow of\nfunds from those\nsubsidiaries to Group\nInc. or Funding IHC.\nRegulatory action of\nthat kind could impede\naccess to funds that\nGroup Inc. needs to\nmake payments on its\nobligations.\nAccordingly, we assume\nthat the capital\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or other\nsubsidiaries and any\nother financing\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or Funding\nIHC until the maturity\nof such financing.\n\nGroup Inc. has\nprovided substantial\namounts of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness, directly\nor indirectly, to its\nregulated\nsubsidiaries. For\nexample, as of\nSeptember 2023, Group\nInc. had $37.44\nbillion of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness invested\nin GS&Co., its\nprincipal U.S.\nregistered broker-\ndealer; $48.77 billion\ninvested in GSI, a\nregulated U.K. broker-\ndealer; $2.29 billion\ninvested in GSJCL, a\nregulated Japanese\nbroker-dealer; $55.33\nbillion invested in GS\nBank USA, a regulated\nNew York State-\nchartered bank; and\n$4.72 billion invested\nin GSIB, a regulated\nU.K. bank. Group Inc.\nalso provides\nfinancing, directly or\nindirectly, in the\nform of: $96.60\nbillion of\nunsubordinated loans\n(including secured\nloans of $21.11\nbillion) and $43.03\nbillion of collateral\nand cash deposits to\nthese entities as of\nSeptember 2023. In\naddition, as of\nSeptember 2023, Group\nInc. had significant\namounts of capital\ninvested in and loans\nto its other regulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nContingency Funding\nPlan. We maintain a\ncontingency funding\nplan to provide a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nliquidity crisis\nsituation or periods\nof market stress. Our\ncontingency funding\nplan outlines a list\nof potential risk\nfactors, key reports\nand metrics that are\nreviewed on an ongoing\nbasis to assist in\nassessing the severity\nof, and managing\nthrough, a liquidity\ncrisis and/or market\ndislocation. The\ncontingency funding\nplan also describes in\ndetail our potential\nresponses if our\nassessments indicate\nthat we have entered a\nliquidity crisis,\nwhich include pre-\nfunding for what we\nestimate will be our\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs, as\nwell as utilizing\nsecondary sources of\nliquidity. Mitigants\nand action items to\naddress specific risks\nwhich may arise are\nalso described and\nassigned to\nindividuals\nresponsible for\nexecution.\n\nThe contingency\nfunding plan\nidentifies key groups\nof individuals and\ntheir\nresponsibilities,\nwhich include\nfostering effective\ncoordination, control\nand distribution of\ninformation,\nimplementing liquidity\nmaintenance activities\nand managing internal\nand external\ncommunication, all of\nwhich are critical in\nthe management of a\ncrisis or period of\nmarket stress.\nStress Tests\nIn order to determine\nthe appropriate size\nof our GCLA, we model\nliquidity outflows\nover a range of\nscenarios and time\nhorizons. One of our\nprimary internal\nliquidity risk models,\nreferred to as the\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow, quantifies\nour liquidity risks\nover a 30-day stress\nscenario. We also\nconsider other\nfactors, including,\nbut not limited to, an\nassessment of our\npotential intraday\nliquidity needs\nthrough an additional\ninternal liquidity\nrisk model, referred\nto as the Intraday\nLiquidity Model, the\nresults of our long-\nterm stress testing\nmodels, our resolution\nliquidity models and\nother applicable\nregulatory\nrequirements and a\nqualitative assessment\nof our condition, as\nwell as the financial\nmarkets. The results\nof the Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow, the\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel, the long-term\nstress testing models\nand the resolution\nliquidity models are\nreported to senior\nmanagement on a\nregular basis. We also\nperform firmwide\nstress tests.

Our Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow is\nbased on conducting\nmultiple scenarios\nthat include\ncombinations of\nmarket-wide and firm-\nspecific stress. These\nscenarios are\ncharacterized by the\nfollowing qualitative\nelements:\n\n\u2022 Severely challenged\nmarket environments,\nwhich include low\nconsumer and corporate\nconfidence, financial\nand political\ninstability, and\nadverse changes in\nmarket values,\nincluding potential\ndeclines in equity\nmarkets and widening\nof credit spreads; and\n\n\u2022 A firm-specific\ncrisis potentially\ntriggered by material\nlosses, reputational\ndamage, litigation\nand/or a ratings\ndowngrade.\n\nThe following are key\nmodeling elements of\nour Modeled Liquidity\nOutflow:\n\n\u2022 Liquidity needs over\na 30-day scenario;\n\n\u2022 A two-notch\ndowngrade of our long-\nterm senior unsecured\ncredit ratings;\n\n\u2022 Changing conditions\nin funding markets,\nwhich limit our access\nto unsecured and\nsecured funding;\n\n\u2022 No support from\nadditional government\nfunding facilities.\nAlthough we have\naccess to various\ncentral bank funding\nprograms, we do not\nassume reliance on\nadditional sources of\nfunding in a liquidity\ncrisis; and\n\n\u2022 A combination of\ncontractual outflows\nand contingent\noutflows arising from\nboth our on- and off-\nbalance sheet\narrangements.\nContractual outflows\ninclude, among other\nthings, upcoming\nmaturities of\nunsecured debt, term\ndeposits and secured\nfunding. Contingent\noutflows include,\namong other things,\nthe withdrawal of\ncustomer credit\nbalances in our prime\nbrokerage business,\nincrease in variation\nmargin requirements\ndue to adverse changes\nin the value of our\nexchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared\nderivatives, draws on\nunfunded commitments\nand withdrawals of\ndeposits that have no\ncontractual maturity.\nSee notes to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\ncontractual outflows,\nincluding Note 11 for\ncollateralized\nfinancings, Note 13\nfor deposits, Note 14\nfor unsecured long-\nterm borrowings and\nNote 15 for operating\nlease payments, and\n\u201cOff-Balance Sheet\nArrangements\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our various\ntypes of off-balance\nsheet arrangements.\n\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel. Our Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nmeasures our intraday\nliquidity needs in a\nscenario where access\nto sources of intraday\nliquidity may become\nconstrained. The\nintraday liquidity\nmodel considers a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding historical\nsettlement activity.\n\nLong-Term Stress\nTesting. We utilize\nlonger-term stress\ntests to take a\nforward view on our\nliquidity position\nthrough prolonged\nstress periods in\nwhich we experience a\nsevere liquidity\nstress and recover in\nan environment that\ncontinues to be\nchallenging. We are\nfocused on ensuring\nconservative asset-\nliability management\nto prepare for a\nprolonged period of\npotential stress,\nseeking to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nResolution Liquidity\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established our\nResolution Liquidity\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich estimates\nliquidity needs of our\nmajor subsidiaries in\na stressed\nenvironment. The\nliquidity needs are\nmeasured using our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow assumptions\nand include certain\nadditional inter-\naffiliate exposures.\nWe have also\nestablished our\nResolution Liquidity\nExecution Need\nframework, which\nmeasures the liquidity\nneeds of our major\nsubsidiaries to\nstabilize and wind\ndown following a Group\nInc. bankruptcy filing\nin accordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIn addition, we have\nestablished a triggers\nand alerts framework,\nwhich is designed to\nprovide the Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc.\n                                              \n  Limits                                      \n                                              \nWe use liquidity risk\nlimits at various\nlevels and across\nliquidity risk types\nto manage the size of\nour liquidity\nexposures. Limits are\nmeasured relative to\nacceptable levels of\nrisk given our\nliquidity risk\ntolerance. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess.\n\nLimits are monitored\nby Treasury and\nLiquidity Risk.\nLiquidity Risk is\nresponsible for\nidentifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded.\n                                              \n  GCLA and Unencumbered Metrics               \n                                              \nGCLA.

We\nmonitor local\nregulatory liquidity\nrequirements of our\nsubsidiaries to ensure\ncompliance. For many\nof our subsidiaries,\nthese requirements\neither have changed or\nare likely to change\nin the future due to\nthe implementation of\nthe Basel Committee\u2019s\nframework for\nliquidity risk\nmeasurement, standards\nand monitoring, as\nwell as other\nregulatory\ndevelopments. The\nimplementation of\nthese rules and any\namendments adopted by\nthe regulatory\nauthorities could\nimpact our liquidity\nand funding\nrequirements and\npractices in the\nfuture.\n\nCredit Ratings We rely\non the short- and\nlong-term debt capital\nmarkets to fund a\nsignificant portion of\nour day-to-day\noperations, and the\ncost and availability\nof debt financing is\ninfluenced by our\ncredit ratings.

Certain of our derivatives have\nbeen transacted under bilateral agreements\nwith counterparties who may require us to post\ncollateral or terminate the transactions based\non changes in our credit ratings. We manage\nour GCLA to ensure we would, among other\npotential requirements, be able to make the\nadditional collateral or termination payments\nthat may be required in the event of a two-\nnotch reduction in our long-term credit\nratings, as well as collateral that has not\nbeen called by counterparties, but is\navailable to them. See Note 7 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about derivatives with credit-\nrelated contingent features and the additional\ncollateral or termination payments related to\nour net derivative liabilities under bilateral\nagreements that could have been called by\ncounterparties in the event of a one- or two-\nnotch downgrade in our credit ratings.\n\nCash Flows As a global financial institution,\nour cash flows are complex and bear little\nrelation to our net earnings and net assets.\nConsequently, we believe that traditional cash\nflow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating\nour liquidity position than the liquidity and\nasset-liability management policies described\nabove. Cash flow analysis may, however, be\nhelpful in highlighting certain macro trends\nand strategic initiatives in our businesses.\nNine Months Ended September 2023 . Our cash\nand cash equivalents decreased by $1.95\nbillion to $239.88 billion at the end of the\nthird quarter of 2023, primarily due to net\ncash used for investing activities and the\neffect of exchange rate changes on cash and\ncash equivalents, partially offset by net cash\nprovided by operating activities. The net cash\nused for investing activities primarily\nreflected net purchases of investments\n(primarily U.S. government obligations\naccounted for as held-to-maturity securities).\nThe decrease in net cash and cash equivalents\nas a result of changes in foreign exchange\nrates was due to the U.S. dollar strengthening\nduring the first nine months of 2023. The net\ncash provided by operating activities\nprimarily reflected cash inflows from\ncollateralized transactions (reflecting both\nan increase in collateralized financings and a\ndecrease in collateralized agreements),\npartially offset by cash outflows from trading\nassets. Nine Months Ended September 2022 . Our\ncash and cash equivalents increased by $23.22\nbillion to $284.25 billion at the end of the\nthird quarter of 2022, due to net cash\nprovided by financing and operating\nactivities, partially offset by net cash used\nfor investing activities and the effect of\nexchange rate changes on cash and cash\nequivalents. The net cash provided by\nfinancing activities primarily reflected cash\ninflows from deposits (reflecting increases in\ntransaction banking, deposit sweep program\nbalances, brokered certificates of deposit,\nand consumer deposits, partially offset by a\ndecrease in other deposits) and net issuance\nof unsecured long-term borrowings. The net\ncash provided by operating activities\nprimarily reflected cash inflows from trading\nliabilities and customer and other receivables\nand payables, net (reflecting both an increase\nin customer and other payables and in customer\nand other receivables), partially offset by\ncash outflows from trading assets. The net\ncash used for investing activities primarily\nreflected purchases of investments (primarily\nU.S. government obligations accounted for as\nheld-to-maturity) and an increase in net\nlending activities (reflecting increases in\ncorporate, consumer and wealth management\nloans). The decrease in net cash and cash\nequivalents as a result of changes in foreign\nexchange rates was due to the U.S. dollar\nstrengthening during the first nine months of\n2022.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form      150  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Inherent\nlimitations to VaR\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 VaR does not\nestimate potential\nlosses over longer\ntime horizons where\nmoves may be extreme;\n\n\u2022 VaR does not take\naccount of the\nrelative liquidity of\ndifferent risk\npositions; and\n\n\u2022 Previous moves in\nmarket risk factors\nmay not produce\naccurate predictions\nof all future market\nmoves.\n\nTo comprehensively\ncapture our exposures\nand relevant risks in\nour VaR calculation,\nwe use historical\nsimulations with full\nvaluation of market\nfactors at the\nposition level by\nsimultaneously\nshocking the relevant\nmarket factors for\nthat position. These\nmarket factors include\nspot prices, credit\nspreads, funding\nspreads, yield curves,\nvolatility and\ncorrelation, and are\nupdated periodically\nbased on changes in\nthe composition of\npositions, as well as\nvariations in market\nconditions. We sample\nfrom five years of\nhistorical data to\ngenerate the scenarios\nfor our VaR\ncalculation. The\nhistorical data is\nweighted so that the\nrelative importance of\nthe data reduces over\ntime. This gives\ngreater importance to\nmore recent\nobservations and\nreflects current asset\nvolatilities, which\nimproves the accuracy\nof our estimates of\npotential loss. As a\nresult, even if our\npositions included in\nVaR were unchanged,\nour VaR would increase\nwith increasing market\nvolatility and vice\nversa.\n\nGiven its reliance on\nhistorical data, VaR\nis most effective in\nestimating risk\nexposures in markets\nin which there are no\nsudden fundamental\nchanges or shifts in\nmarket conditions.\n\nOur VaR measure does\nnot include:\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nnot accounted for at\nfair value, such as\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities and loans,\ndeposits and unsecured\nborrowings that are\naccounted for at\namortized cost;\n\n\u2022 Available-for-sale\nsecurities for which\nthe related unrealized\nfair value gains and\nlosses are included in\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss);\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nbest measured and\nmonitored using\nsensitivity measures;\nand\n\n\u2022 The impact of\nchanges in\ncounterparty and our\nown credit spreads on\nderivatives, as well\nas changes in our own\ncredit spreads on\nfinancial liabilities\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected.\n\nWe perform daily\nbacktesting of our VaR\nmodel (i.e., comparing\ndaily net revenues for\npositions included in\nVaR to the VaR measure\ncalculated as of the\nprior business day) at\nthe firmwide level and\nfor each of our\nbusinesses and major\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nEarnings-at-Risk. We\nmanage our interest\nrate risk using the\nEaR metric. EaR\nmeasures the estimated\nimpact of changes in\ninterest rates to our\nnet revenues and\npreferred stock\ndividends over a\ndefined time horizon.\nEaR complements the\nVaR metric, which\nmeasures the impact of\ninterest rate changes\nthat have an immediate\nimpact on the fair\nvalues of our assets\nand liabilities (i.e.,\nmark-to-market\nchanges). Our exposure\nto interest rate risk\noccurs due to a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to:\n\n\u2022 Differences in\nmaturity or repricing\ndates of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock and certain off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments.\n\n\u2022 Differences in the\namounts of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock and certain off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments with the\nsame maturity or\nrepricing dates.\n\n\u2022 Certain interest\nrate sensitive fees.\n\nTreasury manages the\naggregated interest\nrate risk from all\nbusinesses through our\ninvestment securities\nportfolio and interest\nrate derivatives. We\nmeasure EaR over a\none-year time horizon\nfollowing a 100-basis\npoint instantaneous\nparallel shock in both\nshort- and long-term\ninterest rates. This\nsensitivity is\ncalculated relative to\na baseline market\nscenario, which takes\ninto consideration,\namong other things,\nthe market\u2019s\nexpectation of forward\nrates, as well as our\nexpectation of future\nbusiness activity.\nThis scenario includes\ncontractual elements\nof assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock, and certain\noff-balance sheet\ninstruments, such as\nrates of interest,\nprincipal repayment\nschedules, maturity\nand reset dates, and\nany interest rate\nceilings or floors, as\nwell as assumptions\nwith respect to our\nbalance sheet size and\ncomposition, deposit\nrepricing and\nprepayment behavior.\nWe manage EaR with a\ngoal to reduce\npotential volatility\nresulting from changes\nin interest rates so\nit remains within our\nEaR risk appetite. Our\nEaR scenario is\nregularly evaluated\nand updated, if\nnecessary, to reflect\nchanges in our\nbusiness plans, market\nconditions and other\nmacroeconomic factors.\nWhile management uses\nthe best information\navailable to estimate\nEaR, actual results\nmay differ materially\nas a result of, among\nother things, changes\nin the economic\nenvironment or\nassumptions used in\nthe process.\n\nRisk, which is\nindependent of our\nrevenue-producing\nunits, and Treasury,\nhave primary\nresponsibility for\nassessing and\nmonitoring EaR through\nfirmwide oversight,\nincluding oversight of\nEaR stress testing and\nassumptions, and the\nestablishment of our\nEaR risk appetite.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form      152  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Stress\ntesting is a method of\ndetermining the effect\nof various\nhypothetical stress\nscenarios. In addition\nto EaR, we use other\nstress tests to\nexamine risks of\nspecific portfolios,\nas well as the\npotential impact of\nour significant risk\nexposures. We use a\nvariety of stress\ntesting techniques to\ncalculate the\npotential loss from a\nwide range of market\nmoves on our\nportfolios, including\nfirmwide stress tests,\nsensitivity analysis\nand scenario analysis.\nThe results of our\nvarious stress tests\nare analyzed together\nfor risk management\npurposes. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\nSensitivity analysis\nis used to quantify\nthe impact of a market\nmove in a single risk\nfactor across all\npositions (e.g.,\nequity prices or\ncredit spreads) using\na variety of defined\nmarket shocks, ranging\nfrom those that could\nbe expected over a\none-day time horizon\nup to those that could\ntake many months to\noccur. We also use\nsensitivity analysis\nto quantify the impact\nof the default of any\nsingle entity, which\ncaptures the risk of\nlarge or concentrated\nexposures. Scenario\nanalysis is used to\nquantify the impact of\na specified event,\nincluding how the\nevent impacts multiple\nrisk factors\nsimultaneously. For\nexample, for sovereign\nstress testing we\ncalculate potential\ndirect exposure\nassociated with our\nsovereign positions,\nas well as the\ncorresponding debt,\nequity and currency\nexposures associated\nwith our non-sovereign\npositions that may be\nimpacted by the\nsovereign distress.\nWhen conducting\nscenario analysis, we\noften consider a\nnumber of possible\noutcomes for each\nscenario, ranging from\nmoderate to severely\nadverse market\nimpacts. In addition,\nthese stress tests are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical events and\nforward-looking\nhypothetical\nscenarios. Unlike VaR\nmeasures, which have\nan implied probability\nbecause they are\ncalculated at a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, there may not\nbe an implied\nprobability that our\nstress testing\nscenarios will occur.\nInstead, stress\ntesting is used to\nmodel both moderate\nand more extreme moves\nin underlying market\nfactors. When\nestimating potential\nloss, we generally\nassume that our\npositions cannot be\nreduced or hedged\n(although experience\ndemonstrates that we\nare generally able to\ndo so). Limits We use\nmarket risk limits at\nvarious levels to\nmanage the size of our\nmarket exposures.\nThese limits are set\nbased on VaR, EaR and\non a range of stress\ntests relevant to our\nexposures. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess.\n\nLimits are monitored\nby Treasury and Risk.\nRisk is responsible\nfor identifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded (e.g., due to\npositional changes or\nchanges in market\nconditions, such as\nincreased volatilities\nor changes in\ncorrelations). Such\ninstances are\nremediated by a\nreduction in the\npositions we hold\nand/or a temporary or\npermanent increase to\nthe limit, if\nwarranted. Metrics We\nanalyze VaR at the\nfirmwide level and a\nvariety of more\ndetailed levels,\nincluding by risk\ncategory, business and\nregion.\nDiversification effect\nin the tables below\nrepresents the\ndifference between\ntotal VaR and the sum\nof the VaRs for the\nfour risk categories.\nThis effect arises\nbecause the four\nmarket risk categories\nare not perfectly\ncorrelated. During the\nfirst quarter of 2023,\nwe added the currency\nexposure on certain\ndebt and equity\npositions to VaR and\nremoved certain debt\nand equity positions\n(and related hedges)\nfrom VaR as our\nmanagement believes\nthat the risk of these\npositions is more\nappropriately measured\nand monitored using\n10% sensitivity\nmeasures.

Credit Risk Management Overview Credit\nrisk represents the potential for loss due to\nthe default or deterioration in credit quality\nof a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives\ncounterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of\nsecurities or other instruments we hold. Our\nexposure to credit risk comes mostly from\nclient transactions in OTC derivatives and\nloans and lending commitments. Credit risk\nalso comes from cash placed with banks,\nsecurities financing transactions (i.e.,\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending activities)\nand customer and other receivables.\n\nCredit Risk, which is independent of our\nrevenue-producing units and reports to our\nchief risk officer, has primary responsibility\nfor assessing, monitoring and managing our\ncredit risk through firmwide oversight across\nour global businesses. In addition, we hold\nother positions that give rise to credit risk\n(e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These\ncredit risks are captured as a component of\nmarket risk measures, which are monitored and\nmanaged by Market Risk. We also enter into\nderivatives to manage market risk exposures.\nSuch derivatives also give rise to credit\nrisk, which is monitored and managed by Credit\nRisk. Credit Risk Management Process Our\nprocess for managing credit risk includes the\ncritical components of our risk management\nframework described in the \u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk Management,\u201d as well as the\nfollowing: \u2022 Monitoring compliance with\nestablished credit risk limits and reporting\nour credit exposures and credit\nconcentrations; \u2022 Establishing or approving\nunderwriting standards; \u2022 Assessing the\nlikelihood that a counterparty will default on\nits payment obligations; \u2022 Measuring our\ncurrent and potential credit exposure and\nlosses resulting from a counterparty default;\n\u2022 Using credit risk mitigants, including\ncollateral and hedging; and \u2022 Maximizing\nrecovery through active workout and\nrestructuring of claims. We also perform\ncredit analyses, which incorporate initial and\nongoing evaluations of the capacity and\nwillingness of a counterparty to meet its\nfinancial obligations. For substantially all\nof our credit exposures, the core of our\nprocess is an annual counterparty credit\nevaluation or more frequently if deemed\nnecessary as a result of events or changes in\ncircumstances. We determine an internal credit\nrating for the counterparty by considering the\nresults of the credit evaluations and\nassumptions with respect to the nature of and\noutlook for the counterparty\u2019s industry and\nthe economic environment. Beginning in the\nfirst quarter of 2023, we also take into\nconsideration collateral received or other\ncredit support arrangements when determining\nan internal credit rating for collateralized\nloans, as management believes that this\nmethodology better reflects the credit quality\nof the underlying loans and lending\ncommitments. Prior period amounts have been\nconformed to reflect the current methodology.\nSenior personnel, with expertise in specific\nindustries, inspect and approve credit reviews\nand internal credit ratings. Our risk\nassessment process may also include, where\napplicable, reviewing certain key metrics,\nincluding, but not limited to, delinquency\nstatus, collateral value, FICO credit scores\nand other risk factors.\n                                              \n  Goldman Sachs September 2023 Form      156  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These shocks\ncover a wide range of\nmoderate and more\nextreme market\nmovements, including\nshocks to multiple\nrisk factors,\nconsistent with the\noccurrence of a severe\nmarket or economic\nevent. In the case of\nsovereign default, we\nestimate the direct\nimpact of the default\non our sovereign\ncredit exposures,\nchanges to our credit\nexposures arising from\npotential market moves\nin response to the\ndefault, and the\nimpact of credit\nmarket deterioration\non corporate borrowers\nand counterparties\nthat may result from\nthe sovereign default.\nUnlike potential\nexposure, which is\ncalculated within a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, stress testing\ndoes not generally\nassume a probability\nof these events\noccurring. We also\nperform firmwide\nstress tests. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\n\nTo supplement these\nregular stress tests,\nas described above, we\nalso conduct tailored\nstress tests on an ad\nhoc basis in response\nto specific market\nevents that we deem\nsignificant. We also\nutilize these stress\ntests to estimate the\nindirect impact of\ncertain hypothetical\nevents on our country\nexposures, such as the\nimpact of credit\nmarket deterioration\non corporate borrowers\nand counterparties\nalong with the shocks\nto the risk factors\ndescribed above. The\nparameters of these\nshocks vary based on\nthe scenario reflected\nin each stress test.\nWe review estimated\nlosses produced by the\nstress tests in order\nto understand their\nmagnitude, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations, and\nassess and mitigate\nour exposures where\nnecessary.\n                                              \n  Limits                                      \n                                              \nWe use credit risk\nlimits at various\nlevels, as well as\nunderwriting standards\nto manage the size and\nnature of our credit\nexposures.

We may\nalso reduce credit\nrisk with\ncounterparties by\nentering into\nagreements that enable\nus to obtain\ncollateral from them\non an upfront or\ncontingent basis\nand/or to terminate\ntransactions if the\ncounterparty\u2019s credit\nrating falls below a\nspecified level.

As credit\nrisk is an essential\ncomponent of fair\nvalue, we include a\nCVA in the fair value\nof derivatives to\nreflect counterparty\ncredit risk, as\ndescribed in Note 7 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nCVA is a function of\nthe present value of\nexpected exposure, the\nprobability of\ncounterparty default\nand the assumed\nrecovery upon default.\nThe table below\npresents our net\ncredit exposure from\nOTC derivatives and\nthe concentration by\nindustry and region.\n                                              \n              As of                           \n                     Septem\u2026    Decem\u2026        \n  $ in                  2023            2022  \n  milli\u2026                                      \n  OTC                                         \n  deriv\u2026    $45,500             $53,3\u2026        \n  assets                                      \n  Colla\u2026                                      \n  (not                                        \n  netted    -16,386             -15,8\u2026        \n  under                                       \n  U.S.                                        \n  GAAP)                                       \n  Net                                         \n  credit    $29,114             $37,5\u2026        \n  expos\u2026                                      \n  Indus\u2026                                      \n  Consu\u2026                                      \n  &               3        %         3     %  \n  Retail                                      \n  Diver\u2026         13        %         8     %  \n  Indus\u2026                                      \n  Finan\u2026         16        %        20     %  \n  Insti\u2026                                      \n  Funds          24        %        19     %  \n  Healt\u2026          1        %         1     %  \n  Munic\u2026                                      \n  &               2        %         2     %  \n  Nonpr\u2026                                      \n  Natur\u2026                                      \n  Resou\u2026         21        %        34     %  \n  &                                           \n  Utili\u2026                                      \n  Sover\u2026         12        %         7     %  \n  Techn\u2026                                      \n  Media           6        %         4     %  \n  &                                           \n  Telec\u2026                                      \n  Other                                       \n  (incl\u2026                                      \n  Speci\u2026          2        %         2     %  \n  Purpo\u2026                                      \n  Vehic\u2026                                      \n  Total         100        %       100     %  \n  Region                                      \n  Ameri\u2026         46        %        49     %  \n  EMEA           46        %        43     %  \n  Asia            8        %         8     %  \n  Total         100        %       100     %  \n                                              \nOur credit exposure\n(before any potential\nrecoveries) to OTC\nderivative\ncounterparties that\ndefaulted during the\nnine months ended\nSeptember 2023\nremained low,\nrepresenting less than\n2% of our total credit\nexposure from OTC\nderivatives.

Our risk\nassessment process for\nsuch loans includes\nreviewing certain key\nmetrics, such as\nexpected cash flows,\ndelinquency status and\nother risk factors. In\naddition, we also have\ncredit exposure to\nother loans held for\nsecuritization of\n$1.31 billion as of\nSeptember 2023 and\n$1.76 billion as of\nDecember 2022. Such\nloans are included in\ntrading assets in our\nconsolidated balance\nsheets. Credit Hedges.\nTo mitigate the credit\nrisk associated with\nour lending\nactivities, we obtain\ncredit protection on\ncertain loans and\nlending commitments\nthrough credit default\nswaps, both single-\nname and index-based\ncontracts, and through\nthe issuance of\ncredit-linked notes.\n\nSecurities Financing\nTransactions. We enter\ninto securities\nfinancing transactions\nin order to, among\nother things,\nfacilitate client\nactivities, invest\nexcess cash, acquire\nsecurities to cover\nshort positions and\nfinance certain\nactivities. We bear\ncredit risk related to\nresale agreements and\nsecurities borrowed\nonly to the extent\nthat cash advanced or\nthe value of\nsecurities pledged or\ndelivered to the\ncounterparty exceeds\nthe value of the\ncollateral received.\nWe also have credit\nexposure on repurchase\nagreements and\nsecurities loaned to\nthe extent that the\nvalue of securities\npledged or delivered\nto the counterparty\nfor these transactions\nexceeds the amount of\ncash or collateral\nreceived. Securities\ncollateral for these\ntransactions primarily\nincludes U.S. and\nnon-U.S. government\nand agency\nobligations.

We are\nexposed to credit risk\nfrom our receivables\nfrom brokers, dealers\nand clearing\norganizations and\ncustomers and\ncounterparties.\nReceivables from\nbrokers, dealers and\nclearing organizations\nprimarily consist of\ninitial margin placed\nwith clearing\norganizations and\nreceivables related to\nsales of securities\nwhich have traded, but\nnot yet settled. These\nreceivables generally\nhave minimal credit\nrisk due to the low\nprobability of\nclearing organization\ndefault and the short-\nterm nature of\nreceivables related to\nsecurities\nsettlements.\nReceivables from\ncustomers and\ncounterparties\ngenerally consist of\ncollateralized\nreceivables related to\ncustomer securities\ntransactions and\ngenerally have minimal\ncredit risk due to\nboth the value of the\ncollateral received\nand the short-term\nnature of these\nreceivables.

Credit exposure represents\nthe potential for loss due to the default or\ndeterioration in credit quality of a\ncounterparty or borrower. Market exposure\nrepresents the potential for loss in value of\nour long and short positions due to changes in\nmarket prices.\n\nCountry Exposures. The Russian invasion of\nUkraine has negatively affected the global\neconomy and increased macroeconomic\nuncertainty. The extent and duration of the\nwar, sanctions and resulting market\ndisruptions, as well as the potential adverse\nconsequences for our business, liquidity and\nresults of operations, are difficult to\npredict. We have significantly reduced our\nexposure to Russia and Ukraine and have\ncurtailed our operations in Russia to those\nnecessary to meet our legal and regulatory\nobligations. The overall direct financial\nimpact to our net revenues for the first nine\nmonths of 2023 from Russian and Ukrainian\ncounterparties, borrowers, issuers and related\ninstruments was not material. Our total credit\nexposure to Russian or Ukrainian\ncounterparties or borrowers and our total\nmarket exposure relating to Russian issuers\nwas not material as of September 2023. Our\ntotal market exposure to Ukraine as of\nSeptember 2023 was $113 million, primarily to\nsovereign issuers. Such exposure consisted of\n$125 million related to debt and $(12) million\nrelated to credit derivatives. See \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form\n10-K for further information about our risks\nrelated to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nEconomic challenges persist for the Argentine\ngovernment given uncertainty relating to its\nfiscal and economic policies. As of September\n2023 , our total credit exposure to Argentina\nwas not material. Our total market exposure to\nArgentina as of September 2023 was $172\nmillion, primarily to sovereign issuers. Such\nexposure consisted of $94 million related to\ndebt, $7 million related to credit derivatives\nand $71 million related to equities. In\naddition, economic and/or political unc\nertainties in Ethiopia, Ghana, Lebanon,\nPakistan, Sri Lanka and Venezuela have led to\nconcerns about their financial stability. Our\ncredit exposure to counterparties or borrowers\nand our market exposure to issuers relating to\neach of these countries was not material as of\nSeptember 2023. We have a comprehensive\nframework to monitor, measure and assess our\ncountry exposures and to determine our risk\nappetite. We determine the country of risk by\nthe location of the counterparty, issuer\u2019s\nassets, where they generate revenue, the\ncountry in which they are headquartered, the\njurisdiction where a claim against them could\nbe enforced, and/or the government whose\npolicies affect their ability to repay their\nobligations.

In  \u2502\n\u2502  addition, no change in our internal       \u2502\n\u2502  control over financial reporting (as      \u2502\n\u2502  defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the       \u2502\n\u2502  Exchange Act) occurred during the         \u2502\n\u2502  quarter ended September 2023 that has     \u2502\n\u2502  materially affected, or is reasonably     \u2502\n\u2502  likely to materially affect, our          \u2502\n\u2502  internal control over financial           \u2502\n\u2502  reporting.                                \u2502\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  PART II. OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1. Legal   \u2502\n\u2502  ProceedingsWe are involved in a number    \u2502\n\u2502  of judicial, regulatory and arbitration   \u2502\n\u2502  proceedings concerning matters arising    \u2502\n\u2502  in connection with the conduct of our     \u2502\n\u2502  businesses. Many of these proceedings     \u2502\n\u2502  are in early stages, and many of these    \u2502\n\u2502  cases seek an indeterminate amount of     \u2502\n\u2502  damages. We have estimated the upper end  \u2502\n\u2502  of the range of reasonably possible       \u2502\n\u2502  aggregate loss for matters where we have  \u2502\n\u2502  been able to estimate a range and we      \u2502\n\u2502  believe, based on currently available     \u2502\n\u2502  information, that the results of matters  \u2502\n\u2502  where we have not been able to estimate   \u2502\n\u2502  a range of reasonably possible loss, in   \u2502\n\u2502  the aggregate, will not have a material   \u2502\n\u2502  adverse effect on our financial           \u2502\n\u2502  condition, but may be material to our     \u2502\n\u2502  operating results in a given period.      \u2502\n\u2502  Given the range of litigation and         \u2502\n\u2502  investigations presently under way, our   \u2502\n\u2502  litigation expenses may remain high.
