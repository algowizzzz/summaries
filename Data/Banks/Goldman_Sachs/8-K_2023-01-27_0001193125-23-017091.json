This\ncompares to Mr. Solomon\u2019s total annual\ncompensation for 2021 of $35 million.\n\nThe Compensation Committee was guided in its\ndetermination of 2022 compensation by, among\nother things, the firm\u2019s Performance\nAssessment Framework, which is comprised of\nidentified financial performance metrics as\nwell as non-financial factors (i.e., client\norientation; risk management; and people\nstrategy scorecard).\n\nIn making its determinations, the Compensation\nCommittee considered, among other things, the\nfirm\u2019s 2022 performance, both on an absolute\nbasis and relative to peer results, as well as\nin comparison to the record performance\ndelivered in 2021. The Committee also took\ninto account the firm\u2019s continued progress in\nits strategic evolution as well as Mr.\nSolomon\u2019s strong individual performance and\neffective leadership. These factors were\nconsidered in the context of a challenging\noperating environment.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the\nRegistrant reported its second highest full-\nyear net revenues of $47.4 billion, net\nearnings of $11.3 billion, its second highest\ndiluted earnings per common share of $30.06\nand return on average common shareholders\u2019\nequity of 10.2%.
