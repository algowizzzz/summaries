AND\nSUBSIDIARIES\n\nSustainability\nWe have a long-\nstanding commitment to\nsustainability. Our\ntwo priorities in this\narea are helping\nclients across\nindustries decarbonize\ntheir businesses to\nsupport their\ntransition to a low-\ncarbon economy\n(Climate Transition)\nand to advance\nsolutions that expand\naccess, increase\naffordability, and\ndrive outcomes to\nsupport sustainable\neconomic growth\n(Inclusive Growth).\nOur strategy is to\nadvance these two\npriorities through our\nwork with our clients,\nand with strategic\npartners whose\nstrengths and areas of\nfocus complement our\nown, as well as\nthrough our supply\nchain.\n\nWe have established a\nSustainable Finance\nGroup, which serves as\nthe centralized group\nthat drives climate\nstrategy and\nsustainability efforts\nacross our firm,\nincluding commercial\nefforts alongside our\nbusinesses, to advance\nClimate Transition and\nInclusive Growth. We\nhave also created the\nrole of Global Head of\nSustainability and\nInclusive Growth,\nwhich, like our One\nGoldman Sachs\ninitiative, is\nintended to facilitate\nthe application of our\nfull capabilities\nacross both Climate\nTransition and\nInclusive Growth. Our\nsustainable finance-\nrelated efforts\ncontinue to evolve.\nFor example, we\nrecently launched the\nSustainable Banking\nGroup, a group focused\non supporting our\ncorporate clients in\nreducing their direct\nand indirect carbon\nemissions.\n\nOur activities\nrelating to\nsustainability present\nboth financial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nand we have processes\nfor managing these\nrisks, similar to the\nother risks we face.\nWe have integrated\noversight of climate-\nrelated risks into our\nrisk management\ngovernance structure,\nfrom senior management\nto our Board and its\ncommittees, including\nthe Risk and Public\nResponsibilities\ncommittees. The Risk\nCommittee of the Board\noversees firmwide\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nwhich include climate\nrisk, and, as part of\nits oversight,\nreceives updates on\nour risk management\napproach to climate\nrisk. The Public\nResponsibilities\nCommittee of the Board\nassists the Board in\nits oversight of our\nfirmwide\nsustainability\nstrategy and\nsustainability risks\naffecting us,\nincluding with respect\nto climate change. As\npart of its oversight,\nthe Public\nResponsibilities\nCommittee receives\nperiodic updates on\nour sustainability\nstrategy, and also\nperiodically reviews\nour governance and\nrelated policies and\nprocesses for\nsustainability and\nclimate change-related\nrisks. We have also\nimplemented an\nEnvironmental Policy\nFramework to guide our\noverall approach to\nsustainability issues.\nWe apply this\nFramework when\nevaluating\ntransactions for\nenvironmental and\nsocial risks and\nimpacts. Our employees\nalso receive training\nwith respect to\nenvironmental and\nsocial risks,\nincluding for sectors\nand industries that we\nbelieve have higher\npotential for these\nrisks.

In\nFebruary 2021, we\nissued our inaugural\nsustainability bond of\n$800 million, and in\nJune 2022 we issued\nour second benchmark\nsustainability bond of\n$700 million. These\nissuances align with\nour sustainable\nfinance framework for\nfuture issuances and\nfund a range of on-\nbalance sheet\nsustainable finance\nactivity. We believe\nwe can advance\nsustainability by\npartnering with our\nclients across our\nbusinesses, including\nby developing new\nsustainability-linked\nfinancing solutions,\noffering strategic\nadvice, or coinvesting\nalongside our clients\nin clean energy\ncompanies. We have\nannounced a target to\ndeploy $750 billion in\nsustainable financing,\ninvesting and advisory\nactivity by the\nbeginning of 2030. As\nof December 2022, we\nachieved approximately\n55% of that goal, with\nthe majority dedicated\nto Climate Transition.\n\nWith respect to\nClimate Transition, we\nhave announced our\ncommitment to align\nour financing\nactivities with a net-\nzero-by-2050 pathway.\nIn that context, we\nhave set an initial\nset of targets for\n2030 focused on three\nsectors \u2014 power, oil\nand gas, and auto\nmanufacturing \u2014 where\nwe see an opportunity\nto proactively engage\nour clients and\ninvestors, deploy\ncapital required for\ntransition, and invest\nin new commercial\nsolutions to drive\ndecarbonization in the\nreal economy. Carbon\nneutrality is also a\npriority for the\noperation of our firm\nand our supply chain.\nIn 2015, we achieved\ncarbon neutrality in\nour operations and\nbusiness travel, ahead\nof our 2020 goal\nannounced in 2009. We\nhave expanded our\noperational carbon\ncommitment to include\nour supply chain,\ntargeting net-zero\ncarbon emissions by\n2030.\n\nIn addition to Climate\nTransition, our\napproach to\nsustainability also\ncenters on Inclusive\nGrowth where we seek\nto drive solutions\nthat expand access,\nincrease\naffordability, and\ndrive outcomes to\nadvance sustainable\neconomic growth. We\nhave sponsored\ninitiatives, such as\nOne Million Black\nWomen, Launch With GS,\nthe Urban Investment\nGroup, 10,000 Women\nand 10,000 Small\nBusinesses . An\noverarching theme of\nour sustainability\nstrategy is promoting\ndiversity and\ninclusion as an\nimperative for us, as\nwell as for our\nclients and their\nboards. These efforts\nare further\nstrengthened by\nstrategic partnerships\nthat we have\nestablished in areas\nwhere we have\nidentified gaps or\nbelieve we are able to\ndrive even greater\nimpact through\ncollaboration. We\nbelieve our ability to\nachieve our\nsustainability\nobjectives is\ncritically dependent\non the strengths and\ntalents of our people,\nand we recognize that\nour people are able to\nmaximize their impact\nby collaborating in a\ndiverse and inclusive\nwork environment.

AND\nSUBSIDIARIES\n\nCompetition\nThe financial services\nindustry and all of\nour businesses are\nintensely competitive,\nand we expect them to\nremain so. Our\ncompetitors provide\ninvestment banking,\nmarket-making and\nasset management\nservices, private\nbanking and lending,\ncommercial lending,\npoint-of-sale\nfinancing, credit\ncards, transaction\nbanking, deposit-\ntaking and other\nbanking products and\nservices, and make\ninvestments in\nsecurities,\ncommodities,\nderivatives, real\nestate, loans and\nother financial\nassets. Our\ncompetitors include\nbrokers and dealers,\ninvestment banking\nfirms, commercial\nbanks, credit card\nissuers, insurance\ncompanies, investment\nadvisers, mutual\nfunds, hedge funds,\nprivate equity funds,\nmerchant banks,\nconsumer finance\ncompanies and\nfinancial technology\nand other internet-\nbased companies. Some\nof our competitors\noperate globally and\nothers regionally, and\nwe compete based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding transaction\nexecution, client\nexperience, products\nand services,\ninnovation, reputation\nand price.\n\nWe have faced, and\nexpect to continue to\nface, pressure to\nretain market share by\ncommitting capital to\nbusinesses or\ntransactions on terms\nthat offer returns\nthat may not be\ncommensurate with\ntheir risks. In\nparticular, corporate\nclients seek such\ncommitments (such as\nagreements to\nparticipate in their\nloan facilities) from\nfinancial services\nfirms in connection\nwith investment\nbanking and other\nassignments.\n\nConsolidation and\nconvergence have\nsignificantly\nincreased the capital\nbase and geographic\nreach of some of our\ncompetitors and have\nalso hastened the\nglobalization of the\nsecurities and other\nfinancial services\nmarkets. As a result,\nwe have had to commit\ncapital to support our\ninternational\noperations and to\nexecute large global\ntransactions. To\ncapitalize on some of\nour most significant\nopportunities, we will\nhave to compete\nsuccessfully with\nfinancial institutions\nthat are larger and\nhave more capital and\nthat may have a\nstronger local\npresence and longer\noperating history\noutside the U.S.\n\nWe also compete with\nsmaller institutions\nthat offer more\ntargeted services,\nsuch as independent\nadvisory firms. Some\nclients may perceive\nthese firms to be less\nsusceptible to\npotential conflicts of\ninterest than we are,\nand, as described\nbelow, our ability to\neffectively compete\nwith them could be\naffected by\nregulations and\nlimitations on\nactivities that apply\nto us but may not\napply to them.\n\nA number of our\nbusinesses are subject\nto intense price\ncompetition. Efforts\nby our competitors to\ngain market share have\nresulted in pricing\npressure in our\ninvestment banking,\nmarket-making,\nconsumer, wealth\nmanagement and asset\nmanagement businesses.\nFor example, the\nincreasing volume of\ntrades executed\nelectronically,\nthrough the internet\nand through\nalternative trading\nsystems, has increased\nthe pressure on\ntrading commissions,\nin that commissions\nfor electronic trading\nare generally lower\nthan those for non-\nelectronic trading. It\nappears that this\ntrend toward low-\ncommission trading\nwill continue. Price\ncompetition has also\nled to compression in\nthe difference between\nthe price at which a\nmarket participant is\nwilling to sell an\ninstrument and the\nprice at which another\nmarket participant is\nwilling to buy it\n(i.e., bid/offer\nspread), which has\naffected our market-\nmaking businesses. The\nincreasing prevalence\nof passive investment\nstrategies that\ntypically have lower\nfees than other\nstrategies we offer\nhas affected the\ncompetitive and\npricing dynamics for\nour asset management\nproducts and services.\nIn addition, we\nbelieve that we will\ncontinue to experience\ncompetitive pressures\nin these and other\nareas in the future as\nsome of our\ncompetitors seek to\nobtain market share by\nfurther reducing\nprices, and as we\nenter into or expand\nour presence in\nmarkets that rely more\nheavily on electronic\ntrading and execution.\nWe and other banks\nalso compete for\ndeposits on the basis\nof the rates we offer.\nIncreases in short-\nterm interest rates\nhave resulted in and\nare expected to\ncontinue to result in\nmore intense\ncompetition in deposit\npricing.\n\nWe also compete on the\nbasis of the types of\nfinancial products and\nclient experiences\nthat we and our\ncompetitors offer. In\nsome circumstances,\nour competitors may\noffer financial\nproducts that we do\nnot offer and that our\nclients may prefer,\nincluding\ncryptocurrencies and\nother digital assets\nthat we cannot or may\nchoose not to provide.\nOur competitors may\nalso develop\ntechnology platforms\nthat provide a better\nclient experience.\n\nThe provisions of the\nU.S. Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and\nConsumer Protection\nAct (Dodd-Frank Act),\nthe requirements\npromulgated by the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\n(Basel Committee) and\nother financial\nregulations could\naffect our competitive\nposition to the extent\nthat limitations on\nactivities, increased\nfees and compliance\ncosts or other\nregulatory\nrequirements do not\napply, or do not apply\nequally, to all of our\ncompetitors or are not\nimplemented uniformly\nacross different\njurisdictions. For\nexample, the\nprovisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act that\nprohibit proprietary\ntrading and restrict\ninvestments in certain\nhedge and private\nequity funds\ndifferentiate between\nU.S.-based and\nnon-U.S.-based banking\norganizations and give\nnon-U.S.-based banking\norganizations greater\nflexibility to trade\noutside of the U.S.\nand to form and invest\nin funds outside the\nU.S.\n                                     \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    9  \n                                     \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLikewise, the\nobligations with\nrespect to derivative\ntransactions under\nTitle VII of the Dodd-\nFrank Act depend, in\npart, on the location\nof the counterparties\nto the transaction.\nThe impact of\nregulatory\ndevelopments on our\ncompetitive position\nhas depended and will\ncontinue to depend to\na large extent on the\nmanner in which the\nrequired rulemaking\nand regulatory\nguidance evolve, the\nextent of\ninternational\nconvergence, and the\ndevelopment of market\npractice and\nstructures under the\nevolving regulatory\nregimes, as described\nfurther in\n\u201cRegulation\u201d below.\n\nWe also face intense\ncompetition in\nattracting and\nretaining qualified\nemployees. Our ability\nto continue to compete\neffectively has\ndepended and will\ncontinue to depend\nupon our ability to\nattract new employees,\nretain and motivate\nour existing employees\nand to continue to\ncompensate employees\ncompetitively amid\nintense public and\nregulatory scrutiny on\nthe compensation\npractices of large\nfinancial\ninstitutions.

Both the\nAdvanced Capital Rules\nand the Standardized\nCapital Rules include\nminimum risk-based\ncapital requirements\nand additional capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements that must\nbe satisfied solely\nwith Common Equity\nTier 1 (CET1) capital.\nFailure to satisfy a\nbuffer requirement in\nfull would result in\nconstraints on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary\nexecutive\ncompensation. The\nseverity of the\nconstraints would\ndepend on the amount\nof the shortfall and\nthe organization\u2019s\n\u201celigible retained\nincome,\u201d defined as\nthe greater of (i) net\nincome for the four\npreceding quarters,\nnet of distributions\nand associated tax\neffects not reflected\nin net income; and\n(ii) the average of\nnet income over the\npreceding four\nquarters. For Group\nInc., the capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements consist\nof a 2.5% buffer\n(under the Advanced\nCapital Rules), a\nstress capital buffer\n(SCB) (under the\nStandardized Capital\nRules), and both a\ncountercyclical buffer\nand the G-SIB\nsurcharge (under both\nCapital Rules). For GS\nBank USA, the capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements consist\nof a 2.5% buffer and\nthe countercyclical\ncapital buffer.\n\nThe SCB is based on\nthe results of the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s\nsupervisory stress\ntests and our planned\ncommon stock dividends\nand is likely to\nchange over time based\non the results of the\nannual supervisory\nstress tests. See\n\u201cStress Tests and\nCapital Planning\u201d\nbelow. The\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer is\ndesigned to counteract\nsystemic\nvulnerabilities and\ncurrently applies only\nto banking\norganizations subject\nto Category I, II or\nIII standards,\nincluding us and GS\nBank USA. Several\nother national\nsupervisors also\nrequire\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffers. The\nG-SIB surcharge and\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer\napplicable to us may\nchange in the future,\nincluding due to\nadditional guidance\nfrom our regulators\nand/or positional\nchanges. As a result,\nthe minimum capital\nratios to which we are\nsubject are likely to\nchange over time.\n\nThe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nhave a rule that\nimplements the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s\nstandardized approach\nfor measuring\ncounterparty credit\nrisk exposures in\nconnection with\nderivative contracts\n(SA-CCR). Under the\nrule, \u201cAdvanced\napproach\u201d banking\norganizations are\nrequired to use SA-CCR\nfor calculating their\nstandardized risk-\nweighted assets (RWAs)\nand, with some\nadjustments, for\npurposes of\ndetermining their\nsupplementary leverage\nratios (SLRs)\ndiscussed below.\n\nThe capital\nrequirements\napplicable to GSBE,\nGSI and GSIB include\nboth minimum\nrequirements and\nbuffers. See\n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof Operations \u2014\nCapital Management and\nRegulatory Capital\u201d in\nPart II, Item 7 of\nthis Form 10\u2011K and\nNote 20 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Form\n10\u2011K for information\nabout our capital\nratios and those of GS\nBank USA, GSBE, GSI\nand GSIB.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nstandards include\nguidelines for\ncalculating\nincremental capital\nratio requirements for\nbanking institutions\nthat are systemically\nsignificant from a\ndomestic but not\nglobal perspective\n(D-SIBs). Depending on\nhow these guidelines\nare implemented by\nnational regulators,\nthey may apply, among\nothers, to certain\nsubsidiaries of\nG-SIBs. These\nguidelines are in\naddition to the\nframework for G-SIBs,\nbut are more\nprinciples-based. The\nU.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nhave not designated\nany D-SIBs. The CRD\nand CRR provide that\ninstitutions that are\nsystemically important\nat the E.U. or member\nstate level, known as\nother systemically\nimportant institutions\n(O-SIIs), may be\nsubject to additional\ncapital ratio\nrequirements,\naccording to their\ndegree of systemic\nimportance (O-SII\nbuffers). BaFin has\nidentified GSBE as an\nO-SII in Germany and\nset an O-SII buffer.\n\nIn the U.K., the PRA\nhas identified Goldman\nSachs Group UK Limited\n(GSG UK), the parent\ncompany of GSI and\nGSIB, as an O-SII but\nhas not applied an\nO-SII buffer.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nhas finalized\nrevisions to the\nframework for\ncalculating capital\nrequirements for\nmarket risk as part of\nits Fundamental Review\nof the Trading Book\n(FRTB). These\nrevisions are expected\nto increase market\nrisk capital\nrequirements for most\nbanking organizations\nand large broker-\ndealers subject to\nbank capital\nrequirements. The\nrevised framework,\namong other things,\nrevises the\nstandardized and\ninternal model-based\napproaches used to\ncalculate market risk\nrequirements and\nclarifies the scope of\npositions subject to\nmarket risk capital\nrequirements. The\nBasel Committee\nframework contemplates\nthat national\nregulators will have\nimplemented the\nrevised framework by\nJanuary 1, 2023. The\nU.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nhave not yet proposed\nrules implementing the\nrevised framework.\nUnder the CRR, E.U.\nfinancial\ninstitutions,\nincluding GSBE,\ncommenced reporting\ntheir market risk\ncalculations under the\nrevised framework in\nthe third quarter of\n2021. In November\n2022, the PRA issued a\nconsultation paper to\nimplement this\nframework.\n                                      \n  12    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Basel Committee\npublished standards\nthat it described as\nthe finalization of\nthe Basel III post-\ncrisis regulatory\nreforms (Basel III\nRevisions). These\nstandards set a floor\non internally modeled\ncapital requirements\nat a percentage of the\ncapital requirements\nunder the standardized\napproach. They also\nrevise the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s\nstandardized and\ninternal model-based\napproaches for credit\nrisk, provide a new\nstandardized approach\nfor operational risk\ncapital and revise the\nframeworks for credit\nvaluation adjustment\n(CVA) risk. The Basel\nCommittee framework\ncontemplates that\nnational regulators\nwill have implemented\nthese standards and\nthat the new floor\nwill be phased in\nthrough January 1,\n2028. The U.S. federal\nbank regulatory\nauthorities have not\nyet proposed rules\nimplementing the Basel\nIII Revisions for\npurposes of their\nrisk-based capital\nratios. The European\nCommission proposed\nrules to implement the\nBasel III Revisions in\nOctober 2021 and in\nNovember 2022, the\nCouncil of the E.U.\nadopted its general\napproach on\nimplementing the Basel\nIII revisions. The\nproposed E.U. rules\ncontemplate amendments\nto the CRR and the\nCRD, referred to as\nCRR III and CRD VI,\ngenerally taking\neffect in January\n2025. In November\n2022, the PRA issued a\nconsultation on the\nimplementation of the\nBasel III Revisions,\nwith a proposed\nJanuary 2025 effective\ndate. Under the PRA\nconsultation, our U.K.\nsubsidiaries are not\nexpected to be subject\nto a floor on\ninternally modeled\ncapital requirements.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nhas published an\nupdated securitization\nframework and a\nrevised G-SIB\nassessment\nmethodology, but the\nU.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nhave not yet proposed\nrules implementing\nthem. The updated\nsecuritization\nframework has been\nimplemented in the\nE.U. and U.K.\n\nIn December 2022, the\nBasel Committee\npublished a final\nstandard on the\nprudential treatment\nof cryptoasset\nexposures. The Basel\nCommittee contemplates\nthat national\nregulators will have\nincorporated the\nstandard into local\ncapital requirements\nby January 1, 2025.\nU.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nand E.U. and U.K.\nauthorities have not\nyet proposed rules\nimplementing the\nstandards.\n\nLeverage Ratios. Under\nthe Capital Framework,\nwe and GS Bank USA are\nsubject to Tier 1\nleverage ratios and\nSLRs established by\nthe FRB. As a G-SIB,\nthe SLR requirements\napplicable to us\ninclude both a minimum\nrequirement and a\nbuffer requirement,\nwhich operates in the\nsame manner as the\nrisk-based buffer\nrequirements described\nabove. In April 2018,\nthe FRB and the OCC\nissued a proposed rule\nwhich would (i)\nreplace the current 2%\nSLR buffer for G-SIBs,\nincluding us, with a\nbuffer equal to 50% of\ntheir G-SIB surcharge\nand (ii) revise the 6%\nSLR requirement for\nCategory I banks, such\nas GS Bank USA, to be\n\u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nwith a requirement\nequal to 3% plus 50%\nof their parent\u2019s\nG-SIB surcharge. This\nproposal, together\nwith the adopted rule\nrequiring use of SA-\nCCR for purposes of\ncalculating the SLR,\nwould implement\ncertain of the\nrevisions to the\nleverage ratio\nframework published by\nthe Basel Committee in\nDecember 2017.\n\nGSBE and certain of\nour U.K. entities are\nalso subject to\nrequirements relating\nto leverage ratios,\nwhich are generally\nbased on the Basel\nCommittee leverage\nratio standards.\n\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof Operations \u2014\nCapital Management and\nRegulatory Capital\u201d in\nPart II, Item 7 of\nthis Form 10-K and\nNote 20 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Form\n10-K for information\nabout our and GS Bank\nUSA\u2019s Tier 1 leverage\nratios and SLRs, and\nGSI\u2019s leverage ratio.\n\nLiquidity Ratios. The\nBasel Committee\u2019s\nframework for\nliquidity risk\nmeasurement, standards\nand monitoring\nrequires banking\norganizations to\nmeasure their\nliquidity against two\nspecific liquidity\ntests: the Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR)\nand the Net Stable\nFunding Ratio (NSFR).\n\nThe LCR rule issued by\nthe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nand applicable to both\nus and GS Bank USA is\ngenerally consistent\nwith the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s framework\nand is designed to\nensure that a banking\norganization maintains\nan adequate level of\nunencumbered, high-\nquality liquid assets\nequal to or greater\nthan the expected net\ncash outflows under an\nacute short-term\nliquidity stress\nscenario. We and GS\nBank USA are required\nto maintain a minimum\nLCR of 100%. See\n\u201cAvailable\nInformation\u201d below and\n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof Operations \u2014 Risk\nManagement \u2014 Liquidity\nRisk Management \u2014\nLiquidity Regulatory\nFramework\u201d in Part II,\nItem 7 of this Form\n10-K for information\nabout our average\ndaily LCR.\n\nGSBE is subject to the\nLCR rule approved by\nthe European\nParliament and\nCouncil, and GSI and\nGSIB are subject to\nthe rules approved by\nthe U.K. regulatory\nauthorities' LCR\nrules. These rules are\ngenerally consistent\nwith the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s framework.\n\nThe NSFR is designed\nto promote medium- and\nlong-term stable\nfunding of the assets\nand off-balance sheet\nactivities of banking\norganizations over a\none-year time horizon.\nThe Basel Committee\u2019s\nNSFR framework\nrequires banking\norganizations to\nmaintain a minimum\nNSFR of 100%.\n\nWe are subject to the\nU.S. NSFR rule and we\nwill be required to\npublicly disclose our\nquarterly average\ndaily NSFR semi-\nannually. We will\nbegin doing so in\nAugust 2023. The CRR\nimplements the NSFR\nfor certain E.U.\nfinancial\ninstitutions,\nincluding GSBE. The\nNSFR requirement\nimplemented in the\nU.K. is applicable to\nboth GSI and GSIB.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    13  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe FRB\u2019s enhanced\nprudential standards\nrequire BHCs with $100\nbillion or more in\ntotal consolidated\nassets to comply with\nenhanced liquidity and\noverall risk\nmanagement standards,\nwhich include\nmaintaining a level of\nhighly liquid assets\nbased on projected\nfunding needs for 30\ndays, and increased\ninvolvement by boards\nof directors in\nliquidity and overall\nrisk management.\nAlthough the liquidity\nrequirement under\nthese rules has some\nsimilarities to the\nLCR, it is a separate\nrequirement. GSBE also\nhas its own liquidity\nplanning process,\nwhich incorporates\ninternally designed\nstress tests and those\nrequired under German\nregulatory\nrequirements and the\nECB Guide to Internal\nLiquidity Adequacy\nAssessment Process\n(ILAAP). GSI and GSIB\nhave their own\nliquidity planning\nprocesses, which\nincorporate internally\ndesigned stress tests\ndeveloped in\naccordance with the\nguidelines of the\nPRA\u2019s ILAAP.\n\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof Operations \u2014 Risk\nManagement \u2014 Overview\nand Structure of Risk\nManagement\u201d and \u201c\u2014\nLiquidity Risk\nManagement \u2014 Liquidity\nRegulatory Framework\u201d\nin Part II, Item 7 of\nthis Form 10-K for\ninformation about the\nLCR and NSFR, as well\nas our risk management\npractices and\nliquidity.\n\nStress Tests and\nCapital Planning. The\nFRB\u2019s Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR) is\ndesigned to ensure\nthat large BHCs,\nincluding us, have\nsufficient capital to\npermit continued\noperations during\ntimes of economic and\nfinancial stress. As\nrequired by the FRB,\nwe perform an annual\ncapital stress test\nand incorporate the\nresults into an annual\ncapital plan, which we\nsubmit to the FRB for\nreview.

The SCB reflects\nstressed losses\nestimated under the\nsupervisory severely\nadverse scenario of\nthe CCAR stress tests,\nas calculated by the\nFRB, and includes four\nquarters of planned\ncommon stock\ndividends. The SCB,\nwhich is subject to a\n2.5% floor, is\ngenerally effective on\nOctober 1 of each year\nand remains in effect\nuntil October 1 of the\nfollowing year, unless\nit is reset in\nconnection with the\nresubmission of a\ncapital plan.

GSBE also has its\nown capital and stress\ntesting process, which\nincorporates\ninternally designed\nstress tests and those\nrequired under German\nregulatory\nrequirements and the\nECB Guide to Internal\nCapital Adequacy\nAssessment Process\n(ICAAP). In addition,\nGSI and GSIB have\ntheir own capital\nplanning and stress\ntesting processes,\nwhich incorporate\ninternally designed\nstress tests developed\nin accordance with the\nPRA\u2019s ICAAP\nguidelines.\n\nLimitations on the\nPayment of Dividends.\nU.S. federal and state\nlaws impose\nlimitations on the\npayment of dividends\nby U.S. depository\ninstitutions, such as\nGS Bank USA. In\ngeneral, the amount of\ndividends that may be\npaid by GS Bank USA is\nlimited to the lesser\nof the amounts\ncalculated under a\nrecent earnings test\nand an undivided\nprofits test. Under\nthe recent earnings\ntest, a dividend may\nnot be paid if the\ntotal of all dividends\ndeclared by the entity\nin any calendar year\nis in excess of the\ncurrent year\u2019s net\nincome combined with\nthe retained net\nincome of the two\npreceding years,\nunless the entity\nobtains regulatory\napproval. Under the\nundivided profits\ntest, a dividend may\nnot be paid in excess\nof the entity\u2019s\nundivided profits\n(generally,\naccumulated net\nprofits that have not\nbeen paid out as\ndividends or\ntransferred to\nsurplus), unless the\nentity receives\nregulatory and\nstockholder approval.\nAs a result of\ndividend payments from\nGS Bank USA to Group\nInc. in connection\nwith the acquisition\nof GSBE in July 2021,\nGS Bank USA cannot\ncurrently declare any\ndividends without\nregulatory approval.\n                                      \n  14    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe applicable U.S.\nbanking regulators\nhave authority to\nprohibit or limit the\npayment of dividends\nif, in the banking\nregulator\u2019s opinion,\npayment of a dividend\nwould constitute an\nunsafe or unsound\npractice in light of\nthe financial\ncondition of the\nbanking organization.\n\nSource of Strength.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nrequires BHCs to act\nas a source of\nstrength to their U.S.\nbank subsidiaries and\nto commit capital and\nfinancial resources to\nsupport those\nsubsidiaries. This\nsupport may be\nrequired by the FRB at\ntimes when BHCs might\notherwise determine\nnot to provide it.\nCapital loans by a BHC\nto a U.S. subsidiary\nbank are subordinate\nin right of payment to\ndeposits and to\ncertain other\nindebtedness of the\nsubsidiary bank. In\naddition, if a BHC\ncommits to a U.S.\nfederal banking agency\nthat it will maintain\nthe capital of its\nbank subsidiary,\nwhether in response to\nthe FRB\u2019s invoking its\nsource-of-strength\nauthority or in\nresponse to other\nregulatory measures,\nthat commitment will\nbe assumed by the\nbankruptcy trustee for\nthe BHC and the bank\nwill be entitled to\npriority payment in\nrespect of that\ncommitment, ahead of\nother creditors of the\nBHC.\n\nTransactions Between\nAffiliates.\nTransactions between\nGS Bank USA or its\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding GSBE, and\nGroup Inc. or its\nother subsidiaries and\naffiliates are subject\nto restrictions under\nthe Federal Reserve\nAct and regulations\nissued by the FRB.\nThese laws and\nregulations generally\nlimit the types and\namounts of\ntransactions (such as\nloans and other credit\nextensions, including\ncredit exposure\narising from resale\nagreements, securities\nborrowing and\nderivative\ntransactions, from GS\nBank USA or its\nsubsidiaries to Group\nInc. or its other\nsubsidiaries and\naffiliates and\npurchases of assets by\nGS Bank USA or its\nsubsidiaries from\nGroup Inc. or its\nother subsidiaries and\naffiliates) that may\ntake place and\ngenerally require\nthose transactions, to\nthe extent permitted,\nto be on market terms\nor better to GS Bank\nUSA or its\nsubsidiaries. These\nlaws and regulations\ngenerally do not apply\nto transactions\nbetween GS Bank USA\nand its subsidiaries.\nSimilarly, German\nregulatory\nrequirements provide\nthat certain\ntransactions between\nGSBE and GS Bank USA\nor its other\naffiliates, including\nGroup Inc., must be on\nmarket terms and are\nsubject to special\ninternal approval\nrequirements. PRA\nrules provide similar\nrequirements for\ntransactions between\nGSI and GSIB and their\nrespective affiliates.\n\nResolution and\nRecovery Plans. We are\nrequired by the FRB\nand the FDIC to submit\na periodic plan for\nour rapid and orderly\nresolution in the\nevent of material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure (resolution\nplan). If these\nregulators jointly\ndetermine that an\ninstitution has failed\nto remediate\nidentified\nshortcomings in its\nresolution plan or\nthat its resolution\nplan, after any\npermitted\nresubmission, is not\ncredible or would not\nfacilitate an orderly\nresolution under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nthey may jointly\nimpose more stringent\ncapital, leverage or\nliquidity requirements\nor restrictions on\ngrowth, activities or\noperations, or may\njointly order the\ninstitution to divest\nassets or operations,\nin order to facilitate\norderly resolution in\nthe event of failure.\nThe FRB and FDIC\nrequire U.S. G-SIBs to\nsubmit resolution\nplans every two years\n(alternating between\nsubmissions of full\nplans and targeted\nplans that include\nonly select\ninformation). We\nsubmitted our 2021\nresolution plan, which\nwas a targeted\nsubmission, in June\n2021, and the FRB and\nFDIC did not identify\nany deficiencies or\nshortcomings.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nhave adopted rules\nimposing restrictions\non qualified financial\ncontracts (QFCs)\nentered into by\nG-SIBs. The rules are\nintended to facilitate\nthe orderly resolution\nof a failed G-SIB by\nlimiting the ability\nof the G-SIB to enter\ninto a QFC unless (i)\nthe counterparty\nwaives certain default\nrights in such\ncontract arising upon\nthe entry of the G\u2011SIB\nor one of its\naffiliates into\nresolution, (ii) the\ncontract does not\ncontain enumerated\nprohibitions on the\ntransfer of such\ncontract and/or any\nrelated credit\nenhancement, and (iii)\nthe counterparty\nagrees that the\ncontract will be\nsubject to the special\nresolution regimes set\nforth in the Dodd-\nFrank Act orderly\nliquidation authority\n(OLA) and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Act\nof 1950 (FDIA),\ndescribed below.

Bank Recovery\nand Resolution\nDirective (BRRD), as\namended by the BRRD\nII, establishes a\nframework for the\nrecovery and\nresolution of\nfinancial institutions\nin the E.U., such as\nGSBE. The BRRD\nprovides national\nsupervisory\nauthorities with tools\nand powers to pre-\nemptively address\npotential financial\ncrises in order to\npromote financial\nstability and minimize\ntaxpayers\u2019 exposure to\nlosses. The BRRD\nrequires E.U. member\nstates to grant\ncertain resolution\npowers to national\nand, where relevant,\nE.U. resolution\nauthorities, including\nthe power to impose a\ntemporary stay and to\nrecapitalize a failing\nentity by writing down\nits unsecured debt or\nconverting its\nunsecured debt into\nequity. Financial\ninstitutions in the\nE.U. must provide that\ncontracts governed by\nnon-E.U. law recognize\nthose temporary stay\nand bail-in powers\nunless doing so would\nbe impracticable. GSBE\nis under the direct\nauthority of the\nSingle Resolution\nBoard for resolution\nplanning. Regulatory\nauthorities in the\nE.U. may require\nfinancial institutions\nin the E.U., including\nsubsidiaries of\nnon-E.U. groups, to\nsubmit recovery plans\nand to assist the\nrelevant resolution\nauthority in\nconstructing\nresolution plans for\nthe E.U. entities.\nGSBE\u2019s primary\nregulator with respect\nto recovery planning\nis the ECB, and it is\nalso regulated by\nBaFin and Deutsche\nBundesbank.\n\nThe U.K. Special\nResolution Regime\nconfers substantially\nthe same powers on the\nBank of England, as\nthe U.K. resolution\nauthority, and\nsubstantially the same\nrequirements on U.K.\nfinancial\ninstitutions. Further,\ncertain U.K. financial\ninstitutions,\nincluding GSI and\nGSIB, are required to\nmeet the Bank of\nEngland\u2019s expectations\ncontained in the U.K.\nResolution Assessment\nFramework, including\nwith respect to loss\nabsorbency,\ncontractual stays,\noperational continuity\nand funding in\nresolution. They are\nalso required by the\nPRA to submit solvent\nwind-down plans on how\nthey could be wound\ndown in a stressed\nenvironment. The PRA\nis also the regulatory\nauthority in the U.K.\nthat supervises\nrecovery planning, and\nGSI and GSIB are each\nrequired to submit\nrecovery plans to the\nPRA.\n\nTotal Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity (TLAC). The\nFRB's rule addresses\nU.S. implementation of\nthe Financial\nStability Board\u2019s\n(FSB\u2019s) TLAC\nprinciples and term\nsheet on minimum TLAC\nrequirements for\nG-SIBs. The rule,\namong other things,\nestablishes minimum\nTLAC requirements,\nestablishes minimum\nrequirements for\n\u201celigible long-term\ndebt\u201d (i.e., debt that\nis unsecured, has a\nmaturity of at least\none year from issuance\nand satisfies certain\nadditional criteria)\nand caps the amount of\nparent company\nliabilities that are\nnot eligible long-term\ndebt.\n\nThe rule also\nprohibits a BHC that\nhas been designated as\na U.S. G-SIB from (i)\nguaranteeing\nsubsidiaries\u2019\nliabilities that are\nsubject to early\ntermination provisions\nif the BHC enters into\nan insolvency or\nreceivership\nproceeding, subject to\nan exception for\nguarantees permitted\nby rules of the U.S.\nfederal banking\nagencies imposing\nrestrictions on QFCs;\n(ii) incurring\nliabilities guaranteed\nby subsidiaries; (iii)\nissuing short-term\ndebt to third parties;\nor (iv) entering into\nderivatives and\ncertain other\nfinancial contracts\nwith external\ncounterparties.\n\nAdditionally, the rule\ncaps, at 5% of the\nvalue of the parent\ncompany\u2019s eligible\nTLAC, the amount of\nunsecured non-\ncontingent third-party\nliabilities that are\nnot eligible long-term\ndebt that could rank\nequally with or junior\nto eligible long-term\ndebt.\n\nThe CRR, the BRRD and\nU.K. financial\nservices regime are\ndesigned to, among\nother things,\nimplement the FSB\u2019s\nminimum TLAC\nrequirement for\nG-SIBs. For example,\nthe CRR requires E.U.\nsubsidiaries of a\nnon-E.U. G-SIB that\nexceed the threshold\nof 5% of the G-SIB\u2019s\nRWAs, operating income\nor leverage exposure,\nsuch as GSBE, to meet\ninternal TLAC\nrequirements. Under\nthe U.K. financial\nservices regime, GSG\nUK exceeds the\napplicable thresholds\nand therefore, it is\nsubject to internal\nTLAC requirements.\n                                      \n  16    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe CRD requires a\nnon-E.U. group with\nmore than \u20ac40 billion\nof assets in the E.U.,\nsuch as us, to\nestablish an E.U.\nintermediate holding\ncompany (E.U. IHC) by\nDecember 30, 2023 if\nit has, as in our\ncase, two or more of\ncertain types of E.U.\nfinancial institution\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding broker-\ndealers and banks.

IHC\nrequirement unless an\nexemption is granted.\nThe CRR requires E.U.\nIHCs to satisfy\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements, a\nminimum requirement\nfor own funds and\neligible liabilities\n(MREL), and certain\nother prudential\nrequirements at a\nconsolidated level.\nThe U.K. has not\nimplemented a similar\nrequirement to\nestablish an IHC;\nhowever, the PRA has\nintroduced a\nrequirement that\ncertain U.K. financial\nholding companies or a\ndesignated U.K. group\nentity be responsible\nfor the U.K. group\u2019s\nregulatory compliance.\nWe have designated GSI\nfor that\nresponsibility.\n\nThe BRRD II and the\nU.K. resolution regime\nsubject institutions\nto an MREL, which is\ngenerally consistent\nwith the FSB\u2019s TLAC\nstandard. GSI is\nrequired to maintain a\nminimum level of\ninternal MREL and\nprovide the Bank of\nEngland the right to\nexercise bail-in\ntriggers over certain\nintercompany\nregulatory capital and\nsenior debt\ninstruments issued by\nGSI. These triggers\nenable the Bank of\nEngland to write down\nsuch instruments or\nconvert such\ninstruments to equity.\nThe triggers can be\nexercised by the Bank\nof England if it\ndetermines that GSI\nhas reached the point\nof non-viability and\nthe FRB and the FDIC\nhave not objected to\nthe bail-in or if\nGroup Inc. enters\nbankruptcy or similar\nproceedings. The\nSingle Resolution\nBoard\u2019s internal MREL\nrequirements\napplicable to GSBE are\nrequired to be phased\nin through January\n2024.\n\nInsolvency of a BHC or\nIDI. The Dodd-Frank\nAct created a\nresolution regime,\nOLA, for BHCs and\ntheir affiliates that\nare systemically\nimportant. Under OLA,\nthe FDIC may be\nappointed as receiver\nfor the systemically\nimportant institution\nand its failed non-\nbank subsidiaries if,\nupon the\nrecommendation of\napplicable regulators,\nthe U.S. Secretary of\nthe Treasury\ndetermines, among\nother things, that the\ninstitution is in\ndefault or in danger\nof default, that the\ninstitution\u2019s failure\nwould have serious\nadverse effects on the\nU.S. financial system\nand that resolution\nunder OLA would avoid\nor mitigate those\neffects.\n\nIf the FDIC is\nappointed as receiver\nunder OLA, then the\npowers of the\nreceiver, and the\nrights and obligations\nof creditors and other\nparties who have dealt\nwith the institution,\nwould be determined\nunder OLA, and not\nunder the bankruptcy\nor insolvency law that\nwould otherwise apply.\nThe powers of the\nreceiver under OLA are\ngenerally based on the\npowers of the FDIC as\nreceiver for\ndepository\ninstitutions under the\nFDIA, described below.\n\nSubstantial\ndifferences in the\nrights of creditors\nexist between OLA and\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, including the\nright of the FDIC\nunder OLA to disregard\nthe strict priority of\ncreditor claims in\nsome circumstances,\nthe use of an\nadministrative claims\nprocedure to determine\ncreditors\u2019 claims (as\nopposed to the\njudicial procedure\nutilized in bankruptcy\nproceedings), and the\nright of the FDIC to\ntransfer claims to a\n\u201cbridge\u201d entity. In\naddition, OLA limits\nthe ability of\ncreditors to enforce\ncertain contractual\ncross-defaults against\naffiliates of the\ninstitution in\nreceivership. The FDIC\nhas issued a notice\nthat it would likely\nresolve a failed FHC\nby transferring its\nassets to a \u201cbridge\u201d\nholding company under\nits \u201csingle point of\nentry\u201d or \u201cSPOE\u201d\nstrategy pursuant to\nOLA.\n\nUnder the FDIA, if the\nFDIC is appointed as\nconservator or\nreceiver for an IDI\nsuch as GS Bank USA,\nupon its insolvency or\nin certain other\nevents, the FDIC has\nbroad powers,\nincluding the power:\n\n\u2022 To transfer any of\nthe IDI\u2019s assets and\nliabilities to a new\nobligor, including a\nnewly formed \u201cbridge\u201d\nbank, without the\napproval of the\ndepository\ninstitution\u2019s\ncreditors;\n\n\u2022 To enforce the IDI\u2019s\ncontracts pursuant to\ntheir terms without\nregard to any\nprovisions triggered\nby the appointment of\nthe FDIC in that\ncapacity; or\n\n\u2022 To repudiate or\ndisaffirm any contract\nor lease to which the\nIDI is a party, the\nperformance of which\nis determined by the\nFDIC to be burdensome\nand the repudiation or\ndisaffirmance of which\nis determined by the\nFDIC to promote the\norderly administration\nof the IDI.\n\nIn addition, the\nclaims of holders of\ndomestic deposit\nliabilities and\ncertain claims for\nadministrative\nexpenses against an\nIDI would be afforded\na priority over other\ngeneral unsecured\nclaims, including\ndeposits at non-U.S.\nbranches and claims of\ndebtholders of the\nIDI, in the\n\u201cliquidation or other\nresolution\u201d of such an\ninstitution by any\nreceiver. As a result,\nwhether or not the\nFDIC ever sought to\nrepudiate any debt\nobligations of GS Bank\nUSA, the debtholders\n(other than depositors\nat U.S. branches)\nwould be treated\ndifferently from, and\ncould receive, if\nanything,\nsubstantially less\nthan, the depositors\nat U.S. branches of GS\nBank USA .\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    17  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The FDIC\u2019s\nDeposit Insurance Fund\nis funded by\nassessments on IDIs.\nGS Bank USA\u2019s\nassessment (subject to\nadjustment by the\nFDIC) is currently\nbased on its average\ntotal consolidated\nassets less its\naverage tangible\nequity during the\nassessment period, its\nsupervisory ratings\nand specified forward-\nlooking financial\nmeasures used to\ncalculate the\nassessment rate. The\ndeposits of GSBE are\ncovered by the German\nstatutory deposit\nprotection program to\nthe extent provided by\nlaw. In addition, GSBE\nhas elected to\nparticipate in the\nGerman voluntary\ndeposit protection\nprogram which provides\ninsurance for certain\neligible deposits not\ncovered by the German\nstatutory deposit\nprogram. Eligible\ndeposits at GSIB and\nthe London branch of\nGS Bank USA are\ncovered by the U.K.\nFinancial Services\nCompensation Scheme up\nto the applicable\nlimits.\n\nIn October 2022, the\nFDIC adopted a rule\napplicable to all\nFDIC-insured banks\nthat increased initial\nbase deposit insurance\nassessment rates by 2\nbasis points,\nbeginning with the\nfirst quarterly\nassessment period of\n2023.\n\nPrompt Corrective\nAction. The U.S.\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nImprovement Act of\n1991 (FDICIA) requires\nthe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies to\ntake \u201cprompt\ncorrective action\u201d in\nrespect of depository\ninstitutions that do\nnot meet specified\ncapital requirements.\nFDICIA establishes\nfive capital\ncategories for FDIC-\ninsured banks, such as\nGS Bank USA: well-\ncapitalized,\nadequately\ncapitalized,\nundercapitalized,\nsignificantly\nundercapitalized and\ncritically\nundercapitalized.\n\nAn institution may be\ndowngraded to, or\ndeemed to be in, a\ncapital category that\nis lower than is\nindicated by its\ncapital ratios if it\nis determined to be in\nan unsafe or unsound\ncondition or if it\nreceives an\nunsatisfactory\nexamination rating\nwith respect to\ncertain matters.\nFDICIA imposes\nprogressively more\nrestrictive\nconstraints on\noperations, management\nand capital\ndistributions, as the\ncapital category of an\ninstitution declines.\nFailure to meet the\ncapital requirements\ncould also require a\ndepository institution\nto raise capital.\nUltimately, critically\nundercapitalized\ninstitutions are\nsubject to the\nappointment of a\nreceiver or\nconservator, as\ndescribed in\n\u201cInsolvency of an IDI\nor a BHC\u201d above.\n\nThe prompt corrective\naction regulations do\nnot apply to BHCs.\nHowever, the FRB is\nauthorized to take\nappropriate action at\nthe BHC level, based\nupon the\nundercapitalized\nstatus of the BHC\u2019s\ndepository institution\nsubsidiaries. In\ncertain instances,\nrelating to an\nundercapitalized\ndepository institution\nsubsidiary, the BHC\nwould be required to\nguarantee the\nperformance of the\nundercapitalized\nsubsidiary\u2019s capital\nrestoration plan and\nmight be liable for\ncivil money damages\nfor failure to fulfill\nits commitments on\nthat guarantee.\nFurthermore, in the\nevent of the\nbankruptcy of the BHC,\nthe guarantee would\ntake priority over the\nBHC\u2019s general\nunsecured creditors,\nas described in\n\u201cSource of Strength\u201d\nabove.\n\nVolcker Rule and Other\nRestrictions on\nActivities. As a BHC,\nwe are subject to\nlimitations on the\ntypes of business\nactivities in which we\nmay engage.\n\nVolcker Rule. The\nVolcker Rule prohibits\n\u201cproprietary trading,\u201d\nbut permits activities\nsuch as underwriting,\nmarket making and\nrisk-mitigation\nhedging, requires an\nextensive compliance\nprogram and includes\nadditional reporting\nand record-keeping\nrequirements.\n\nIn addition, the\nVolcker Rule limits\nthe sponsorship of,\nand investment in,\n\u201ccovered funds\u201d (as\ndefined in the rule)\nby banking entities,\nincluding us. It also\nlimits certain types\nof transactions\nbetween us and our\nsponsored and advised\nfunds, similar to the\nlimitations on\ntransactions between\ndepository\ninstitutions and their\naffiliates. Covered\nfunds include our\nprivate equity funds,\ncertain of our credit\nand real estate funds,\nour hedge funds and\ncertain other\ninvestment structures.\nThe limitation on\ninvestments in covered\nfunds requires us to\nlimit our investment\nin each such fund to\n3% or less of the\nfund\u2019s net asset\nvalue, and to limit\nour aggregate\ninvestment in all such\nfunds to 3% or less of\nour Tier 1 capital.\n\nThe FRB has granted\nour request for\nadditional time until\nJuly 2023 to conform\nour investments in,\nand relationships\nwith, certain legacy\n\u201cilliquid funds\u201d (as\ndefined in the Volcker\nRule) that were in\nplace prior to\nDecember 2013.

In\naddition, certain\nFHCs, including us,\nare permitted to\nengage in certain\ncommodities activities\nin the U.S. that may\notherwise be\nimpermissible for\nBHCs, so long as the\nassets held pursuant\nto these activities do\nnot equal 5% or more\nof their consolidated\nassets.\n\nThe FRB, however, has\nthe authority to limit\nan FHC\u2019s ability to\nconduct activities\nthat would otherwise\nbe permissible, and\nwill likely do so if\nthe FHC does not\nsatisfactorily meet\ncertain requirements\nof the FRB. For\nexample, if an FHC or\nany of its U.S.\ndepository institution\nsubsidiaries ceases to\nmaintain its status as\nwell-capitalized or\nwell-managed, the FRB\nmay impose corrective\ncapital and/or\nmanagerial\nrequirements, as well\nas additional\nlimitations or\nconditions.

The\nbest execution\nstandard applies to\nall securities and\nsupplements, but does\nnot replace, the\nexisting FINRA and\nMunicipal Securities\nRulemaking Board\n(MSRB) best execution\nrules. The SEC also\nproposed, among other\nthings, to require\nthat individual\ninvestor orders routed\nthrough broker-dealers\nbe exposed to order-\nby-order competition\nin qualified auctions;\nto update the minimum\npricing increments,\nwith variable price\nincrements based on\nthe trading\ncharacteristics of\nstocks; and to revise\nand expand reporting\nand disclosure\nrequirements relating\nto execution quality.\n\nIn January 2023, the\nSEC proposed a rule\nthat would prohibit\nparticipants involved\nin the creation of\nasset-backed\nsecurities, including\nany underwriter,\nplacement agent,\ninitial purchaser or\nsponsor of an asset-\nbacked security (or\nany affiliate or\nsubsidiary), from\nengaging in any\ntransaction that would\ninvolve or result in a\nmaterial conflict of\ninterest between the\nsecuritization\nparticipant and an\ninvestor in an asset-\nbacked security,\nincluding reducing its\nexposure to the asset-\nbacked securities,\nsubject to certain\nexceptions.\n\nThe SEC, FINRA and\nregulators in various\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions\nhave imposed both\nconduct-based and\ndisclosure-based\nrequirements with\nrespect to research\nreports and research\nanalysts and may\nimpose additional\nregulations.\n\nGS&Co. and other U.S.\nsubsidiaries are also\nsubject to rules\nadopted by U.S.\nfederal agencies\npursuant to the Dodd-\nFrank Act that require\nany person who\norganizes or initiates\ncertain asset-backed\nsecurities\ntransactions to retain\na portion (generally,\nat least five percent)\nof any credit risk\nthat the person\nconveys to a third\nparty.

The\nguidance sets forth\nthe following three\nkey principles with\nrespect to incentive\ncompensation\narrangements: (i) the\narrangements should\nprovide employees with\nincentives that\nappropriately balance\nrisk and financial\nresults in a manner\nthat does not\nencourage employees to\nexpose their\norganizations to\nimprudent risk; (ii)\nthe arrangements\nshould be compatible\nwith effective\ncontrols and risk\nmanagement; and (iii)\nthe arrangements\nshould be supported by\nstrong corporate\ngovernance. The\nguidance provides that\nsupervisory findings\nwith respect to\nincentive compensation\nwill be incorporated,\nas appropriate, into\nthe organization\u2019s\nsupervisory ratings,\nwhich can affect its\nability to make\nacquisitions or\nperform other actions.\nThe guidance also\nnotes that enforcement\nactions may be taken\nagainst a banking\norganization if its\nincentive compensation\narrangements or\nrelated risk\nmanagement, control or\ngovernance processes\npose a risk to the\norganization\u2019s safety\nand soundness.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nrequires U.S.\nfinancial regulators,\nincluding the FRB and\nSEC, to adopt rules on\nincentive-based\npayment arrangements\nat specified regulated\nentities having at\nleast $1 billion in\ntotal assets. The U.S.\nfinancial regulators\nproposed revised rules\nin 2016, which have\nnot been finalized. In\nOctober 2022, the SEC\nadopted a final rule\nrequiring securities\nexchanges to adopt\nrules mandating, in\nthe case of a\nrestatement, the\nrecovery or \u201cclawback\u201d\nof excess incentive-\nbased compensation\npaid to current or\nformer executive\nofficers and requiring\nlisted issuers to\ndisclose any recovery\nanalysis where\nrecovery is triggered\nby a restatement.\n\nThe NYDFS\u2019 guidance\nemphasizes that any\nincentive compensation\narrangements tied to\nemployee performance\nindicators at banking\ninstitutions regulated\nby the NYDFS,\nincluding GS Bank USA,\nmust be subject to\neffective risk\nmanagement, oversight\nand control.\n\nIn the E.U., certain\nprovisions in the CRR\nand CRD are designed\nto meet the FSB\u2019s\ncompensation\nstandards.

Through\nthese and other\nprovisions, the BSA\nseeks, among other\nthings, to promote the\nidentification of\nparties that may be\ninvolved in terrorism,\nmoney laundering or\nother suspicious\nactivities.\n\nThe Anti-Money\nLaundering Act of 2020\n(AMLA), which amends\nthe BSA, is intended\nto comprehensively\nreform and modernize\nU.S. anti-money\nlaundering laws. Among\nother things, the AMLA\ncodifies a risk-based\napproach to anti-money\nlaundering compliance\nfor financial\ninstitutions; requires\nthe U.S. Department of\nthe Treasury to\npromulgate priorities\nfor anti-money\nlaundering and\ncountering the\nfinancing of terrorism\npolicy; requires the\ndevelopment of\nstandards by the U.S.\nDepartment of the\nTreasury for testing\ntechnology and\ninternal processes for\nBSA compliance;\nexpands enforcement-\nand investigation-\nrelated authority,\nincluding a\nsignificant expansion\nin the available\nsanctions for certain\nBSA violations; and\nexpands BSA\nwhistleblower\nincentives and\nprotections. Many of\nthe statutory\nprovisions in the AMLA\nwill require\nadditional\nrulemakings, reports\nand other measures,\nand the impact of the\nAMLA will depend on,\namong other things,\nrulemaking and\nimplementation\nguidance. The\nFinancial Crimes\nEnforcement Network\n(FinCEN), a bureau of\nthe U.S. Department of\nTreasury has issued\nthe priorities for\nanti-money laundering\nand countering the\nfinancing of terrorism\npolicy, as required\nunder the AMLA.

Any such\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect our\nor our clients\u2019\nbusinesses.\n\nFinancial institution\nreturns may be\nnegatively impacted by\nincreased funding\ncosts due in part to\nthe lack of perceived\ngovernment support of\nsuch institutions in\nthe event of future\nfinancial crises\nrelative to financial\ninstitutions in\ncountries in which\ngovernmental support\nis maintained. In\naddition, liquidity in\nthe financial markets\nhas in the past been,\nand could in the\nfuture be, negatively\nimpacted as market\nparticipants and\nmarket practices and\nstructures adjust to\nevolving regulatory\nframeworks.\n\nIn January 2023, the\noutstanding debt of\nthe U.S. reached its\nstatutory limit and\nthe U.S. Treasury\nDepartment commenced\ntaking extraordinary\nmeasures to prevent\nthe U.S. from\ndefaulting on its\nobligations. If\nCongress does not\nraise the debt\nceiling, the U.S.\ncould default on its\nobligations, including\nTreasury securities\nthat play an integral\nrole in financial\nmarkets. A default by\nthe U.S. could result\nin unprecedented\nmarket volatility and\nilliquidity,\nheightened operational\nrisks relating to the\nclearance and\nsettlement of\ntransactions, margin\nand other disputes\nwith clients and\ncounterparties, an\nadverse impact to\ninvestors including\nmoney market funds\nthat invest in U.S.\nTreasuries, downgrades\nin the U.S. credit\nrating, further\nincreases in interest\nrates and borrowing\ncosts and a recession\nin the U.S. or other\neconomies. Even if the\nU.S. does not default,\ncontinued uncertainty\nrelating to the debt\nceiling could result\nin downgrades of the\nU.S. credit rating,\nwhich could adversely\naffect market\nconditions, lead to\nmargin disputes,\nfurther increases in\ninterest rates and\nborrowing costs and\nnecessitate\nsignificant\noperational changes\namong market\nparticipants,\nincluding us. A\ndowngrade of the\nfederal government\u2019s\ncredit rating could\nalso materially and\nadversely affect the\nmarket for repurchase\nagreements, securities\nborrowing and lending,\nand other financings\ntypically\ncollateralized by U.S.\nTreasury or agency\nobligations. Further,\nthe fair value,\nliquidity and credit\nratings of securities\nissued by, or other\nobligations of,\nagencies of the U.S.\ngovernment or related\nto the U.S. government\nor its agencies, as\nwell as municipal\nbonds could be\nsimilarly adversely\naffected.\n\nOur businesses have\nbeen and may in the\nfuture be adversely\naffected by declining\nasset values,\nparticularly where we\nhave net \u201clong\u201d\npositions, receive\nfees based on the\nvalue of assets\nmanaged, or receive or\npost collateral.\n\nMany of our businesses\nhave net \u201clong\u201d\npositions in debt\nsecurities, loans,\nderivatives,\nmortgages, equities\n(including private\nequity and real\nestate) and most other\nasset classes.

We\nmay incur losses from\ntime to time as\ntrading markets\ndeteriorate or cease\nto function, including\nwith respect to loan\ncommitments we have\nmade or securities\nofferings we have\nunderwritten. The\ninability to sell or\neffectively hedge\nassets reduces our\nability to limit\nlosses in such\npositions and the\ndifficulty in valuing\nassets has in the past\nnegatively affected,\nand may in the future\nnegatively affect, our\ncapital, liquidity or\nleverage ratios, our\nfunding costs and our\nability to deploy\ncapital.\n\nIn our exchange-based\nmarket-making\nactivities, we are\nobligated by stock\nexchange rules to\nmaintain an orderly\nmarket, including by\npurchasing securities\nin a declining market.\nIn markets where asset\nvalues are declining\nand in volatile\nmarkets, this results\nin losses and an\nincreased need for\nliquidity.\n\nWe receive asset-based\nmanagement fees based\non the value of our\nclients\u2019 portfolios or\ninvestment in funds\nmanaged by us and, in\nsome cases, we also\nreceive incentive fees\nbased on increases in\nthe value of such\ninvestments. Declines\nin asset values would\nordinarily reduce the\nvalue of our clients\u2019\nportfolios or fund\nassets, which in turn\nwould typically reduce\nthe fees we earn for\nmanaging such assets.\n                                      \n  30    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

An\nexample of such a\nsituation is a \u201cmargin\ncall\u201d in connection\nwith a brokerage\naccount. Therefore,\ndeclines in the value\nof asset classes used\nas collateral mean\nthat either the cost\nof funding positions\nis increased or the\nsize of positions is\ndecreased. If we are\nthe party providing\ncollateral, this can\nincrease our costs and\nreduce our\nprofitability and if\nwe are the party\nreceiving collateral,\nthis can also reduce\nour profitability by\nreducing the level of\nbusiness done with our\nclients and\ncounterparties.\n\nIn addition, volatile\nor less liquid markets\nincrease the\ndifficulty of valuing\nassets, which can lead\nto costly and time-\nconsuming disputes\nover asset values and\nthe level of required\ncollateral, as well as\nincreased credit risk\nto the recipient of\nthe collateral due to\ndelays in receiving\nadequate collateral.\nIn cases where we\nforeclose on\ncollateral, sudden\ndeclines in the value\nor liquidity of the\ncollateral have in the\npast resulted in and\nmay in the future,\ndespite credit\nmonitoring, over-\ncollateralization, the\nability to call for\nadditional collateral\nor the ability to\nforce repayment of the\nunderlying obligation,\nresult in significant\nlosses to us,\nespecially where there\nis a single type of\ncollateral supporting\nthe obligation. In\naddition, we have been\nand may in the future\nbe subject to claims\nthat the foreclosure\nwas not permitted\nunder the legal\ndocuments, was\nconducted in an\nimproper manner,\nincluding in violation\nof law, or caused a\nclient or counterparty\nto go out of business.\n\nOur market-making\nactivities have been\nand may in the future\nbe affected by changes\nin the levels of\nmarket volatility.\n\nCertain of our market-\nmaking activities\ndepend on market\nvolatility to provide\ntrading and arbitrage\nopportunities to our\nclients, and decreases\nin volatility have\nreduced and may in the\nfuture reduce these\nopportunities and the\nlevel of client\nactivity associated\nwith them and\nadversely affect the\nresults of these\nactivities. Increased\nvolatility, while it\ncan increase trading\nvolumes and spreads,\nalso increases risk as\nmeasured by Value-at-\nRisk (VaR) and may\nexpose us to increased\nrisks in connection\nwith our market-making\nactivities or may\ncause us to reduce our\ninventory in order to\navoid increasing our\nVaR. Limiting the size\nof our market-making\npositions can\nadversely affect our\nprofitability. In\nperiods when\nvolatility is\nincreasing, but asset\nvalues are declining\nsignificantly, it may\nnot be possible to\nsell assets at all or\nit may only be\npossible to do so at\nsteep discounts. In\nthose circumstances,\nwe have been and may\nin the future be\nforced to either take\non additional risk or\nto realize losses in\norder to decrease our\nVaR. In addition,\nincreases in\nvolatility increase\nthe level of our RWAs,\nwhich increases our\ncapital requirements.\n\nOur investment\nbanking, client\nintermediation, asset\nmanagement and wealth\nmanagement businesses\nhave been adversely\naffected and may in\nthe future be\nadversely affected by\nmarket uncertainty or\nlack of confidence\namong investors and\nCEOs due to declines\nin economic activity\nand other unfavorable\neconomic, geopolitical\nor market conditions.\n\nOur investment banking\nbusiness has been and\nmay in the future be\nadversely affected by\nmarket conditions.\nPoor economic\nconditions and other\nuncertain geopolitical\nconditions may\nadversely affect and\nhave in the past\nadversely affected\ninvestor and CEO\nconfidence, resulting\nin significant\nindustry-wide declines\nin the size and number\nof underwritings and\nof advisory\ntransactions, which\nwould likely have an\nadverse effect on our\nrevenues and our\nprofit margins. In\nparticular, because a\nsignificant portion of\nour investment banking\nrevenues is derived\nfrom our participation\nin large transactions,\na decline in the\nnumber of large\ntransactions has in\nthe past and would in\nthe future adversely\naffect our investment\nbanking business.\nSimilarly, in recent\nyears, cross-border\ninitial public\nofferings and other\nsecurities offerings\nhave accounted for a\nsignificant proportion\nof new issuance\nactivity.

It\nis of critical\nimportance to us, as\nmost of the failures\nof financial\ninstitutions have\noccurred in large part\ndue to insufficient\nliquidity. Our\nliquidity may be\nimpaired by an\ninability to access\nsecured and/or\nunsecured debt\nmarkets, an inability\nto raise or retain\ndeposits, an inability\nto access funds from\nour subsidiaries or\notherwise allocate\nliquidity optimally,\nan inability to sell\nassets or redeem our\ninvestments, lack of\ntimely settlement of\ntransactions, unusual\ndeposit outflows, or\nother unforeseen\noutflows of cash or\ncollateral, such as in\nMarch 2020, when\ncorporate clients drew\non revolving credit\nfacilities in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic. This\nsituation may arise\ndue to circumstances\nthat we may be unable\nto control, such as a\ngeneral market or\neconomic disruption or\nan operational problem\nthat affects third\nparties or us, or even\nby the perception\namong market\nparticipants that we,\nor other market\nparticipants, are\nexperiencing greater\nliquidity risk.\n\nWe employ structured\nproducts to benefit\nour clients and hedge\nour own risks. The\nfinancial instruments\nthat we hold and the\ncontracts to which we\nare a party are often\ncomplex, and these\ncomplex structured\nproducts often do not\nhave readily available\nmarkets to access in\ntimes of liquidity\nstress. Our investing\nand financing\nactivities may lead to\nsituations where the\nholdings from these\nactivities represent a\nsignificant portion of\nspecific markets,\nwhich could restrict\nliquidity for our\npositions.\n\nFurther, our ability\nto sell assets may be\nimpaired if there is\nnot generally a liquid\nmarket for such\nassets, as well as in\ncircumstances where\nother market\nparticipants are\nseeking to sell\nsimilar otherwise\ngenerally liquid\nassets at the same\ntime, as is likely to\noccur in a liquidity\nor other market crisis\nor in response to\nchanges to rules or\nregulations.

These\nregulations require us\nto hold large amounts\nof highly liquid\nassets and reduce our\nflexibility to source\nand deploy funding. In\naddition, our need to\nmanage our operations\nin light of certain\nregulatory\nrequirements when\napplicable thresholds\nare met has in the\npast limited and may\nin the future limit\nour ability to raise\ndeposits in GSIB or\nother funding, which\ncould adversely affect\nour liquidity or\nability to respond\nefficiently to\nliquidity stress.\n                                      \n  32    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We seek to\nfinance many of our\nassets on a secured\nbasis. Any disruptions\nin the credit markets\nmay make it harder and\nmore expensive to\nobtain funding for our\nbusinesses. If our\navailable funding is\nlimited or we are\nforced to fund our\noperations at a higher\ncost, these conditions\nmay require us to\ncurtail our business\nactivities and\nincrease our cost of\nfunding, both of which\ncould reduce our\nprofitability,\nparticularly in our\nbusinesses that\ninvolve investing,\nlending and market\nmaking.\n\nOur clients engaging\nin mergers,\nacquisitions and other\ntypes of strategic\ntransactions often\nrely on access to the\nsecured and unsecured\ncredit markets to\nfinance their\ntransactions.

Many of\nthese derivative\ninstruments are\nindividually\nnegotiated and non-\nstandardized, which\ncan make exiting,\ntransferring or\nsettling positions\ndifficult. Many credit\nderivatives require\nthat we deliver to the\ncounterparty the\nunderlying security,\nloan or other\nobligation in order to\nreceive payment. In a\nnumber of cases, we do\nnot hold the\nunderlying security,\nloan or other\nobligation and may not\nbe able to obtain the\nunderlying security,\nloan or other\nobligation. This could\ncause us to forfeit\nthe payments due to us\nunder these contracts\nor result in\nsettlement delays with\nthe attendant credit\nand operational risk,\nas well as increased\ncosts to us.\n\nDerivative\ntransactions also\ninvolve the risk that\ndocumentation has not\nbeen properly\nexecuted, that\nexecuted agreements\nmay not be enforceable\nagainst the\ncounterparty, or that\nobligations under such\nagreements may not be\nable to be \u201cnetted\u201d\nagainst other\nobligations with such\ncounterparty. In\naddition,\ncounterparties may\nclaim that such\ntransactions were not\nappropriate or\nauthorized.\n\nAs a signatory to the\nISDA Universal\nProtocol or U.S. ISDA\nProtocol (ISDA\nProtocols) and being\nsubject to the FRB\u2019s\nand FDIC\u2019s rules on\nQFCs and similar rules\nin other\njurisdictions, we may\nnot be able to\nexercise remedies\nagainst counterparties\nand, as this regime\nhas not yet been\ntested, we may suffer\nrisks or losses that\nwe would not have\nexpected to suffer if\nwe could immediately\nclose out transactions\nupon a termination\nevent. The ISDA\nProtocols and these\nrules and regulations\nextend to repurchase\nagreements and other\ninstruments that are\nnot derivative\ncontracts.\n\nDerivative contracts\nand other\ntransactions,\nincluding secondary\nbank loan purchases\nand sales, entered\ninto with third\nparties are not always\nconfirmed by the\ncounterparties or\nsettled on a timely\nbasis. While the\ntransaction remains\nunconfirmed or during\nany delay in\nsettlement, we are\nsubject to heightened\ncredit and operational\nrisk and in the event\nof a default may find\nit more difficult to\nenforce our rights.\n\nIn addition, as new\ncomplex derivative\nproducts are created,\ncovering a wider array\nof underlying credit\nand other instruments,\ndisputes about the\nterms of the\nunderlying contracts\ncould arise, which\ncould impair our\nability to effectively\nmanage our risk\nexposures from these\nproducts and subject\nus to increased costs.\nThe provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act\nrequiring central\nclearing of credit\nderivatives and other\nOTC derivatives, or a\nmarket shift toward\nstandardized\nderivatives, could\nreduce the risk\nassociated with these\ntransactions, but\nunder certain\ncircumstances could\nalso limit our ability\nto develop derivatives\nthat best suit the\nneeds of our clients\nand to hedge our own\nrisks, and could\nadversely affect our\nprofitability. In\naddition, these\nprovisions have\nincreased our credit\nexposure to central\nclearing platforms.\n                                              \n  Operational                                 \n                                              \nA failure in our\noperational systems or\nhuman error,\nmalfeasance or other\nmisconduct, could\nimpair our liquidity,\ndisrupt our\nbusinesses, result in\nthe disclosure of\nconfidential\ninformation, damage\nour reputation and\ncause losses.\n\nOur businesses are\nhighly dependent on\nour ability to process\nand monitor, on a\ndaily basis, a very\nlarge number of\ntransactions, many of\nwhich are highly\ncomplex and occur at\nhigh volumes and\nfrequencies, across\nnumerous and diverse\nmarkets in many\ncurrencies. These\ntransactions, as well\nas the information\ntechnology services we\nprovide to clients,\noften must adhere to\nclient-specific\nguidelines, as well as\nlegal and regulatory\nstandards.\n\nMany rules and\nregulations worldwide\ngovern our obligations\nto execute\ntransactions and\nreport such\ntransactions and other\ninformation to\nregulators, exchanges\nand investors.\nCompliance with these\nlegal and reporting\nrequirements can be\nchallenging, and we\nhave been and may in\nthe future be subject\nto regulatory fines\nand penalties for\nfailing to follow\nthese rules or to\nreport timely,\naccurate and complete\ninformation in\naccordance with these\nrules. As reporting\nrequirements expand,\ncompliance with these\nrules and regulations\nhas become more\nchallenging.\n\nAs our client base,\nincluding through our\nconsumer businesses,\nand our geographical\nreach expand and the\nvolume, speed,\nfrequency and\ncomplexity of\ntransactions,\nespecially electronic\ntransactions (as well\nas the requirements to\nreport such\ntransactions on a\nreal-time basis to\nclients, regulators\nand exchanges)\nincrease, developing\nand maintaining our\noperational systems\nand infrastructure has\nbecome more\nchallenging, and the\nrisk of systems or\nhuman error in\nconnection with such\ntransactions has\nincreased, as have the\npotential consequences\nof such errors due to\nthe speed and volume\nof transactions\ninvolved and the\npotential difficulty\nassociated with\ndiscovering errors\nquickly enough to\nlimit the resulting\nconsequences. These\nrisks are exacerbated\nin times of increased\nvolatility.

For example,\nfundamental security\nflaws in computer\nchips found in many\ntypes of these\ncomputing devices and\nphones have been\nreported in the past\nand may occur in the\nfuture. The use of\npersonal devices by\nour employees or by\nour vendors for work-\nrelated activities\nalso presents risks\nrelated to potential\nviolations of record\nretention and other\nrequirements. Cloud\ntechnologies are also\ncritical to the\noperation of our\nsystems and platforms\nand our reliance on\ncloud technologies is\ngrowing.

In\naddition, to the\nextent permitted by\napplicable law and\nregulation, we invest\nour own capital in\nprivate equity,\ncredit, real estate\nand hedge funds that\nwe manage and\nlimitations on our\nability to withdraw\nsome or all of our\ninvestments in these\nfunds, whether for\nlegal, reputational or\nother reasons, may\nmake it more difficult\nfor us to control the\nrisk exposures\nrelating to these\ninvestments.\n\nPrudent risk\nmanagement, as well as\nregulatory\nrestrictions, may\ncause us to limit our\nexposure to\ncounterparties,\ngeographic areas or\nmarkets, which may\nlimit our business\nopportunities and\nincrease the cost of\nour funding or hedging\nactivities.\n\nAs we have expanded\nand intend to continue\nto expand the product\nand geographic scope\nof our offerings of\ncredit and investment\nproducts to consumers,\nwe are presented with\ndifferent risks and\nmust expand and adapt\nour risk monitoring\nand mitigation\nactivities to account\nfor these business\nactivities.

We\nface the risk of\nsignificant\nintervention by law\nenforcement,\nregulatory and taxing\nauthorities, as well\nas private litigation,\nin all jurisdictions\nin which we conduct\nour businesses. In\nmany cases, our\nactivities have been\nand may continue to be\nsubject to overlapping\nand divergent\nregulation in\ndifferent\njurisdictions. Among\nother things, as a\nresult of law\nenforcement\nauthorities,\nregulators or private\nparties challenging\nour compliance with\nexisting laws and\nregulations, we or our\nemployees have been,\nand could be, fined,\ncriminally charged or\nsanctioned; prohibited\nfrom engaging in some\nof our business\nactivities; subjected\nto limitations or\nconditions on our\nbusiness activities,\nincluding higher\ncapital requirements;\nor subjected to new or\nsubstantially higher\ntaxes or other\ngovernmental charges\nin connection with the\nconduct of our\nbusinesses or with\nrespect to our\nemployees. These\nlimitations or\nconditions may limit\nour business\nactivities and\nnegatively impact our\nprofitability.\n\nIn addition to the\nimpact on the scope\nand profitability of\nour business\nactivities, day-to-day\ncompliance with\nexisting laws and\nregulations has\ninvolved and will\ncontinue to involve\nsignificant amounts of\ntime, including that\nof our senior leaders\nand that of a large\nnumber of dedicated\ncompliance and other\nreporting and\noperational personnel,\nall of which may\nnegatively impact our\nprofitability.\n\nOur revenues and\nprofitability and\nthose of our\ncompetitors have been\nand will continue to\nbe impacted by\nrequirements relating\nto capital, leverage,\nminimum liquidity and\nlong-term funding\nlevels, requirements\nrelated to resolution\nand recovery planning,\nderivatives clearing\nand margin rules and\nlevels of regulatory\noversight, as well as\nlimitations on which\nand, if permitted, how\ncertain business\nactivities may be\ncarried out by\nfinancial\ninstitutions. The laws\nand regulations that\napply to our\nbusinesses are often\ncomplex and, in many\ncases, we must make\ninterpretive decisions\nregarding the\napplication of those\nlaws and regulations\nto our business\nactivities. Changes in\ninterpretations,\nwhether in response to\nregulatory guidance,\nindustry conventions,\nour own reassessments\nor otherwise, could\nadversely affect our\nbusinesses, results of\noperations or ability\nto satisfy applicable\nregulatory\nrequirements, such as\ncapital or liquidity\nrequirements.\n\nIf there are new laws\nor regulations or\nchanges in the\ninterpretation or\nenforcement of\nexisting laws or\nregulations applicable\nto our businesses or\nthose of our clients,\nincluding capital,\nliquidity, leverage,\nlong-term debt, total\nloss-absorbing\ncapacity and margin\nrequirements,\nrestrictions on\nleveraged lending or\nother business\npractices, reporting\nrequirements,\nrequirements relating\nto recovery and\nresolution planning,\ntax burdens and\ncompensation\nrestrictions, that are\nimposed on a limited\nsubset of financial\ninstitutions (whether\nbased on size, method\nof funding,\nactivities, geography\nor other criteria),\ncompliance with these\nnew laws or\nregulations, or\nchanges in the\nenforcement of\nexisting laws or\nregulations, could\nadversely affect our\nability to compete\neffectively with other\ninstitutions that are\nnot affected in the\nsame way. In addition,\nregulation imposed on\nfinancial institutions\nor market participants\ngenerally, such as\ntaxes on stock\ntransfers, share\nrepurchases and other\nfinancial\ntransactions, could\nadversely impact\nlevels of market\nactivity more broadly,\nand thus impact our\nbusinesses.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nU.S. and non-U.S.\nregulatory\ndevelopments, in\nparticular the Dodd-\nFrank Act and Basel\nIII, have\nsignificantly altered\nthe regulatory\nframework within which\nwe operate and have\nadversely affected and\nmay in the future\nadversely affect our\nprofitability. Among\nthe aspects of the\nDodd-Frank Act that\nhave affected or may\nin the future affect\nour businesses are:\nincreased capital,\nliquidity and\nreporting\nrequirements;\nlimitations on\nactivities in which we\nmay engage; increased\nregulation of and\nrestrictions on OTC\nderivatives markets\nand transactions;\nlimitations on\nincentive\ncompensation;\nlimitations on\naffiliate\ntransactions;\nrequirements to\nreorganize or limit\nactivities in\nconnection with\nrecovery and\nresolution planning;\nincreased deposit\ninsurance assessments;\nand increased\nstandards of care for\nbroker-dealers and\ninvestment advisers in\ndealing with clients.\nThe implementation of\nhigher capital\nrequirements, more\nstringent requirements\nrelating to liquidity,\nlong-term debt and\ntotal loss-absorbing\ncapacity and the\nprohibition on\nproprietary trading\nand the sponsorship\nof, or investment in,\ncovered funds by the\nVolcker Rule may\ncontinue to adversely\naffect our\nprofitability and\ncompetitive position,\nparticularly if these\nrequirements do not\napply equally to our\ncompetitors or are not\nimplemented uniformly\nacross jurisdictions.\nWe may also become\nsubject to higher and\nmore stringent capital\nand other regulatory\nrequirements as a\nresult of the\nimplementation of\nBasel Committee\nstandards, including\nthe credit and\noperational risk\ncapital standards\npublished in December\n2017 and the market\nrisk capital standard\npublished in January\n2019.\n\nAs described in\n\u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\n\u2014 Banking Supervision\nand Regulation\u201d in\nPart I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K, the SCB has\nreplaced the capital\nconservation buffer\nunder the Standardized\nCapital Rules and\nresulted in higher\nStandardized capital\nratio requirements.\nFailure to comply with\nthese requirements\ncould limit our\nability to, among\nother things,\nrepurchase shares, pay\ndividends and make\ncertain discretionary\ncompensation payments.\nIn addition, if, as in\n2020, we are required\nto resubmit our\ncapital plan, we\ngenerally may not make\ncapital distributions,\nsuch as share\nrepurchases or\ndividends, without the\nprior approval of the\nFRB. Dividends and\nrepurchases are also\nsubject to oversight\nby the FRB, which can\nresult in limitations.\nLimitations on our\nability to make\ncapital distributions\ncould, among other\nthings, prevent us\nfrom returning capital\nto our shareholders\nand impact our return\non equity.\nAdditionally, as a\nG\u2011SIB, we are subject\nto the G\u2011SIB\nsurcharge. Our G\u2011SIB\nsurcharge is updated\nannually based on\nfinancial data from\nthe prior year.\nExpansion of our\nbusinesses, growth in\nour balance sheet and\nincreased reliance on\nshort-term wholesale\nfunding have resulted\nin increases and in\nthe future may result\nin further increases\nin our G\u2011SIB surcharge\nand a corresponding\nincrease in our\ncapital requirements.\n\nWe are also subject to\nlaws and regulations,\nsuch as the GDPR and\nthe California\nConsumer Privacy Act,\nrelating to the\nprivacy of the\ninformation of\nclients, employees or\nothers, and any\nfailure to comply with\nthese laws and\nregulations could\nexpose us to liability\nand/or reputational\ndamage. As new\nprivacy-related laws\nand regulations are\nimplemented, the time\nand resources needed\nfor us to comply with\nsuch laws and\nregulations, as well\nas our potential\nliability for non-\ncompliance and\nreporting obligations\nin the case of data\nbreaches, may\nsignificantly\nincrease.\n\nFurther, the CRD\nrequires certain\nnon-E.U. groups with\nmore than \u20ac40 billion\nof assets in the E.U.,\nsuch as us, to\nestablish an E.U. IHC\nby December 30, 2023.\nA non-E.U. group may\nhave two E.U. IHCs if\na request for a second\nis approved. If we are\nunable to obtain\napproval to have two\nE.U. IHCs, we would be\nrequired to limit our\nEuropean subsidiary\nactivities to those\nthat are permissible\nfor GSBE.\n\nIn addition, our\nbusinesses are\nincreasingly subject\nto laws and\nregulations relating\nto surveillance,\nencryption and data\non-shoring in the\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate. Compliance\nwith these laws and\nregulations may\nrequire us to change\nour policies,\nprocedures and\ntechnology for\ninformation security,\nwhich could, among\nother things, make us\nmore vulnerable to\ncyber attacks and\nmisappropriation,\ncorruption or loss of\ninformation or\ntechnology.\n\nWe have entered into\nconsumer-oriented\ndeposit-taking,\nlending and credit\ncard businesses, and\nwe may expand the\nproduct and geographic\nscope of our\nofferings. Entering\ninto these businesses\nsubjects us to\nnumerous additional\nregulations in the\njurisdictions in which\nthese businesses\noperate. Not only are\nthese regulations\nextensive, but they\ninvolve types of\nregulations and\nsupervision, as well\nas regulatory\ncompliance risks, that\nhave not historically\napplied to us. The\nlevel of regulatory\nscrutiny and the scope\nof regulations\naffecting financial\ninteractions with\nconsumers is often\nmuch greater than that\nassociated with doing\nbusiness with\ninstitutions and high-\nnet-worth individuals.\nComplying with these\nregulations is time-\nconsuming, costly and\npresents new and\nincreased risks.\n                                      \n  42    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In\naddition, regulators\nand courts continue to\nseek to establish\n\u201cfiduciary\u201d\nobligations to\ncounterparties to\nwhich no such duty had\nbeen assumed to exist.\nTo the extent that\nsuch efforts are\nsuccessful, the cost\nof, and liabilities\nassociated with,\nengaging in brokerage,\nclearing, market-\nmaking, prime\nbrokerage, investing\nand other similar\nactivities could\nincrease\nsignificantly. To the\nextent that we have\nfiduciary obligations\nin connection with\nacting as a financial\nadviser or investment\nadviser or in other\nroles for individual,\ninstitutional,\nsovereign or\ninvestment fund\nclients, any breach,\nor even an alleged\nbreach, of such\nobligations could have\nmaterially negative\nlegal, regulatory and\nreputational\nconsequences.\n\nFor information about\nthe extensive\nregulation to which\nour businesses are\nsubject, see \u201cBusiness\n\u2014 Regulation\u201d in Part\nI, Item 1 of this Form\n10-K.\n\nA failure to\nappropriately identify\nand address potential\nconflicts of interest\ncould adversely affect\nour businesses.\n\nDue to the broad scope\nof our businesses and\nour client base, we\nregularly address\npotential conflicts of\ninterest, including\nsituations where our\nservices to a\nparticular client or\nour own investments or\nother interests\nconflict, or are\nperceived to conflict,\nwith the interests of\nthat client or another\nclient, as well as\nsituations where one\nor more of our\nbusinesses have access\nto material non-public\ninformation that may\nnot be shared with our\nother businesses and\nsituations where we\nmay be a creditor of\nan entity with which\nwe also have an\nadvisory or other\nrelationship.\n\nIn addition, our\nstatus as a BHC\nsubjects us to\nheightened regulation\nand increased\nregulatory scrutiny by\nthe FRB with respect\nto transactions\nbetween GS Bank USA\nand its subsidiaries\nand entities that are\nor could be viewed as\naffiliates of ours\nand, under the Volcker\nRule, transactions\nbetween us and covered\nfunds.\n\nWe have extensive\nprocedures and\ncontrols that are\ndesigned to identify\nand address conflicts\nof interest, including\nthose designed to\nprevent the improper\nsharing of information\namong our businesses.\nHowever, appropriately\nidentifying and\ndealing with conflicts\nof interest is complex\nand difficult, and our\nreputation, which is\none of our most\nimportant assets,\ncould be damaged and\nthe willingness of\nclients to enter into\ntransactions with us\nmay be adversely\naffected if we fail,\nor appear to fail, to\nidentify, disclose and\ndeal appropriately\nwith conflicts of\ninterest. In addition,\npotential or perceived\nconflicts could give\nrise to litigation or\nregulatory enforcement\nactions. Additionally,\nour One Goldman Sachs\ninitiative aims to\nincrease collaboration\namong our businesses,\nwhich may increase the\npotential for actual\nor perceived conflicts\nof interest and\nimproper information\nsharing. The\nrealignment of our\nbusinesses, reflected\nin our new segments\nbeginning with the\nfourth quarter of\n2022, presents similar\nrisks.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    43  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Press\ncoverage and other\npublic statements that\nassert some form of\nwrongdoing (including,\nin some cases, press\ncoverage and public\nstatements that do not\ndirectly involve us)\noften result in some\ntype of investigation\nby regulators,\nlegislators and law\nenforcement officials\nor in lawsuits.\n\nResponding to these\ninvestigations and\nlawsuits, regardless\nof the ultimate\noutcome of the\nproceeding, is time-\nconsuming and\nexpensive and can\ndivert the time and\neffort of our senior\nmanagement from our\nbusiness. Penalties\nand fines sought by\nregulatory authorities\nhave increased\nsubstantially and\ncertain regulators\nhave been more likely\nin recent years to\ncommence enforcement\nactions or to support\nlegislation targeted\nat the financial\nservices industry.\nGovernmental\nauthorities may also\nbe more likely to\npursue criminal or\nother actions,\nincluding seeking\nadmissions of\nwrongdoing or guilty\npleas, in connection\nwith the resolution of\nan inquiry or\ninvestigation to the\nextent a company is\nviewed as having\npreviously engaged in\ncriminal, regulatory\nor other misconduct.\nAdverse publicity,\ngovernmental scrutiny\nand legal and\nenforcement\nproceedings can also\nhave a negative impact\non our reputation and\non the morale and\nperformance of our\nemployees, which could\nadversely affect our\nbusinesses and results\nof operations.\nFurther, we are\nsubject to regulatory\nsettlements, orders\nand feedback that\nrequire significant\nremediation\nactivities, which\nrequire us to commit\nsignificant resources,\nincluding hiring, as\nwell as testing the\noperation and\neffectiveness of new\ncontrols, policies and\nprocedures.\n\nThe financial services\nindustry generally and\nour businesses in\nparticular have been\nsubject to negative\npublicity.

The\nspeed and\npervasiveness with\nwhich information can\nbe disseminated\nthrough these\nchannels, in\nparticular social\nmedia, may magnify\nrisks relating to\nnegative publicity.\n\nSubstantial civil or\ncriminal liability or\nsignificant regulatory\naction against us\ncould have material\nadverse financial\neffects or cause us\nsignificant\nreputational harm,\nwhich in turn could\nseriously harm our\nbusiness prospects.\n\nWe face significant\nlegal risks in our\nbusinesses, and the\nvolume of claims and\namount of damages and\npenalties claimed in\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nagainst financial\ninstitutions remain\nhigh. See Notes 18 and\n27 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements\nin Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Form 10-K for\ninformation about\ncertain of our legal\nand regulatory\nproceedings and\ninvestigations. We\nhave seen legal claims\nby consumers and\nclients increase in a\nmarket downturn and\nemployment-related\nclaims increase\nfollowing periods in\nwhich we have reduced\nour headcount.\nAdditionally,\ngovernmental entities\nhave been plaintiffs\nand are parties in\ncertain of our legal\nproceedings, and we\nmay face future civil\nor criminal actions or\nclaims by the same or\nother governmental\nentities, as well as\nfollow-on civil\nlitigation that is\noften commenced after\nregulatory\nsettlements.\n\nSignificant\nsettlements by several\nlarge financial\ninstitutions,\nincluding, in some\ncases, us, with\ngovernmental entities\nhave been publicly\nannounced. The trend\nof large settlements\nwith governmental\nentities may adversely\naffect the outcomes\nfor other financial\ninstitutions,\nincluding, in some\ncases, us, in similar\nactions, especially\nwhere governmental\nofficials have\nannounced that the\nlarge settlements will\nbe used as the basis\nor a template for\nother settlements. The\nuncertain regulatory\nenforcement\nenvironment makes it\ndifficult to estimate\nprobable losses, which\ncan lead to\nsubstantial\ndisparities between\nlegal reserves and\nsubsequent actual\nsettlements or\npenalties.\n\nClaims of collusion or\nanti-competitive\nconduct have become\nmore common. Financial\ninstitutions\n(including us) have\nbeen subject to civil\ncases and\ninvestigatory demands\nrelating to alleged\nbid-rigging, group\nboycotts or other\nanti-competitive\npractices. Antitrust\nlaws generally provide\nfor joint and several\nliability and treble\ndamages.

Any such\nresolution of a\ncriminal matter\ninvolving us or our\nemployees could lead\nto increased exposure\nto civil litigation,\ncould adversely affect\nour reputation, could\nresult in penalties or\nlimitations on our\nability to conduct our\nactivities generally\nor in certain\ncircumstances and\ncould have other\nnegative effects.\nFurther, as a result\nof this type of\nsettlement, we are no\nlonger a \u201cwell-known\nseasoned issuer,\u201d\nwhich places\nlimitations on the\nmanner in which we can\nmarket our securities.\n\nIn conducting our\nbusinesses around the\nworld, we are subject\nto political, legal,\nregulatory and other\nrisks that are\ninherent in operating\nin many countries.\n\nIn conducting our\nbusinesses and\nsupporting our global\noperations, we are\nsubject to risks of\npossible\nnationalization,\nexpropriation, price\ncontrols, capital\ncontrols, exchange\ncontrols,\ncommunications and\nother content\nrestrictions, and\nother restrictive\ngovernmental actions.\nFor example, sanctions\nhave been imposed by\nthe U.S. and the E.U.\non certain individuals\nand companies in\nRussia and Venezuela.\nIn many countries, the\nlaws and regulations\napplicable to the\nsecurities and\nfinancial services\nindustries and many of\nthe transactions in\nwhich we are involved\nare uncertain and\nevolving, and it may\nbe difficult for us to\ndetermine the exact\nrequirements of local\nlaws in every market.\nWe have been in some\ncases subject to\ndivergent and\nconflicting laws and\nregulations across\nmarkets, and we are\nincreasingly subject\nto the risk that the\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate have\nimplemented or may\nimplement laws and\nregulations that\ndirectly conflict with\nthose of another\njurisdiction. Any\ndetermination by local\nregulators that we\nhave not acted in\ncompliance with the\napplication of local\nlaws in a particular\nmarket or our failure\nto develop effective\nworking relationships\nwith local regulators\ncould have a\nsignificant and\nnegative effect not\nonly on our businesses\nin that market, but\nalso on our reputation\ngenerally.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe application of\nregulatory strategies\nand requirements in\nthe U.S. and non-U.S.\njurisdictions to\nfacilitate the orderly\nresolution of large\nfinancial institutions\ncould create greater\nrisk of loss for Group\nInc.\u2019s security\nholders.\n\nAs described in\n\u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\n\u2014 Banking Supervision\nand Regulation \u2014\nInsolvency of an IDI\nor a BHC,\u201d if the FDIC\nis appointed as\nreceiver under OLA,\nthe rights of Group\nInc.\u2019s creditors would\nbe determined under\nOLA, and substantial\ndifferences exist in\nthe rights of\ncreditors between OLA\nand the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code,\nincluding the right of\nthe FDIC under OLA to\ndisregard the strict\npriority of creditor\nclaims in some\ncircumstances, which\ncould have a material\nadverse effect on our\ndebtholders.\n\nThe FDIC has announced\nthat a single point of\nentry strategy may be\na desirable strategy\nunder OLA to resolve a\nlarge financial\ninstitution in a\nmanner that would,\namong other things,\nimpose losses on\nshareholders,\ndebtholders and other\ncreditors of the top-\ntier BHC (in our case,\nGroup Inc.), while the\nBHC\u2019s subsidiaries may\ncontinue to operate.\nIt is possible that\nthe application of the\nsingle point of entry\nstrategy under OLA, in\nwhich Group Inc. would\nbe the only entity to\nenter resolution\nproceedings (and its\nmaterial broker-\ndealer, bank and other\noperating entities\nwould not enter\nresolution\nproceedings), would\nresult in greater\nlosses to Group Inc.\u2019s\nsecurity holders\n(including holders of\nour fixed rate,\nfloating rate and\nindexed debt\nsecurities), than the\nlosses that would\nresult from the\napplication of a\nbankruptcy proceeding\nor a different\nresolution strategy,\nsuch as a multiple\npoint of entry\nresolution strategy\nfor Group Inc. and\ncertain of its\nmaterial subsidiaries.\n\nAssuming Group Inc.\nentered resolution\nproceedings and that\nsupport from Group\nInc. or other\navailable resources to\nits subsidiaries was\nsufficient to enable\nthe subsidiaries to\nremain solvent, losses\nat the subsidiary\nlevel would be\ntransferred to Group\nInc. and ultimately\nborne by Group Inc.\u2019s\nsecurity holders,\nthird-party creditors\nof Group Inc.\u2019s\nsubsidiaries would\nreceive full\nrecoveries on their\nclaims, and Group\nInc.\u2019s security\nholders (including our\nshareholders,\ndebtholders and other\nunsecured creditors)\ncould face significant\nand possibly complete\nlosses. In that case,\nGroup Inc.\u2019s security\nholders would face\nlosses while the\nthird-party creditors\nof Group Inc.\u2019s\nsubsidiaries would\nincur no losses\nbecause the\nsubsidiaries would\ncontinue to operate\nand would not enter\nresolution or\nbankruptcy\nproceedings. In\naddition, holders of\nGroup Inc.\u2019s eligible\nlong-term debt and\nholders of Group\nInc.\u2019s other debt\nsecurities could face\nlosses ahead of its\nother similarly\nsituated creditors in\na resolution under OLA\nif the FDIC exercised\nits right, described\nabove, to disregard\nthe priority of\ncreditor claims.\n\nOLA also provides the\nFDIC with authority to\ncause creditors and\nshareholders of the\nfinancial company in\nreceivership to bear\nlosses before\ntaxpayers are exposed\nto such losses, and\namounts owed to the\nU.S. government would\ngenerally receive a\nstatutory payment\npriority over the\nclaims of private\ncreditors, including\nsenior creditors.\n\nIn addition, under\nOLA, claims of\ncreditors (including\ndebtholders) could be\nsatisfied through the\nissuance of equity or\nother securities in a\nbridge entity to which\nGroup Inc.\u2019s assets\nare transferred. If\nsuch a securities-for-\nclaims exchange were\nimplemented, there can\nbe no assurance that\nthe value of the\nsecurities of the\nbridge entity would be\nsufficient to repay or\nsatisfy all or any\npart of the creditor\nclaims for which the\nsecurities were\nexchanged. While the\nFDIC has issued\nregulations to\nimplement OLA, not all\naspects of how the\nFDIC might exercise\nthis authority are\nknown and additional\nrulemaking is\npossible.\n\nIn addition, certain\njurisdictions,\nincluding the U.K. and\nthe E.U., have\nimplemented resolution\nregimes to provide\nresolution authorities\nwith the ability to\nrecapitalize a failing\nentity by writing down\nits unsecured debt or\nconverting its\nunsecured debt into\nequity. Such \u201cbail-in\u201d\npowers are intended to\nenable the\nrecapitalization of a\nfailing institution by\nallocating losses to\nits shareholders and\nunsecured debtholders.\nFor example, the Bank\nof England requires a\ncertain amount of\nintercompany funding\nthat we provide to our\nmaterial U.K.\nsubsidiaries to\ncontain a contractual\ntrigger to expressly\npermit the Bank of\nEngland to exercise\nsuch \u201cbail-in\u201d powers\nin certain\ncircumstances. If the\nintercompany funding\nwe provide to our\nsubsidiaries is\n\u201cbailed in,\u201d Group\nInc.\u2019s claims on its\nsubsidiaries would be\nsubordinated to the\nclaims of the\nsubsidiaries\u2019 third-\nparty creditors or\nwritten down. U.S.\nregulators are\nconsidering and\nnon-U.S. authorities\nhave adopted\nrequirements that\ncertain subsidiaries\nof large financial\ninstitutions maintain\nminimum amounts of\ntotal loss-absorbing\ncapacity that would\npass losses up from\nthe subsidiaries to\nthe top-tier BHC and,\nultimately, to\nsecurity holders of\nthe top-tier BHC in\nthe event of failure.\n                                      \n  46    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe application of\nGroup Inc.\u2019s proposed\nresolution strategy\ncould result in\ngreater losses for\nGroup Inc.\u2019s security\nholders.\n\nIn our resolution\nplan, Group Inc. would\nbe resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nThe strategy described\nin our resolution plan\nis a variant of the\nsingle point of entry\nstrategy: Group Inc.\nand Goldman Sachs\nFunding LLC (Funding\nIHC), a wholly-owned,\ndirect subsidiary of\nGroup Inc., would\nrecapitalize and\nprovide liquidity to\ncertain major\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding through the\nforgiveness of\nintercompany\nindebtedness, the\nextension of the\nmaturities of\nintercompany\nindebtedness and the\nextension of\nadditional\nintercompany loans. If\nthis strategy were\nsuccessful, creditors\nof some or all of\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nsubsidiaries would\nreceive full\nrecoveries on their\nclaims, while Group\nInc.\u2019s security\nholders could face\nsignificant and\npossibly complete\nlosses.\n\nTo facilitate the\nexecution of our\nresolution plan, we\nformed Funding IHC. In\nexchange for an\nunsecured subordinated\nfunding note and\nequity interest, Group\nInc. transferred\ncertain intercompany\nreceivables and\nsubstantially all of\nits GCLA to Funding\nIHC, and agreed to\ntransfer additional\nGCLA above prescribed\nthresholds.\n\nWe also put in place a\nCapital and Liquidity\nSupport Agreement\n(CLSA) among Group\nInc., Funding IHC and\nour major\nsubsidiaries. Under\nthe CLSA, Funding IHC\nhas provided Group\nInc. with a committed\nline of credit that\nallows Group Inc. to\ndraw sufficient funds\nto meet its cash needs\nduring the ordinary\ncourse of business. In\naddition, if our\nfinancial resources\ndeteriorate so\nseverely that\nresolution may be\nimminent, (i) the\ncommitted line of\ncredit will\nautomatically\nterminate and the\nunsecured subordinated\nfunding note will\nautomatically be\nforgiven, (ii) all\nintercompany\nreceivables owed by\nthe major subsidiaries\nto Group Inc. will be\ntransferred to Funding\nIHC or their\nmaturities will be\nextended to five\nyears, (iii) Group\nInc. will be obligated\nto transfer\nsubstantially all of\nits remaining\nintercompany\nreceivables and GCLA\n(other than an amount\nto fund anticipated\nbankruptcy expenses)\nto Funding IHC, and\n(iv) Funding IHC will\nbe obligated to\nprovide capital and\nliquidity support to\nthe major\nsubsidiaries. Group\nInc.\u2019s and Funding\nIHC\u2019s obligations\nunder the CLSA are\nsecured pursuant to a\nrelated security\nagreement. Such\nactions would\nmaterially and\nadversely affect Group\nInc.\u2019s liquidity. As a\nresult, during a\nperiod of severe\nstress, Group Inc.\nmight commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nat an earlier time\nthan it otherwise\nwould if the CLSA and\nrelated security\nagreement had not been\nimplemented.\n\nIf Group Inc.\u2019s\nproposed resolution\nstrategy were\nsuccessful, Group\nInc.\u2019s security\nholders could face\nlosses while the\nthird-party creditors\nof Group Inc.\u2019s major\nsubsidiaries would\nincur no losses\nbecause those\nsubsidiaries would\ncontinue to operate\nand not enter\nresolution or\nbankruptcy\nproceedings. As part\nof the strategy, Group\nInc. could also seek\nto elevate the\npriority of its\nguarantee obligations\nrelating to its major\nsubsidiaries\u2019\nderivative contracts\nor transfer them to\nanother entity so that\ncross-default and\nearly termination\nrights would be stayed\nunder the ISDA\nProtocols, as\napplicable, which\nwould result in\nholders of Group\nInc.\u2019s eligible long-\nterm debt and holders\nof Group Inc.\u2019s other\ndebt securities\nincurring losses ahead\nof the beneficiaries\nof those guarantee\nobligations. It is\nalso possible that\nholders of Group\nInc.\u2019s eligible long-\nterm debt and other\ndebt securities could\nincur losses ahead of\nother similarly\nsituated creditors of\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nsubsidiaries.\n\nIf Group Inc.\u2019s\nproposed resolution\nstrategy were not\nsuccessful, Group\nInc.\u2019s financial\ncondition would be\nadversely impacted and\nGroup Inc.\u2019s security\nholders, including\ndebtholders, may as a\nconsequence be in a\nworse position than if\nthe strategy had not\nbeen implemented. In\nall cases, any\npayments to\ndebtholders are\ndependent on our\nability to make such\npayments and are\ntherefore subject to\nour credit risk.\n\nAs a result of our\nrecovery and\nresolution planning\nprocesses, including\nincorporating feedback\nfrom our regulators,\nwe may incur increased\noperational, funding\nor other costs and\nface limitations on\nour ability to\nstructure our internal\norganization or engage\nin internal or\nexternal activities in\na manner that we may\notherwise deem most\noperationally\nefficient.\n\nOur commodities\nactivities,\nparticularly our\nphysical commodities\nactivities, subject us\nto extensive\nregulation and involve\ncertain potential\nrisks, including\nenvironmental,\nreputational and other\nrisks that may expose\nus to significant\nliabilities and costs.\n\nAs part of our\ncommodities business,\nwe purchase and sell\ncertain physical\ncommodities, arrange\nfor their storage and\ntransport, and engage\nin market making of\ncommodities.

As a result,\nwe have had to commit\ncapital to support our\ninternational\noperations and to\nexecute large global\ntransactions. As we\nhave expanded into new\nbusiness areas and new\ngeographic regions, we\nhave faced competitors\nwith more experience\nand more established\nrelationships with\nclients, regulators\nand industry\nparticipants in the\nrelevant market, which\ncould adversely affect\nour ability to expand\nour businesses.\n                                      \n  48    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For\nexample, in connection\nwith investment\nbanking and other\nassignments, in\nresponse to\ncompetitive pressure\nwe have experienced,\nwe have extended and\npriced credit at\nlevels that in some\ncases have not fully\ncompensated us for the\nrisks we undertook.\n\nThe financial services\nindustry is highly\ninterrelated in that a\nsignificant volume of\ntransactions occur\namong a limited number\nof members of that\nindustry. Many\ntransactions are\nsyndicated to other\nfinancial\ninstitutions, and\nfinancial institutions\nare often\ncounterparties in\ntransactions. This has\nled to claims by other\nmarket participants\nand regulators that\nsuch institutions have\ncolluded in order to\nmanipulate markets or\nmarket prices,\nincluding allegations\nthat antitrust laws\nhave been violated.\nWhile we have\nextensive procedures\nand controls that are\ndesigned to identify\nand prevent such\nactivities, they may\nnot be effective.\nAllegations of such\nactivities,\nparticularly by\nregulators, can have a\nnegative reputational\nimpact and can subject\nus to large fines and\nsettlements, and\npotentially\nsignificant penalties,\nincluding treble\ndamages.\n\nThe growth of\nelectronic trading and\nthe introduction of\nnew products and\ntechnologies,\nincluding trading and\ndistributed ledger\ntechnologies,\nincluding\ncryptocurrencies, has\nincreased competition.\n\nTechnology is\nfundamental to our\nbusiness and our\nindustry. The growth\nof electronic trading\nand the introduction\nof new technologies is\nchanging our\nbusinesses and\npresenting us with new\nchallenges.\nSecurities, futures\nand options\ntransactions are\nincreasingly occurring\nelectronically, both\non our own systems and\nthrough other\nalternative trading\nsystems, and it\nappears that the trend\ntoward alternative\ntrading systems will\ncontinue. Some of\nthese alternative\ntrading systems\ncompete with us,\nparticularly our\nexchange-based market-\nmaking activities, and\nwe may experience\ncontinued competitive\npressures in these and\nother areas. In\naddition, the\nincreased use by our\nclients of low-cost\nelectronic trading\nsystems and direct\nelectronic access to\ntrading markets could\ncause a reduction in\ncommissions and\nspreads. As our\nclients increasingly\nuse our systems to\ntrade directly in the\nmarkets, we may incur\nliabilities as a\nresult of their use of\nour order routing and\nexecution\ninfrastructure.\n\nWe have invested\nsignificant resources\ninto the development\nof electronic trading\nsystems and expect to\ncontinue to do so, but\nthere is no assurance\nthat the revenues\ngenerated by these\nsystems will yield an\nadequate return,\nparticularly given the\ngenerally lower\ncommissions arising\nfrom electronic\ntrades.\n\nIn addition, the\nemergence, adoption\nand evolution of new\ntechnologies,\nincluding distributed\nledgers, such as\ndigital assets and\nblockchain, have\nrequired us to invest\nresources to adapt our\nexisting products and\nservices, and we\nexpect to continue to\nmake such investments,\nwhich could be\nmaterial. The adoption\nand evolution of such\nnew technologies may\nalso increase our\ncompliance and\nregulatory costs.\nFurther, technologies,\nsuch as those based on\ndistributed ledgers,\nthat do not require\nintermediation could\nalso significantly\ndisrupt payments\nprocessing and other\nfinancial services.\nRegulatory limitations\non our involvement in\nproducts and platforms\ninvolving digital\nassets and distributed\nledger technologies\nmay not apply equally\nor in some cases at\nall to certain of our\ncompetitors. We may\nnot be as timely or\nsuccessful in\ndeveloping or\nintegrating, or even\nable to develop or\nintegrate, new\nproducts and\ntechnologies, such as\nthose built on\ndistributed ledgers,\ninto our existing\nproducts and services,\nadapting to changes in\nconsumer preferences\nor achieving market\nacceptance of our\nproducts and services,\nany of which could\naffect our ability to\nattract or retain\nclients, cause us to\nlose market share or\nresult in service\ndisruptions and in\nturn reduce our\nrevenues or otherwise\nadversely affect us.\n\nOur businesses would\nbe adversely affected\nif we are unable to\nhire and retain\nqualified employees.\n\nOur performance is\nlargely dependent on\nthe talents and\nefforts of highly\nskilled people;\ntherefore, our\ncontinued ability to\ncompete effectively in\nour businesses, to\nmanage our businesses\neffectively and to\nexpand into new\nbusinesses and\ngeographic areas\ndepends on our ability\nto attract new\ntalented and diverse\nemployees and to\nretain and motivate\nour existing\nemployees.

This is\nalso the case in\nemerging and growth\nmarkets, where we are\noften competing for\nqualified employees\nwith entities that\nhave a significantly\ngreater presence or\nmore extensive\nexperience in the\nregion.\n\nLaws or regulations in\njurisdictions in which\nour operations are\nlocated that affect\ntaxes on our\nemployees\u2019 income or\nthe amount or\ncomposition of\ncompensation, or that\nrequire us to disclose\nour or our\ncompetitors\u2019\ncompensation\npractices, may also\nadversely affect our\nability to hire and\nretain qualified\nemployees in those\njurisdictions.\n\nAs described further\nin \u201cBusiness \u2014\nRegulation\n\u2014Compensation\nPractices\u201d in Part I,\nItem 1 of this Form\n10-K, our compensation\npractices are subject\nto review by, and the\nstandards of, the FRB.\nAs a large global\nfinancial and banking\ninstitution, we are\nsubject to limitations\non compensation\npractices (which may\nor may not affect the\ncompanies with which\nwe compete for talent)\nby the FRB, the PRA,\nthe FCA, the FDIC and\nother regulators\nworldwide. These\nlimitations have\nshaped our\ncompensation\npractices, which has,\nin some cases,\nadversely affected our\nability to attract and\nretain talented\nemployees, in\nparticular in relation\nto companies not\nsubject to these\nlimitations, and\nfuture legislation or\nregulation may have\nsimilar adverse\neffects.\n\nOur operating expenses\nand efficiency ratio\ndepend, in part, on\nour overall headcount\nand the proportion of\nour employees located\nin strategic\nlocations.

These\nevents could have such\neffects through\neconomic or financial\nmarket disruptions or\nchallenging economic\nor market conditions\nmore generally, the\ndeterioration of our\ncreditworthiness or\nthat of our\ncounterparties,\nchanges in consumer\nsentiment and consumer\nborrowing, spending\nand savings patterns,\nliquidity stress, or\noperational\ndifficulties (such as\ntravel limitations and\nlimitations on\noccupancy in our\noffices) that impair\nour ability to manage\nour businesses.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\ncreated economic and\nfinancial disruptions\nthat have in the past\nadversely affected and\nmay in the future\nadversely affect our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition, liquidity\nand results of\noperations. The extent\nto which the COVID-19\npandemic will\nnegatively affect our\nbusinesses, financial\ncondition, liquidity\nand results of\noperations will depend\non, among other\nthings, future\ndevelopments,\nincluding any\nresurgence of COVID-19\ncases, the emergence\nof new variants of\nCOVID-19 and the\neffectiveness of\nvaccines and\ntreatments over the\nlong term and against\nnew variants, which\nare highly uncertain\nand cannot be\npredicted.\n\nClimate change could\ndisrupt our businesses\nand adversely affect\nclient activity levels\nand the\ncreditworthiness of\nour clients and\ncounterparties, and\nour efforts to address\nconcerns relating to\nclimate change could\nresult in damage to\nour reputation.\n\nClimate change may\ncause extreme weather\nevents that disrupt\noperations at one or\nmore of our primary\nlocations, which may\nnegatively affect our\nability to service and\ninteract with our\nclients, adversely\naffect the value of\nour investments,\nincluding our real\nestate investments,\nand reduce the\navailability or\nincrease the cost of\ninsurance. Climate\nchange and the\ntransition to a less\ncarbon-dependent\neconomy may also have\na negative impact on\nthe operations or\nfinancial condition of\nour clients and\ncounterparties, which\nmay decrease revenues\nfrom those clients and\ncounterparties and\nincrease the credit\nrisk associated with\nloans and other credit\nexposures to those\nclients and\ncounterparties.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe are also exposed to\nrisks resulting from\nchanges in public\npolicy, laws and\nregulations, or market\nand public perceptions\nand preferences in\nconnection with the\ntransition to a less\ncarbon-dependent\neconomy. These changes\ncould adversely affect\nour business, results\nof operations and\nreputation. For\nexample, our\nreputation and client\nrelationships may be\ndamaged as a result of\nour or our clients\u2019\ninvolvement in, or\ndecision not to\nparticipate in,\ncertain industries or\nprojects associated\nwith causing or\nexacerbating climate\nchange, as well as any\ndecisions we make to\ncontinue to conduct or\nchange our activities\nin response to\nconsiderations\nrelating to climate\nchange. If we are\nunable to achieve our\nobjectives relating to\nclimate change or our\nresponse to climate\nchange is perceived to\nbe ineffective,\ninsufficient or\notherwise\ninappropriate, our\nbusiness, reputation\nand efforts to recruit\nand retain employees\nmay suffer.\n\nNew regulations or\nguidance relating to\nclimate change, as\nwell as the\nperspectives of\ngovernment officials,\nregulators,\nshareholders,\nemployees and other\nstakeholders regarding\nclimate change, may\naffect whether and on\nwhat terms and\nconditions we engage\nin certain activities\nor offer certain\nproducts. Federal and\nstate, and non-U.S.\nbanking regulators and\nsupervisory\nauthorities,\nshareholders and other\nstakeholders have\nincreasingly viewed\nfinancial institutions\nas playing an\nimportant role in\nhelping to address\nrisks related to\nclimate change, both\ndirectly and with\nrespect to their\nclients, which may\nresult in financial\ninstitutions coming\nunder increased\nrequirements and\nexpectations regarding\nthe disclosure and\nmanagement of their\nclimate risks and\nrelated lending,\ninvestment and\nadvisory activities.\nThe FRB has announced\nthat we are among the\nsix U.S. financial\ninstitutions\nparticipating in a\npilot climate scenario\nanalysis exercise in\n2023, and we also are\nsubject to new or\nheightened regulatory\nrequirements relating\nto climate change,\nsuch as requirements\nrelating to\noperational resiliency\nor stress testing for\nvarious climate stress\nscenarios. Any such\nnew or heightened\nrequirements could\nresult in increased\nregulatory, compliance\nor other costs or\nhigher capital\nrequirements. The\nrisks associated with,\nand the perspective of\nregulators,\nshareholders,\nemployees and other\nstakeholders\nregarding, climate\nchange are continuing\nto evolve rapidly,\nwhich can make it\ndifficult to assess\nthe ultimate impact on\nus of climate change-\nrelated risks and\nuncertainties, and we\nexpect that climate\nchange-related risks\nwill increase over\ntime.\n\nOur business,\nfinancial condition,\nliquidity and results\nof operations may be\nadversely affected by\ndisruptions in the\nglobal economy caused\nby Russia\u2019s invasion\nof Ukraine and related\nsanctions and other\ndevelopments.\n\nThe war between Russia\nand Ukraine has\nnegatively affected\nthe global economy.\nGovernments around the\nworld have responded\nto Russia\u2019s invasion\nby imposing economic\nsanctions and export\ncontrols on certain\nindustry sectors,\nincluding price caps\non Russian oil, and\nparties in Russia.\nCompliance with\neconomic sanctions and\nrestrictions imposed\nby governments has\nincreased our costs\nand otherwise\nadversely affected our\nbusiness and may\ncontinue to do so.\nRussia has responded\nwith its own\nrestrictions against\ninvestors and\ncountries outside\nRussia and has\nproposed additional\nmeasures aimed at non-\nRussia owned\nbusinesses. Businesses\nin the U.S. and\nglobally have\nexperienced shortages\nin materials and\nincreased costs for\ntransportation,\nenergy, and raw\nmaterials due in part\nto the negative\neffects of the war on\nthe global economy.\nThe escalation or\ncontinuation of the\nwar between Russia and\nUkraine or other\nhostilities could\nresult in, among other\nthings, further\nincreased risk of\ncyber attacks, an\nincreased frequency\nand volume of failures\nto settle securities\ntransactions, supply\nchain disruptions,\nhigher inflation,\nlower consumer demand\nand increased\nvolatility in\ncommodity, currency\nand other financial\nmarkets.\n\nThe extent and\nduration of the war,\nsanctions and\nresulting market\ndisruptions are\nimpossible to predict,\nand the consequences\nfor our business could\nbe significant.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCertain of our\nbusinesses, our\nfunding instruments\nand financial products\nmay be adversely\naffected by changes in\nor the discontinuance\nof Interbank Offered\nRates (IBORs), in\nparticular USD LIBOR.\n\nOn January 1, 2022,\nthe publication of all\nEUR, CHF, JPY and GBP\nLIBOR (non-USD LIBOR)\nsettings along with\ncertain USD LIBOR\nsettings ceased. The\npublication of the\nmost commonly used USD\nLIBOR settings as\nrepresentative rates\nwill cease after June\n2023. The FCA proposed\nthat certain of those\nUSD LIBOR settings\ncontinue to be\npublished on a\nsynthetic basis\nthrough September\n2024. The FCA has\nallowed the\npublication and use of\nsynthetic rates for\ncertain GBP LIBOR\nsettings in legacy GBP\nLIBOR-based derivative\ncontracts through\nMarch 2024.\n\nThe International\nSwaps and Derivatives\nAssociation (ISDA)\n2020 IBOR Fallbacks\nProtocol (IBOR\nProtocol) has provided\nderivatives market\nparticipants with\namended fallbacks for\nlegacy and new\nderivative contracts\nto mitigate legal or\neconomic uncertainty.\nBoth counterparties\nhave to adhere to the\nIBOR Protocol or\nengage in bilateral\namendments for the\nterms to be effective\nfor derivative\ncontracts. ISDA has\nconfirmed that the\nFCA\u2019s formal\nannouncement to cease\nboth non-USD and USD\nLIBOR settings fixed\nthe spread adjustment\nfor all LIBOR rates\nand as a result\nfallbacks applied\nautomatically for non-\nUSD LIBOR settings\nfollowing December 31,\n2021 and will apply\nautomatically for USD\nLIBOR settings\nfollowing June 30,\n2023. The Adjustable\nInterest Rate (LIBOR)\nAct (LIBOR Act), that\nwas enacted in March\n2022, provides a\nstatutory framework to\nreplace USD LIBOR with\na benchmark rate based\non the Secured\nOvernight Financing\nRate (SOFR) for\ncontracts governed by\nU.S. law that have no\nfallbacks or fallbacks\nthat would require the\nuse of a poll or\nLIBOR-based rate. In\nDecember 2022, the FRB\nadopted a final rule\nthat implements the\nLIBOR Act, which will\nbecome effective on\nFebruary 27, 2023. The\nfinal rule identifies\ndifferent SOFR-based\nreplacement rates for\nderivative contracts,\nfor cash instruments\nsuch as floating-rate\nnotes and preferred\nstock, for consumer\ncontracts, for certain\ngovernment-sponsored\nenterprise contracts\nand for certain\nstudent loan\nsecuritizations that\nlack a fallback to an\nalternative rate when\nUSD LIBOR ceases to be\npublished on June 30,\n2023. As the\ntransition from LIBOR\nis ongoing, there\ncontinues to be\nuncertainty as to the\nultimate effect of the\ntransition on the\nfinancial markets for\nLIBOR-linked financial\ninstruments. Similar\ndevelopments have\noccurred with respect\nto other IBORs.\n\nThe language in our\ncontracts and\nfinancial instruments\nthat define IBORs, in\nparticular LIBOR, have\ndeveloped over time\nand have various\nevents that trigger\nwhen a successor rate\nto the designated rate\nwould be selected.\nOnce a trigger is\nsatisfied, contracts\nand financial\ninstruments often give\nthe calculation agent\n(which may be us)\ndiscretion over the\nsuccessor rate or\nbenchmark to be\nselected. Although the\nLIBOR Act includes\nsafe harbors if the\nFRB-identified SOFR-\nbased replacement rate\nis selected, these\nsafe harbors are\nuntested. As a result,\nand despite the\nenactment of the LIBOR\nAct, for the most\ncommonly used USD\nLIBOR settings, the\nselection of a\nsuccessor rate could\nresult in client\ndisputes and\nlitigation surrounding\nthe proper\ninterpretation of our\nIBOR-based contracts\nand financial\ninstruments.\nDiscretionary actions\ntaken in connection\nwith the\nimplementation of\nfallback provisions\ncould also result in\nclient disputes and\nlitigation\nparticularly for\nderivatives and other\nsynthetic instruments.\n\nChanges in, the\ndiscontinuation of, or\nchanges in market\nacceptance of any\nIBOR, particularly USD\nLIBOR, as a reference\nrate may adversely\naffect certain of our\nbusinesses, our\nfunding instruments\nand financial\nproducts.\n\nCertain of our\nbusinesses and our\nfunding instruments\nmay be adversely\naffected by changes in\nother reference rates,\ncurrencies, indexes,\nbaskets or ETFs to\nwhich products we\noffer or funding that\nwe raise are linked.\n\nMany of the products\nthat we own or that we\noffer, such as\nstructured notes,\nwarrants, swaps or\nsecurity-based swaps,\npay interest or\ndetermine the\nprincipal amount to be\npaid at maturity or in\nthe event of default\nby reference to rates\nor by reference to an\nindex, currency,\nbasket, ETF or other\nfinancial metric (the\nunderlier). In the\nevent that the\ncomposition of the\nunderlier is\nsignificantly changed,\nby reference to rules\ngoverning such\nunderlier or\notherwise, the\nunderlier ceases to\nexist (for example, in\nthe event that a\ncountry withdraws from\nthe Euro or links its\ncurrency to or delinks\nits currency from\nanother currency or\nbenchmark, an index or\nETF sponsor materially\nalters the composition\nof an index or ETF, or\nstocks in a basket are\ndelisted or become\nimpermissible to be\nincluded in the index\nor ETF), the underlier\nceases to be\nrecognized as an\nacceptable market\nbenchmark or there are\nlegal or regulatory\nconstraints on linking\na financial instrument\nto the underlier, we\nmay experience adverse\neffects.\n                                      \n  52    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Any of the\nforegoing could\nadversely affect our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition, liquidity\nand results of\noperations, possibly\nmaterially.\n\nWe face enhanced risks\nas new business\ninitiatives and\nacquisitions lead us\nto engage in new\nactivities, operate in\nnew locations,\ntransact with a\nbroader array of\nclients and\ncounterparties and\nexpose us to new asset\nclasses and new\nmarkets.\n\nA number of our recent\nand planned business\ninitiatives and\nexpansions of existing\nbusinesses, including\nthrough acquisitions\nand partnership\narrangements, could\ncontinue to bring us\ninto contact, directly\nor indirectly, with\nindividuals and\nentities that are not\nwithin our traditional\nclient and\ncounterparty base,\nexpose us to new asset\nclasses and new\nmarkets, and present\nus with integration\nchallenges. For\nexample, we continue\nto transact business\nand invest in new\nregions, including a\nwide range of emerging\nand growth markets,\nand we expect this\ntrend to continue.\nVarious emerging and\ngrowth market\ncountries have\nexperienced severe\neconomic and financial\ndisruptions, including\nsignificant\ndevaluations of their\ncurrencies, defaults\nor threatened defaults\non sovereign debt,\ncapital and currency\nexchange controls, and\nlow or negative growth\nrates in their\neconomies. The\npossible effects of\nany of these\nconditions include an\nadverse impact on our\nbusinesses and\nincreased volatility\nin financial markets\ngenerally.\n\nFurthermore, in a\nnumber of our\nbusinesses, including\nwhere we make markets,\ninvest and lend, we\nown interests in, or\notherwise become\naffiliated with the\nownership and\noperation of, public\nservices, such as\nairports, toll roads\nand shipping ports, as\nwell as physical\ncommodities and\ncommodities\ninfrastructure\ncomponents, both\nwithin and outside the\nU.S.\n\nWe have increased our\nconsumer-oriented\ndeposit-taking and\nlending activities.\nFor example, we now\nissue credit cards to\nconsumers and through\nour acquisition of\nGreenSky, Inc.\n(GreenSky), we\nexpanded our offering\nof point-of-sale\nfinancing. To the\nextent we engage in\nthose and other\nconsumer-oriented\nactivities, we have\nfaced, and would\ncontinue to face,\nadditional compliance,\nlegal and regulatory\nrisk, increased\nreputational risk and\nincreased operational\nrisk due to, among\nother things, higher\ntransaction volumes\nand significantly\nincreased retention\nand transmission of\nconsumer and client\ninformation.\nAcquisitions and new\nproducts can also\nexpose us to new or\ndifferent types of\nrisks. For example,\nproviding point-of-\nsale financing through\nGreenSky also subjects\nus to risks relating\nto retaining and\nattracting merchants\nand servicing loans\nfor other banks, as\nwell as potential\nliability for\nremediation costs if\nmerchants fail to\nfulfill their\nobligations to\nconsumers. We are also\nsubject to additional\nlegal requirements,\nincluding with respect\nto suitability and\nconsumer protection\n(for example,\nRegulation Best\nInterest, fair lending\nlaws and regulations\nand privacy laws and\nregulations).

PropertiesIn the U.S. and    \u2502\n\u2502  elsewhere in the Americas, we have        \u2502\n\u2502  offices consisting of approximately 6.7   \u2502\n\u2502  million square feet of leased and owned   \u2502\n\u2502  space. Our principal executive offices    \u2502\n\u2502  are located at 200 West Street, New       \u2502\n\u2502  York, New York and consist of             \u2502\n\u2502  approximately 2.1 million square feet.    \u2502\n\u2502  The building is located on a parcel       \u2502\n\u2502  leased from Battery Park City Authority   \u2502\n\u2502  pursuant to a ground lease. Under the     \u2502\n\u2502  lease, Battery Park City Authority holds  \u2502\n\u2502  title to all improvements, including the  \u2502\n\u2502  office building, subject to our right of  \u2502\n\u2502  exclusive possession and use until June   \u2502\n\u2502  2069, the expiration date of the lease.   \u2502\n\u2502  Under the terms of the ground lease, we   \u2502\n\u2502  made a lump sum ground rent payment in    \u2502\n\u2502  June 2007 of $161 million for rent        \u2502\n\u2502  through the term of the lease.In Europe,  \u2502\n\u2502  the Middle East and Africa, we have       \u2502\n\u2502  offices consisting of approximately 1.8   \u2502\n\u2502  million square feet of leased and owned   \u2502\n\u2502  space. Our European headquarters is       \u2502\n\u2502  located in London at Plumtree Court,      \u2502\n\u2502  consisting of approximately 826,000       \u2502\n\u2502  square feet under a lease which can be    \u2502\n\u2502  terminated in 2039.In Asia, Australia     \u2502\n\u2502  and New Zealand, we have offices          \u2502\n\u2502  consisting of approximately 2.8 million   \u2502\n\u2502  square feet, including our offices in     \u2502\n\u2502  India, and regional headquarters in       \u2502\n\u2502  Tokyo and Hong Kong. In India, we have    \u2502\n\u2502  offices with approximately 1.7 million    \u2502\n\u2502  square feet, the majority of which have   \u2502\n\u2502  leases that will expire in 2028.In the    \u2502\n\u2502  preceding paragraphs, square footage      \u2502\n\u2502  figures are provided only for properties  \u2502\n\u2502  that are used in the operation of our     \u2502\n\u2502  businesses. We regularly evaluate our     \u2502\n\u2502  space capacity in relation to current     \u2502\n\u2502  and projected headcount. We may incur     \u2502\n\u2502  exit costs in the future if we (i)        \u2502\n\u2502  reduce our space capacity or (ii) commit  \u2502\n\u2502  to, or occupy, new properties in          \u2502\n\u2502  locations in which we operate and         \u2502\n\u2502  dispose of existing space that had been   \u2502\n\u2502  held for potential growth.

Legal ProceedingsWe are          \u2502\n\u2502  involved in a number of judicial,         \u2502\n\u2502  regulatory and arbitration proceedings    \u2502\n\u2502  concerning matters arising in connection  \u2502\n\u2502  with the conduct of our businesses. Many  \u2502\n\u2502  of these proceedings are in early         \u2502\n\u2502  stages, and many of these cases seek an   \u2502\n\u2502  indeterminate amount of damages. We have  \u2502\n\u2502  estimated the upper end of the range of   \u2502\n\u2502  reasonably possible aggregate loss for    \u2502\n\u2502  matters where we have been able to        \u2502\n\u2502  estimate a range and we believe, based    \u2502\n\u2502  on currently available information, that  \u2502\n\u2502  the results of matters where we have not  \u2502\n\u2502  been able to estimate a range of          \u2502\n\u2502  reasonably possible loss, in the          \u2502\n\u2502  aggregate, will not have a material       \u2502\n\u2502  adverse effect on our financial           \u2502\n\u2502  condition, but may be material to our     \u2502\n\u2502  operating results in a given period.      \u2502\n\u2502  Given the range of litigation and         \u2502\n\u2502  investigations presently under way, our   \u2502\n\u2502  litigation expenses may remain high.

Governments\naround the world\nresponded to Russia\u2019s\ninvasion of Ukraine by\nimposing economic\nsanctions, and global\ncentral banks sought\nto address inflation\nby increasing policy\ninterest rates several\ntimes over the course\nof the year. These\nfactors contributed to\nincreased market\nvolatility during the\nyear, as well as a\ndecrease in global\nequity and bond prices\nand wider corporate\ncredit spreads\ncompared with the end\nof 2021.\n\nThe economic outlook\nremains uncertain,\nreflecting concerns\nabout the continuation\nor escalation of the\nwar between Russia and\nUkraine and other\ngeopolitical risks,\ninflation, and supply\nchain complications.\nSee \u201cResults of\nOperations \u2014 Segment\nAssets and Operating\nResults \u2014 Segment\nOperating Results\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout the operating\nenvironment for each\nof our business\nsegments.\n                                              \n  Critical Accounting Policies                \n                                              \n                                              \n  Fair Value                                  \n                                              \nFair Value Hierarchy.\nTrading assets and\nliabilities, certain\ninvestments and loans,\nand certain other\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities, are\nincluded in our\nconsolidated balance\nsheets at fair value\n(i.e., marked-to-\nmarket), with related\ngains or losses\ngenerally recognized\nin our consolidated\nstatements of\nearnings. The use of\nfair value to measure\nfinancial instruments\nis fundamental to our\nrisk management\npractices and is our\nmost critical\naccounting policy.\n\nThe fair value of a\nfinancial instrument\nis the amount that\nwould be received to\nsell an asset or paid\nto transfer a\nliability in an\norderly transaction\nbetween market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date. We\nmeasure certain\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based\non its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit\nrisks). In determining\nfair value, the\nhierarchy under U.S.\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles\n(U.S. GAAP) gives (i)\nthe highest priority\nto unadjusted quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets for identical,\nunrestricted assets or\nliabilities (level 1\ninputs), (ii) the next\npriority to inputs\nother than level 1\ninputs that are\nobservable, either\ndirectly or indirectly\n(level 2 inputs), and\n(iii) the lowest\npriority to inputs\nthat cannot be\nobserved in market\nactivity (level 3\ninputs). In evaluating\nthe significance of a\nvaluation input, we\nconsider, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s\nnet risk exposure to\nthat input. Assets and\nliabilities are\nclassified in their\nentirety based on the\nlowest level of input\nthat is significant to\ntheir fair value\nmeasurement.\n\nThe fair values for\nsubstantially all of\nour financial assets\nand liabilities are\nbased on observable\nprices and inputs and\nare classified in\nlevels 1 and 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\nCertain level 2 and\nlevel 3 financial\nassets and liabilities\nmay require\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments that a\nmarket participant\nwould require to\narrive at fair value\nfor factors, such as\ncounterparty and our\ncredit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer\nrestrictions,\nliquidity and\nbid/offer spreads.\n\nInstruments classified\nin level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy are\nthose which require\none or more\nsignificant inputs\nthat are not\nobservable. Level 3\nfinancial assets\nrepresented 1.8% as of\nDecember 2022 and 1.6%\nas of December 2021 of\nour total assets. See\nNotes 4 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\nlevel 3 financial\nassets, including\nchanges in level 3\nfinancial assets and\nrelated fair value\nmeasurements. Absent\nevidence to the\ncontrary, instruments\nclassified in level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy are\ninitially valued at\ntransaction price,\nwhich is considered to\nbe the best initial\nestimate of fair\nvalue. Subsequent to\nthe transaction date,\nwe use other\nmethodologies to\ndetermine fair value,\nwhich vary based on\nthe type of\ninstrument. Estimating\nthe fair value of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstruments requires\njudgments to be made.\nThese judgments\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Determining the\nappropriate valuation\nmethodology and/or\nmodel for each type of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstrument;\n\n\u2022 Determining model\ninputs based on an\nevaluation of all\nrelevant empirical\nmarket data, including\nprices evidenced by\nmarket transactions,\ninterest rates, credit\nspreads, volatilities\nand correlations; and\n\n\u2022 Determining\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments, including\nthose related to\nilliquidity or\ncounterparty credit\nquality.\n\nRegardless of the\nmethodology, valuation\ninputs and assumptions\nare only changed when\ncorroborated by\nsubstantive evidence.\n\nControls Over\nValuation of Financial\nInstruments. Market\nmakers and investment\nprofessionals in our\nrevenue-producing\nunits are responsible\nfor pricing our\nfinancial instruments.\nOur control\ninfrastructure is\nindependent of the\nrevenue-producing\nunits and is\nfundamental to\nensuring that all of\nour financial\ninstruments are\nappropriately valued\nat market-clearing\nlevels. In the event\nthat there is a\ndifference of opinion\nin situations where\nestimating the fair\nvalue of financial\ninstruments requires\njudgment (e.g.,\ncalibration to market\ncomparables or trade\ncomparison, as\ndescribed below), the\nfinal valuation\ndecision is made by\nsenior managers in\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions.

The allowance\nfor credit losses is\nmeasured on a\ncollective basis for\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics using\na modeled approach and\non an asset-specific\nbasis for loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics.\n\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses takes\ninto account the\nweighted average of a\nrange of forecasts of\nfuture economic\nconditions over the\nexpected life of the\nloans and lending\ncommitments. The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. We\napply judgment in\nweighting individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including our\ninternally derived\neconomic outlook,\nmarket consensus,\nrecent macroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios. Risk\nfactors for wholesale\nloans include internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators (e.g.,\nunemployment rates and\nGDP), the borrower\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its\nfinancial obligations,\nthe borrower\u2019s country\nof risk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. In\naddition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nloan-to-value ratio,\ndebt service ratio and\nhome price index. Risk\nfactors for\ninstallment and credit\ncard loans include\nFair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators.\n                                      \n  60    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Personnel\nwithin our independent\nrisk oversight and\ncontrol functions are\nresponsible for\nforecasting the\neconomic variables\nthat underlie the\neconomic scenarios\nthat are used in the\nmodeling of expected\ncredit losses. While\nwe use the best\ninformation available\nto determine this\nestimate, future\nadjustments to the\nallowance may be\nnecessary based on,\namong other things,\nchanges in the\neconomic environment\nor variances between\nactual results and the\noriginal assumptions\nused. Loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\n\nWe also record an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on lending\ncommitments which are\nheld for investment\nthat are accounted for\nat amortized cost.\nSuch allowance is\ndetermined using the\nsame methodology as\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses, while also\ntaking into\nconsideration the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding,\nand whether such\ncommitments are\ncancellable by us.\n\nTo estimate the\npotential impact of an\nadverse macroeconomic\nenvironment on our\nallowance for credit\nlosses, we, among\nother things, compared\nthe expected credit\nlosses under the\nweighted average\nforecast used in the\ncalculation of\nallowance for credit\nlosses as of December\n2022 (which was\nweighted towards the\nbaseline and adverse\neconomic scenarios) to\nthe expected credit\nlosses under a 100%\nweighted adverse\neconomic scenario. The\nadverse economic\nscenario of the\nforecast model\nreflects a global\nrecession in 2023 and\na more aggressive\ntightening of monetary\npolicy by central\nbanks, resulting in an\neconomic contraction\nand rising\nunemployment rates. A\n100% weighting to the\nadverse economic\nscenario would have\nresulted in an\napproximate $1.0\nbillion increase in\nour allowance for\ncredit losses as of\nDecember 2022. This\nhypothetical increase\ndoes not take into\nconsideration any\npotential adjustments\nto qualitative\nreserves. The\nforecasts of\nmacroeconomic\nconditions are\ninherently uncertain\nand do not take into\naccount any other\noffsetting or\ncorrelated effects.\nThe actual credit loss\nin an adverse\nmacroeconomic\nenvironment may differ\nsignificantly from\nthis estimate. See\nNote 9 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about the\nallowance for credit\nlosses.\n                                              \n  Use of Estimates                            \n                                              \nU.S. GAAP requires us\nto make certain\nestimates and\nassumptions. In\naddition to the\nestimates we make in\nconnection with fair\nvalue measurements and\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses on loans\nand lending\ncommitments held for\ninvestment and\naccounted for at\namortized cost, the\nuse of estimates and\nassumptions is also\nimportant in\ndetermining the\naccounting for\ngoodwill and\nidentifiable\nintangible assets,\nprovisions for losses\nthat may arise from\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\n(including\ngovernmental\ninvestigations), and\naccounting for income\ntaxes.\n\nGoodwill is assessed\nfor impairment\nannually in the fourth\nquarter or more\nfrequently if events\noccur or circumstances\nchange that indicate\nan impairment may\nexist. When assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its carrying\nvalue. If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment. Estimating\nthe fair value of our\nreporting units\nrequires judgment.\nCritical inputs to the\nfair value estimates\ninclude projected\nearnings and allocated\nequity. There is\ninherent uncertainty\nin the projected\nearnings. The carrying\nvalue of each\nreporting unit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nThe estimated fair\nvalue of our Consumer\nplatforms reporting\nunit, which represents\napproximately 7.5% of\nour goodwill, was not\nsubstantially in\nexcess of its carrying\nvalue. This reporting\nunit has been\nadversely impacted by\nthe recent operating\nenvironment generally\ncharacterized by broad\nmacroeconomic\nconcerns. We will\ncontinue to closely\nmonitor it to\ndetermine whether an\nimpairment is required\nin the future. As of\nDecember 2022, the\ngoodwill related to\nthe Consumer platforms\nreporting unit was\n$482 million. See Note\n12 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about\ngoodwill. If we\nexperience a prolonged\nor severe period of\nweakness in the\nbusiness environment,\nfinancial markets, the\nperformance of one or\nmore of our reporting\nunits or our common\nstock price, or\nadditional increases\nin capital\nrequirements, our\ngoodwill could be\nimpaired in the\nfuture.\n\nIdentifiable\nintangible assets are\ntested for impairment\nwhen events or changes\nin circumstances\nsuggest that an\nasset\u2019s or asset\ngroup\u2019s carrying value\nmay not be fully\nrecoverable. Judgment\nis required to\nevaluate whether\nindications of\npotential impairment\nhave occurred, and to\ntest identifiable\nintangible assets for\nimpairment, if\nrequired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated undiscounted\ncash flows relating to\nthe asset or asset\ngroup is less than the\ncorresponding carrying\nvalue.

Operating Environment. During 2022,\nthe operating environment was characterized by\nbroad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns\nand market volatility, which contributed to a\ndecrease in global equity and bond prices and\nwider corporate credit spreads compared with\nthe end of 2021. These factors contributed to\nsolid market-making activity levels and a\ndecline in industry-wide investment banking\nactivity, particularly for underwriting. In\nthe U.S., the rate of unemployment remained\nlow and consumer spending increased slightly\ncompared with 2021. If concerns about the\neconomic outlook grow, including those about\nthe continuation or escalation of geopolitical\nconcerns, inflation and supply chain\ncomplications, and the persistence of\nCOVID-19-related effects, it may lead to a\ncontinued decline in asset prices, or a\ndecline in market-making activity levels, or a\ncontinued decline in investment banking\nactivity levels, and net revenues and\nprovision for credit losses would likely be\nnegatively impacted.

Non-Interest\nRevenues. Investment banking revenues in the\nconsolidated statements of earnings were $7.36\nbillion for 2022, 48% lower than a strong\n2021, due to significantly lower revenues in\nboth equity and debt underwriting, reflecting\na significant decline in industry-wide\nvolumes, and lower revenues in advisory,\nreflecting a decline in industry-wide\ncompleted mergers and acquisitions\ntransactions from elevated activity levels in\nthe prior year.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    63  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Our\nefficiency ratio was 53.8% for 2021. The\ndecrease in operating expenses compared with\n2021 was primarily due to lower compensation\nand benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in\noperating performance compared with a strong\nprior year). This decrease was partially\noffset by higher non-compensation expenses,\nreflecting the inclusion of NNIP and GreenSky\nand increases in transaction based expenses\nand technology expenses.

The increase in\noperating expenses compared with 2020\nprimarily reflected significantly higher\ncompensation and benefits expenses (reflecting\nstrong performance). In addition, technology\nexpenses and professional fees were\nsignificantly higher and transaction based\nexpenses were higher. These increases were\npartially offset by significantly lower net\nprovisions for litigation and regulatory\nproceedings and lower expenses related to\nconsolidated investments (including\nimpairments).

In\naddition, we maintain\n(i) market-making\npositions, typically\nfor a short period of\ntime, in response to,\nor in anticipation of,\nclient demand, and\n(ii) positions to\nactively manage our\nrisk exposures that\narise from these\nmarket-making\nactivities\n(collectively,\ninventory). Our\ninventory is recorded\nin trading assets\n(long positions) or\ntrading liabilities\n(short positions) in\nour consolidated\nbalance sheets. Our\nresults are influenced\nby a combination of\ninterconnected\ndrivers, including (i)\nclient activity levels\nand transactional\nbid/offer spreads\n(collectively, client\nactivity), and (ii)\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of our inventory\nand interest income\nand interest expense\nrelated to the\nholding, hedging and\nfunding of our\ninventory\n(collectively, market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges). Due to the\nintegrated nature of\nour market-making\nactivities,\ndisaggregation of net\nrevenues into client\nactivity and market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges is judgmental\nand has inherent\ncomplexities and\nlimitations. The\namount and composition\nof our net revenues\nvary over time as\nthese drivers are\nimpacted by multiple\ninterrelated factors\naffecting economic and\nmarket conditions,\nincluding volatility\nand liquidity in the\nmarket, changes in\ninterest rates,\ncurrency exchange\nrates, credit spreads,\nequity prices and\ncommodity prices,\ninvestor confidence,\nand other\nmacroeconomic concerns\nand uncertainties. In\ngeneral, assuming all\nother market-making\nconditions remain\nconstant, increases in\nclient activity levels\nor bid/offer spreads\ntend to result in\nincreases in net\nrevenues, and\ndecreases tend to have\nthe opposite effect.\nHowever, changes in\nmarket-making\nconditions can\nmaterially impact\nclient activity levels\nand bid/offer spreads,\nas well as the fair\nvalue of our\ninventory. For\nexample, a decrease in\nliquidity in the\nmarket could have the\nimpact of (i)\nincreasing our\nbid/offer spread, (ii)\ndecreasing investor\nconfidence and thereby\ndecreasing client\nactivity levels, and\n(iii) widening of\ncredit spreads on our\ninventory positions.\nOther. We lend to\ncorporate clients,\nincluding through\nrelationship lending\nand acquisition\nfinancing. The hedges\nrelated to this\nlending and financing\nactivity are also\nreported as part of\nOther.

In\nequities, the S&P 500\nIndex decreased by 19%\nand the MSCI World\nIndex decreased by\n20%, compared with the\nend of 2021.\nAdditionally, global\ncentral banks sought\nto address inflation\nby increasing policy\ninterest rates several\ntimes over the course\nof the year.\n\nIn the future, if\nmarket and economic\nconditions deteriorate\nfurther, and activity\nlevels or volatility\ndecline, or credit\nspreads related to\nhedges on our\nrelationship lending\nportfolio tighten, net\nrevenues in Global\nBanking & Markets\nwould likely be\nnegatively impacted.\nIn addition, if\neconomic conditions\ndeteriorate further or\nif the\ncreditworthiness of\nborrowers\ndeteriorates,\nprovision for credit\nlosses would likely be\nnegatively impacted.\n\n2022 versus 2021. Net\nrevenues in Global\nBanking & Markets were\n$32.49 billion for\n2022, 12% lower than a\nstrong 2021.\n\nInvestment banking\nfees were $7.36\nbillion, 48% lower\nthan a strong 2021,\ndue to significantly\nlower net revenues in\nboth Equity and Debt\nunderwriting,\nreflecting a\nsignificant decline in\nindustry-wide volumes,\nand lower net revenues\nin Advisory,\nreflecting a decline\nin industry-wide\ncompleted mergers and\nacquisitions\ntransactions from\nelevated activity\nlevels in the prior\nyear.\n\nAs of December 2022,\nour Investment banking\nfees backlog decreased\nsignificantly compared\nwith the end of 2021,\nprimarily due to\nsignificantly lower\nestimated net revenues\nfrom both potential\nadvisory transactions\nand potential debt\nunderwriting\ntransactions\n(primarily from\nleveraged finance\ntransactions).\n\nOur backlog represents\nan estimate of our net\nrevenues from future\ntransactions where we\nbelieve that future\nrevenue realization is\nmore likely than not.\nWe believe changes in\nour backlog may be a\nuseful indicator of\nclient activity levels\nwhich, over the long\nterm, impact our net\nrevenues. However, the\ntime frame for\ncompletion and\ncorresponding revenue\nrecognition of\ntransactions in our\nbacklog varies based\non the nature of the\nassignment, as certain\ntransactions may\nremain in our backlog\nfor longer periods of\ntime.

\nOperating Environment. During 2022, Asset &\nWealth Management operated in an environment\ngenerally characterized by broad macroeconomic\nand geopolitical concerns and market\nvolatility, which contributed to a decrease in\nasset prices compared to the end of 2021,\nnegatively affecting assets under supervision\nand investments. Additionally, global central\nbanks sought to address inflation by\nincreasing policy interest rates several times\nover the course of the year. In the future, if\nmarket and economic conditions deteriorate\nfurther, it may lead to a continued decline in\nasset prices, or investors transitioning to\nasset classes that typically generate lower\nfees or withdrawing their assets or deposits,\nand net revenues in Asset & Wealth Management\nwould likely continue to be negatively\nimpacted. 2022 versus 2021. Net revenues in\nAsset & Wealth Management were $13.38 billion\nfor 2022, 39% lower than 2021, primarily\nreflecting significantly lower net revenues in\nEquity investments and Debt investments.\n\nBroad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns\nduring the year led to a decline in global\nequity prices and wider credit spreads. As a\nresult, net revenues in Equity investments\nreflected significantly lower net gains from\ninvestments in private equities and\nsignificant mark-to-market net losses from\ninvestments in public equities. The decrease\nin Debt investments net revenues reflected net\nmark-downs compared with net mark-ups in the\nprior year and lower net interest income.\nIncentive fees were significantly lower,\nprimarily driven by harvesting in the prior\nyear. Management and other fees were higher,\nreflecting the inclusion of NNIP and a\nreduction in fee waivers on money market\nfunds. Private banking and lending net\nrevenues were significantly higher, primarily\nreflecting higher deposit spreads, as well as\nhigher loan and deposit balances. Provision\nfor credit losses was $519 million for 2022,\ncompared with a net benefit of $169 million\nfor 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily\nreflected the impact of macroeconomic and\ngeopolitical concerns, while the net benefit\nfor 2021 reflected reserve reductions as the\nbroad economic environment continued to\nimprove following the initial impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Operating expenses were\n$11.55 billion for 2022, essentially unchanged\ncompared with 2021, reflecting the inclusion\nof operating expenses related to NNIP, largely\noffset by lower compensation and benefits\nexpenses. Pre-tax earnings were $1.31 billion\nfor 2022, compared with $10.73 billion for\n2021. 2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Asset\n& Wealth Management were $21.97 billion for\n2021, 60% higher than 2020, primarily\nreflecting significantly higher net revenues\nin Equity investments and Debt investments,\nand higher Management and other fees. The\nincrease in Equity investments net revenues\nreflected significantly higher net gains from\ninvestments in private equities, driven by\ncompany-specific events and improved corporate\nperformance compared with 2020, partially\noffset by net losses from investments in\npublic equities compared with significant net\ngains in the prior year. The increase in Debt\ninvestments net revenues reflected net mark-\nups compared with net mark-downs in the prior\nyear, and significantly higher net interest\nincome. The increase in management and other\nfees reflected the impact of higher average\nassets under supervision, partially offset by\nhigher fee waivers on money market funds.\nPrivate banking and lending net revenues were\nhigher, primarily reflecting higher deposit\nbalances. Incentive fees were significantly\nhigher, primarily driven by harvesting.\nProvision for credit losses was a net benefit\nof $169 million for 2021, compared with net\nprovisions of $1.40 billion for 2020,\nprimarily due to reserve reductions in the\nyear reflecting continued improvement in the\nbroad economic environment following\nchallenging conditions in 2020 resulting from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n                                      \n  74    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During 2022, Platform\nSolutions operated in an environment generally\ncharacterized by broad macroeconomic concerns.\nIn the U.S., the rate of unemployment remained\nlow and consumer spending increased slightly\ncompared with 2021. Additionally, global\ncentral banks sought to address inflation by\nincreasing policy interest rates several times\nover the course of the year. In the future, if\nmarket and economic conditions deteriorate\nfurther, it may lead to a decrease in consumer\nspending or a deterioration in consumer\ncredit, and net revenues and provision for\ncredit losses in Platform Solutions would\nlikely be negatively impacted.\n\n2022 versus 2021. Net revenues in Platform\nSolutions were $1.50 billion for 2022, 135%\nhigher than 2021, reflecting significantly\nhigher net revenues in both Consumer platforms\nand Transaction banking and other. The\nincrease in Consumer platforms net revenues\nprimarily reflected significantly higher\ncredit card balances. The increase in\nTransaction banking and other net revenues\nreflected higher deposit balances. Provision\nfor credit losses was $1.73 billion for 2022,\ncompared with $697 million for 2021.\nProvisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth\nin the credit card portfolio and net charge\noffs, while 2021 primarily reflected growth in\nthe credit card portfolio, which was partially\noffset by reserve reductions as the broad\neconomic environment continued to improve\nfollowing the initial impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. Operating expenses were $1.76\nbillion for 2022, 78% higher than 2021,\nreflecting higher spend on growth initiatives\nin Consumer platforms, primarily from the\ninclusion of operating expenses related to\nGreenSky. Pre-tax loss was $1.99 billion for\n2022, compared with $1.05 billion for 2021.\n2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Platform\nSolutions were $640 million for 2021, 92%\nhigher than 2020, reflecting significantly\nhigher net revenues in Consumer platforms and\nhigher net revenues in Transaction banking and\nother. Net revenues in Consumer platforms\nreflected higher credit card balances. Net\nrevenues in Transaction banking and other\nreflected higher deposit balances. Provision\nfor credit losses was $697 million for 2021,\n43% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting\ngrowth in the credit card portfolio, including\napproximately $185 million of the provisions\nrelated to the commitment to acquire the\nGeneral Motors co-branded credit card\nportfolio, partially offset by reserve\nreductions in the year reflecting continued\nimprovement in the broad economic environment\nfollowing challenging conditions in 2020\nresulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating expenses were $990 million for 2021,\n57% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting\nhigher spend on growth initiatives in Consumer\nplatforms. Pre-tax loss was $1.05 billion for\n2021, compared with $783 million for 2020.\nGeographic Data See Note 25 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for a\nsummary of our total net revenues, pre-tax\nearnings and net earnings by geographic\nregion.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    79  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Compliance\nwith limits is\nmonitored by our\nrevenue-producing\nunits and Treasury, as\nwell as our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions.\n\nMonitoring of Key\nMetrics. We monitor\nkey balance sheet\nmetrics both by\nbusiness and on a\nconsolidated basis,\nincluding asset and\nliability size and\ncomposition, limit\nutilization and risk\nmeasures. We attribute\nassets to businesses\nand review and analyze\nmovements resulting\nfrom new business\nactivity, as well as\nmarket fluctuations.\n\nScenario Analyses.

We believe that our\nrelationships with our creditors are critical\nto our liquidity. Our creditors include banks,\ngovernments, securities lenders, corporations,\npension funds, insurance companies, mutual\nfunds and individuals. We have imposed various\ninternal guidelines to monitor creditor\nconcentration across our funding programs.\nDeposits. Our deposits provide us with a\ndiversified source of funding and reduce our\nreliance on wholesale funding. We raise\ndeposits, including savings, demand and time\ndeposits, from private bank clients,\nconsumers, transaction banking clients, other\ninstitutional clients, and through internal\nand third-party broker-dealers. Substantially\nall of our deposits are raised through GS Bank\nUSA, GSIB and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE\n(GSBE). See Note 13 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements for further information\nabout our deposits, including a maturity\nprofile of our time deposits.\n\nSecured Funding. We fund a significant amount\nof inventory and a portion of investments on a\nsecured basis. Secured funding includes\ncollateralized financings in the consolidated\nbalance sheets. See Note 11 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about our collateralized\nfinancings, including its maturity profile. We\nmay also pledge our inventory and investments\nas collateral for securities borrowed under a\nsecurities lending agreement. We also use our\nown inventory and investments to cover\ntransactions in which we or our clients have\nsold securities that have not yet been\npurchased. Secured funding is less sensitive\nto changes in our credit quality than\nunsecured funding, due to our posting of\ncollateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we\nanalyze the refinancing risk of our secured\nfunding activities, taking into account trade\ntenors, maturity profiles, counterparty\nconcentrations, collateral eligibility and\ncounterparty rollover probabilities. We seek\nto mitigate our refinancing risk by executing\nterm trades with staggered maturities,\ndiversifying counterparties, raising excess\nsecured funding and pre-funding residual risk\nthrough our GCLA. We seek to raise secured\nfunding with a term appropriate for the\nliquidity of the assets that are being\nfinanced, and we seek longer maturities for\nsecured funding collateralized by asset\nclasses that may be harder to fund on a\nsecured basis, especially during times of\nmarket stress. Our secured funding, excluding\nfunding collateralized by liquid government\nand agency obligations, is primarily executed\nfor tenors of one month or greater and is\nprimarily executed through term repurchase\nagreements and securities loaned contracts.\nAssets that may be harder to fund on a secured\nbasis during times of market stress include\ncertain financial instruments in the following\ncategories: mortgage- and other asset-backed\nloans and securities, non-investment-grade\ncorporate debt securities, equity securities\nand emerging market securities. We also raise\nfinancing through other types of\ncollateralized financings, such as secured\nloans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to\nfunding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. We\nhad no outstanding borrowings from the Federal\nHome Loan Bank as of December 2022 and $100\nmillion as of December 2021. Additionally, we\nhave access to funding through the Federal\nReserve discount window. However, we do not\nrely on this funding in our liquidity planning\nand stress testing.\n                                      \n  82    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

To mitigate\nrefinancing risk, we seek to limit the\nprincipal amount of debt maturing over the\ncourse of any monthly, quarterly, semi-annual\nor annual time horizon. We enter into interest\nrate swaps to convert a portion of our\nunsecured long-term borrowings into floating-\nrate obligations to manage our exposure to\ninterest rates. See Note 14 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about our unsecured long-term\nborrowings. We issued approximately $28\nbillion of benchmark debt during 2022, and we\nintend to issue significantly less benchmark\ndebt in 2023 compared to our benchmark debt\nissuance in 2022, though actual issuances may\ndiffer due to business needs and market\nopportunities. Shareholders\u2019 Equity.\nShareholders\u2019 equity is a stable and perpetual\nsource of funding. See Note 19 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about our shareholders\u2019 equity.\n\nCapital Management and Regulatory Capital\nCapital adequacy is of critical importance to\nus. We have in place a comprehensive capital\nmanagement policy that provides a framework,\ndefines objectives and establishes guidelines\nto assist us in maintaining the appropriate\nlevel and composition of capital in both\nbusiness-as-usual and stressed conditions.\nCapital Management We determine the\nappropriate amount and composition of our\ncapital by considering multiple factors,\nincluding our current and future regulatory\ncapital requirements, the results of our\ncapital planning and stress testing process,\nthe results of resolution capital models and\nother factors, such as rating agency\nguidelines, subsidiary capital requirements,\nthe business environment and conditions in the\nfinancial markets. We manage our capital\nrequirements and the levels of our capital\nusage principally by setting limits on the\nbalance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each\ncase at both the firmwide and business levels.\nWe principally manage the level and\ncomposition of our capital through issuances\nand repurchases of our common stock. We may\nissue, redeem or repurchase our preferred\nstock and subordinated debt or other forms of\ncapital as business conditions warrant. Prior\nto such redemptions or repurchases, we must\nreceive approval from the FRB. See Notes 14\nand 19 to the consolidated financial\nstatements for further information about our\npreferred stock and subordinated debt. Capital\nPlanning and Stress Testing Process. As part\nof capital planning, we project sources and\nuses of capital given a range of business\nenvironments, including stressed conditions.\nOur stress testing process is designed to\nidentify and measure material risks associated\nwith our business activities, including market\nrisk, credit risk, operational risk and\nliquidity risk, as well as our ability to\ngenerate revenues. Our capital planning\nprocess incorporates an internal capital\nadequacy assessment with the objective of\nensuring that we are appropriately capitalized\nrelative to the risks in our businesses. We\nincorporate stress scenarios into our capital\nplanning process with a goal of holding\nsufficient capital to ensure we remain\nadequately capitalized after experiencing a\nsevere stress event. Our assessment of capital\nadequacy is viewed in tandem with our\nassessment of liquidity adequacy and is\nintegrated into our overall risk management\nstructure, governance and policy framework.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    83  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\npurpose of the FRB\u2019s\nreview is to ensure\nthat we have a robust,\nforward-looking\ncapital planning\nprocess that accounts\nfor our unique risks\nand that permits\ncontinued operation\nduring times of\neconomic and financial\nstress.\n\nThe FRB evaluates us\nbased, in part, on\nwhether we have the\ncapital necessary to\ncontinue operating\nunder the baseline and\nseverely adverse\nscenarios provided by\nthe FRB and those\ndeveloped internally.\nThis evaluation also\ntakes into account our\nprocess for\nidentifying risk, our\ncontrols and\ngovernance for capital\nplanning, and our\nguidelines for making\ncapital planning\ndecisions. In\naddition, the FRB\nevaluates our plan to\nmake capital\ndistributions (i.e.,\ndividend payments and\nrepurchases or\nredemptions of stock,\nsubordinated debt or\nother capital\nsecurities) and issue\ncapital, across the\nrange of macroeconomic\nscenarios and firm-\nspecific assumptions.\nThe FRB determines the\nstress capital buffer\n(SCB) applicable to us\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\nThe SCB under the\nStandardized approach\nis calculated as (i)\nthe difference between\nour starting and\nminimum projected CET1\ncapital ratios under\nthe supervisory\nseverely adverse\nscenario and (ii) our\nplanned common stock\ndividends for each of\nthe fourth through\nseventh quarters of\nthe planning horizon,\nexpressed as a\npercentage of risk-\nweighted assets\n(RWAs).\n\nBased on our 2022 CCAR\nsubmission, the FRB\nreduced our SCB from\n6.4% to 6.3% for the\nperiod from October 1,\n2022 through September\n30, 2023. As a result,\nbeginning on October\n1, 2022, our\nStandardized CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement was 13.3%.\nAdditionally,\neffective January 1,\n2023, our G-SIB\nsurcharge increased\nfrom 2.5% to 3.0%,\nresulting in a\nStandardized CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement of 13.8%.\nSee \u201cShare Repurchase\nProgram\u201d for further\ninformation about\ncommon stock\nrepurchases and\ndividends and\n\u201cConsolidated\nRegulatory Capital\u201d\nfor further\ninformation about the\nG-SIB surcharge.

As part of our\ncomprehensive capital\nmanagement policy, we\nmaintain a contingency\ncapital plan. Our\ncontingency capital\nplan provides a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nperceived or actual\ncapital deficiency,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to,\nidentification of\ndrivers of a capital\ndeficiency, as well as\nmitigants and\npotential actions. It\noutlines the\nappropriate\ncommunication\nprocedures to follow\nduring a crisis\nperiod, including\ninternal dissemination\nof information, as\nwell as timely\ncommunication with\nexternal stakeholders.\n\nCapital Attribution.\nWe assess the capital\nusage of each of our\nbusinesses based on\nour attributed equity\nframework. This\nframework considers\nmany factors,\nincluding our internal\nassessment of risks as\nwell as the regulatory\ncapital requirements\nrelated to our\nbusiness activities.\nThese regulatory\ncapital requirements\ntake into\nconsideration our most\nbinding capital\nconstraints. Our most\nbinding capital\nconstraint is our CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement under the\nStandardized Capital\nRules. This\nrequirement includes\nthe SCB which is\ndetermined by the FRB\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\n\nShare Repurchase\nProgram. We use our\nshare repurchase\nprogram to help\nmaintain the\nappropriate level of\ncommon equity. The\nrepurchase program is\neffected primarily\nthrough regular open-\nmarket purchases\n(which may include\nrepurchase plans\ndesigned to comply\nwith Rule 10b5-1 and\naccelerated share\nrepurchases), the\namounts and timing of\nwhich are determined\nprimarily by our\ncurrent and projected\ncapital position and\nour capital plan\nsubmitted to the FRB\nas part of CCAR. The\namounts and timing of\nthe repurchases may\nalso be influenced by\ngeneral market\nconditions and the\nprevailing price and\ntrading volumes of our\ncommon stock.\n\nIn the third quarter\nof 2022, the Board of\nDirectors of Group\nInc. (Board) approved\nan increase in our\ncommon stock dividend\nfrom $2.00 to $2.50\nper share. During\n2022, we returned a\ntotal of $6.70 billion\nto shareholders,\nincluding common stock\nrepurchases of $3.50\nbillion and common\nstock dividends of\n$3.20 billion. During\nthe fourth quarter of\n2022, we returned a\ntotal of $2.38 billion\nto shareholders,\nincluding common stock\nrepurchases of $1.50\nbillion and common\nstock dividends of\n$880 million.\nConsistent with our\ncapital management\nphilosophy, we will\ncontinue prioritizing\ndeployment of capital\nfor our clients where\nreturns are attractive\nand return any excess\ncapital to\nshareholders through\ndividends and share\nrepurchases. During\nthe first quarter of\n2023 through February\n23, 2023, our common\nstock repurchases were\napproximately $2.25\nbillion.\n                                      \n  84    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In\naccordance with the TLAC rules, the higher of\nAdvanced or Standardized RWAs are used in the\ncalculation of TLAC and external long-term\ndebt ratios and applicable requirements.\n\n\u2022 Leverage exposure consists of average\nadjusted total assets and certain off-balance\nsheet exposures. In the second half of 2022,\nbased on regulatory feedback, we revised\ncertain interpretations of the Capital Rules\nunderlying the calculation of Standardized\nRWAs. As of December 2021, this change would\nhave reduced our TLAC to RWAs ratio of 44.0%\nby 0.8 percentage points and our External\nlong-term debt to RWAs ratio of 25.8% by 0.5\npercentage points.

These profits\ncontributed approximately 9 basis points to\nthe CET1 capital ratio as of December 2022.\n\nGSI is also subject to the minimum leverage\nratio requirement of 3.25% established by the\nPRA, which became effective in January 2023.\nGSI had a leverage ratio of 6.1% as of\nDecember 2022. The leverage ratio as of\nDecember 2022 reflected profits after\nforeseeable charges that are still subject to\naudit by GSI\u2019s external auditors and approval\nby GSI's Board of Directors for inclusion in\nrisk-based capital. These profits contributed\napproximately 7 basis points to the leverage\nratio as of December 2022. GSI is a registered\nswap dealer with the CFTC and a registered\nsecurity-based swap dealer with the SEC. As of\nboth December 2022 and December 2021, GSI was\nsubject to and in compliance with applicable\ncapital requirements for swap dealers and\nsecurity-based swap dealers. GSI is also\nsubject to a minimum requirement for own funds\nand eligible liabilities issued to affiliates.\nThis requirement is subject to a transitional\nperiod which began to phase in from January\n2019 and became fully effective beginning in\nJanuary 2022. As of both December 2022 and\nDecember 2021, GSI was in compliance with this\nrequirement. GSJCL, our Japanese broker-\ndealer, is regulated by Japan\u2019s Financial\nServices Agency. GSJCL and certain other\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to\ncapital requirements promulgated by\nauthorities of the countries in which they\noperate. As of both December 2022 and December\n2021, these subsidiaries were in compliance\nwith their local capital requirements.\nRegulatory and Other Matters Regulatory\nMatters Our businesses are subject to\nextensive regulation and supervision\nworldwide. Regulations have been adopted or\nare being considered by regulators and policy\nmakers worldwide. Given that many of the new\nand proposed rules are highly complex, the\nfull impact of regulatory reform will not be\nknown until the rules are implemented and\nmarket practices develop under the final\nregulations.

On\nJanuary 1, 2022, the\npublication of all\nEUR, CHF, JPY and GBP\nLIBOR (non-USD LIBOR)\nsettings along with\ncertain USD LIBOR\nsettings ceased. The\npublication of the\nmost commonly used USD\nLIBOR settings as\nrepresentative rates\nwill cease after June\n2023. The FCA has\nallowed the\npublication and use of\nsynthetic rates for\ncertain GBP LIBOR\nsettings in legacy GBP\nLIBOR-based derivative\ncontracts through\nMarch 2024. The FCA\nhas proposed to allow\nthe publication and\nuse of synthetic rates\nfor certain USD LIBOR\nsettings in legacy USD\nLIBOR-based derivative\ncontracts through\nSeptember 2024. The\nU.S. federal banking\nagencies\u2019 guidance\nstrongly encourages\nbanking organizations\nto cease using USD\nLIBOR.\n\nThe International\nSwaps and Derivatives\nAsso ciation (ISDA)\n2020 IBOR Fallbacks\nProtocol (IBOR\nProtocol) has provided\nderivatives market\nparticipants with\namended fallbacks for\nlegacy and new\nderivative contracts\nto mitigate legal or\neconomic uncertainty.\nBoth counterparties\nhave to adhere to the\nIBOR Protocol or\nengage in bilateral\namendments for the\nterms to be effective\nfor derivative\ncontracts. ISDA has\nconfirmed that the\nFCA\u2019s formal\nannouncement to cease\nboth non-USD and USD\nLIBOR settings fixed\nthe spread adjustment\nfor all LIBOR rates\nand as a result\nfallbacks applied\nautomatically for non-\nUSD LIBOR settings\nfollowing December 31,\n2021 and will apply\nautomatically for USD\nLIBOR settings\nfollowing June 30,\n2023. The Adjustable\nInterest Rate (LIBOR)\nAct, that was enacted\nin March 2022,\nprovides a statutory\nframework to replace\nUSD LIBOR with a\nbenchmark rate based\non the Secured\nOvernight Financing\nRate (SOFR) for\ncontracts governed by\nU.S. law that have no\nfallbacks or fallbacks\nthat would require the\nuse of a poll or\nLIBOR-based rate. In\nDecember 2022, the FRB\nadopted a final rule\nthat implements the\nLIBOR Act, which will\nbecome effective on\nFebruary 27, 2023. The\nfinal rule identifies\ndifferent SOFR-based\nreplacement rates for\nderivative contracts,\nfor cash instruments\nsuch as floating-rate\nnotes and preferred\nstock, for consumer\ncontracts, for certain\ngovernment-sponsored\nenterprise contracts\nand for certain\nstudent loan\nsecuritizations that\nlack a fallback to an\nalternative rate when\nUSD LIBOR ceases to be\npublished on June 30,\n2023.\n\nWe facilitated an\norderly transition\nfrom non-USD LIBORs to\nalternative risk-free\nreference rates and\nsynthetic rates for us\nand our clients, and\ncontinue to make\nprogress on our\ntransition program as\nit relates to USD\nLIBOR.\n\nOur risk exposure to\nUSD LIBOR is primarily\nin connection with our\nderivative contracts\nand, to a lesser\nextent, our unsecured\ndebt, preferred stock\nand loan portfolio. As\nof December 2022, the\nnotional amount of our\nUSD LIBOR-based\nderivative contracts\nwas approximately $6\ntrillion, of which\napproximately $5\ntrillion will mature\nafter June 2023 based\non their contractual\nterms. Substantially\nall of such derivative\ncontracts are with\ncounterparties under\nbilateral agreements\nsubject to the IBOR\nProtocol, or with\ncentral clearing\ncounterparties or\nexchanges which have\nincorporated fallbacks\nconsistent with the\nIBOR Protocol in their\nrulebooks and have\nannounced that they\nplan to convert USD\nLIBOR contracts to\nalternative risk-free\nreference rates. Our\nunsecured benchmark\ndebt and preferred\nstock with USD LIBOR\nexposure was\napproximately $29.0\nbillion as of December\n2022, of which $26.4\nbillion will\ncontractually mature\nafter June 2023 or is\nperpetual and has no\nstated maturity date.\nUnder the FRB\u2019s final\nrule and the LIBOR\nAct, we will replace\nour USD LIBOR-based\nunsecured benchmark\ndebt and preferred\nstock with term SOFR\nplus the statutorily\nprescribed tenor\nspread. This\ntransition will take\nplace following USD\nLIBOR cessation on\nJune 30, 2023. In\naddition, our USD\nLIBOR-based loans were\napproximately $33.1\nbillion as of December\n2022, of which\napproximately $30.5\nbillion will mature\nafter June 2023 based\non their contractual\nterms. A vast majority\nof such loans contain\nfallback provisions in\nthe related loan\nagreements and we are\nactively engaging with\nour clients and\nsyndicate partners to\nremediate the\nremaining loans\nagreements.\n\nWe have also issued de\nbt and deposits linked\nto SOFR and Sterling\nOvernight Index\nAverage (SONIA) and\nexecuted SOFR- and\nSONIA-based derivative\ncontracts to make\nmarkets and facilitate\nclient activities.\nWhen appropriate, we\ncontinue to execute\ntransactions in the\nmarket to reduce our\nUSD LIBOR exposures\narising from hedges to\nour fixed-rate debt\nissuances and replace\nthem with alternative\nrisk-free reference\nrate exposures.\n                                      \n  88    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Our\ninvolvement in these\narrangements can take\nmany different forms,\nincluding: \u2022\nPurchasing or\nretaining residual and\nother interests in\nspecial purpose\nentities, such as\nmortgage-backed and\nother asset-backed\nsecuritization\nvehicles; \u2022 Holding\nsenior and\nsubordinated debt,\ninterests in limited\nand general\npartnerships, and\npreferred and common\nstock in other\nnonconsolidated\nvehicles; \u2022 Entering\ninto interest rate,\nforeign currency,\nequity, commodity and\ncredit derivatives,\nincluding total return\nswaps; and \u2022 Providing\nguarantees,\nindemnifications,\ncommitments, letters\nof credit and\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. We enter\ninto these\narrangements for a\nvariety of business\npurposes, including\nsecuritizations. The\nsecuritization\nvehicles that purchase\nmortgages, corporate\nbonds and other types\nof financial assets\nare critical to the\nfunctioning of several\nsignificant investor\nmarkets, including the\nmortgage-backed and\nother asset-backed\nsecurities markets,\nsince they offer\ninvestors access to\nspecific cash flows\nand risks created\nthrough the\nsecuritization\nprocess. We also enter\ninto these\narrangements to\nunderwrite client\nsecuritization\ntransactions; provide\nsecondary market\nliquidity; make\ninvestments in\nperforming and\nnonperforming debt,\ndistressed loans,\npower-related assets,\nequity securities,\nreal estate and other\nassets; and provide\ninvestors with credit-\nlinked and asset-\nrepackaged notes.\n\nThe table below\npresents where\ninformation about our\nvarious off-balance\nsheet arrangements may\nbe found in this Form\n10-K.

Risk\nmanagement governance\nstarts with the Board,\nwhich both directly\nand through its\ncommittees, including\nits Risk Committee,\noversees our risk\nmanagement policies\nand practices\nimplemented through\nthe enterprise risk\nmanagement framework.\nThe Board is also\nresponsible for the\nannual review and\napproval of our risk\nappetite statement.\nThe risk appetite\nstatement describes\nthe levels and types\nof risk we are willing\nto accept or to avoid,\nin order to achieve\nour objectives\nincluded in our\nstrategic business\nplan, while remaining\nin compliance with\nregulatory\nrequirements. The\nBoard reviews our\nstrategic business\nplan and is ultimately\nresponsible for\noverseeing and\nproviding direction\nabout our strategy and\nrisk appetite.\n\nThe Board receives\nregular briefings on\nfirmwide risks,\nincluding liquidity\nrisk, market risk,\ncredit risk,\noperational risk,\nmodel risk and climate\nrisk, from our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions, including\nthe chief risk\nofficer, and on\ncompliance risk and\nconduct risk from\nCompliance, on legal\nand regulatory\nenforcement matters\nfrom the chief legal\nofficer, and on other\nmatters impacting our\nreputation from the\nchair and vice-chairs\nof our Firmwide\nReputational Risk\nCommittee. The chief\nrisk officer reports\nto our chief executive\nofficer and to the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard. As part of the\nreview of the firmwide\nrisk portfolio, the\nchief risk officer\nregularly advises the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard of relevant risk\nmetrics and material\nexposures, including\nrisk limits and\nthresholds established\nin our risk appetite\nstatement.\n\nThe implementation of\nour risk governance\nstructure and core\nrisk management\nprocesses is overseen\nby Enterprise Risk,\nwhich reports to our\nchief risk officer,\nand is responsible for\nensuring that our\nenterprise risk\nmanagement framework\nprovides the Board,\nour risk committees\nand senior management\nwith a consistent and\nintegrated approach to\nmanaging our various\nrisks in a manner\nconsistent with our\nrisk appetite.\n\nOur revenue-producing\nunits, as well as\nTreasury, Engineering,\nHuman Capital\nManagement,\nOperations, and\nCorporate and\nWorkplace Solutions,\nare considered our\nfirst line of defense.\nThey are accountable\nfor the outcomes of\nour risk-generating\nactivities, as well as\nfor assessing and\nmanaging those risks\nwithin our risk\nappetite.\n\nOur independent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions are\nconsidered our second\nline of defense and\nprovide independent\nassessment, oversight\nand challenge of the\nrisks taken by our\nfirst line of defense,\nas well as lead and\nparticipate in risk\ncommittees.\nIndependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions include\nCompliance, Conflicts\nResolution,\nControllers, Legal,\nRisk and Tax.\n\nInternal Audit is\nconsidered our third\nline of defense, and\nour director of\nInternal Audit reports\nto the Audit Committee\nof the Board and\nadministratively to\nour chief executive\nofficer. Internal\nAudit includes\nprofessionals with a\nbroad range of audit\nand industry\nexperience, including\nrisk management\nexpertise. Internal\nAudit is responsible\nfor independently\nassessing and\nvalidating the\neffectiveness of key\ncontrols, including\nthose within the risk\nmanagement framework,\nand providing timely\nreporting to the Audit\nCommittee of the\nBoard, senior\nmanagement and\nregulators.\n                                      \n  90    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nThe three lines of\ndefense structure\npromotes the\naccountability of\nfirst line risk\ntakers, provides a\nframework for\neffective challenge by\nthe second line and\nempowers independent\nreview from the third\nline.\n\nProcesses. We maintain\nvarious processes that\nare critical\ncomponents of our risk\nmanagement framework,\nincluding (i) risk\nidentification and\ncontrol assessment,\n(ii) risk appetite,\nlimit and threshold\nsetting, (iii) risk\nmetrics, reporting and\nmonitoring, and (iv)\nrisk decision-making.\n\n\u2022 Risk Identification\nand Control\nAssessment. We believe\nthe identification of\nour risks and related\ncontrol assessment is\na critical step in\nproviding our Board\nand senior management\ntransparency and\ninsight into the range\nand materiality of our\nrisks. We have a\ncomprehensive data\ncollection process,\nincluding firmwide\npolicies and\nprocedures that\nrequire all employees\nto report and escalate\nrisk events. Our\napproach for risk\nidentification and\ncontrol assessment is\ncomprehensive across\nall risk types, is\ndynamic and forward-\nlooking to reflect and\nadapt to our changing\nrisk profile and\nbusiness environment,\nleverages subject\nmatter expertise, and\nallows for\nprioritization of our\nmost critical risks.\nThis approach also\nencompasses our\ncontrol assessment,\nled by our second line\nof defense, to review\nand challenge the\ncontrol environment to\nensure it supports our\nstrategic business\nplan.\n\nTo effectively assess\nour risks, we maintain\na daily discipline of\nmarking substantially\nall of our inventory\nto current market\nlevels. We carry our\ninventory at fair\nvalue, with changes in\nvaluation reflected\nimmediately in our\nrisk management\nsystems and in net\nrevenues. We do so\nbecause we believe\nthis discipline is one\nof the most effective\ntools for assessing\nand managing risk and\nthat it provides\ntransparent and\nrealistic insight into\nour inventory\nexposures.\n\nAn important part of\nour risk management\nprocess is firmwide\nstress testing. It\nallows us to quantify\nour exposure to tail\nrisks, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations,\nundertake risk/reward\nanalysis, and assess\nand mitigate our risk\npositions. Firmwide\nstress tests are\nperformed on a regular\nbasis and are designed\nto ensure a\ncomprehensive analysis\nof our vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic\nrisks combining\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, credit,\nmarket, liquidity and\nfunding, operational\nand compliance,\nstrategic, systemic\nand emerging risks\ninto a single combined\nscenario. We also\nperform ad hoc stress\ntests in anticipation\nof market events or\nconditions. Stress\ntests are also used to\nassess capital\nadequacy as part of\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess. See \u201cCapital\nManagement and\nRegulatory Capital \u2014\nCapital Management\u201d\nfor further\ninformation.\n\n\u2022 Risk Appetite, Limit\nand Threshold Setting.\nWe apply a rigorous\nframework of limits\nand thresholds to\ncontrol and monitor\nrisk across\ntransactions,\nproducts, businesses\nand markets. The\nBoard, directly or\nindirectly through its\nRisk Committee,\napproves limits and\nthresholds included in\nour risk appetite\nstatement at firmwide,\nbusiness and product\nlevels. In addition,\nthe Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee,\nthrough delegated\nauthority from the\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee, is\nresponsible for\napproving our risk\nlimits and thresholds\npolicy, subject to the\noverall limits\napproved by the Risk\nCommittee of the\nBoard, and monitoring\nthese limits.\n\nThe Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee is\nresponsible for\napproving limits at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels.\nCertain limits may be\nset at levels that\nwill require periodic\nadjustment, rather\nthan at levels that\nreflect our maximum\nrisk appetite. This\nfosters an ongoing\ndialogue about risk\namong our first and\nsecond lines of\ndefense, committees\nand senior management,\nas well as rapid\nescalation of risk-\nrelated matters.\nAdditionally, through\ndelegated authority\nfrom the Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee,\nMarket Risk sets\nlimits at certain\nproduct and desk\nlevels, and Credit\nRisk sets limits for\nindividual\ncounterparties and\ntheir subsidiaries,\nindustries and\ncountries. Limits are\nreviewed regularly and\namended on a permanent\nor temporary basis to\nreflect changing\nmarket conditions,\nbusiness conditions or\nrisk tolerance.\n\n\u2022 Risk Metrics,\nReporting and\nMonitoring. Effective\nrisk reporting and\nrisk decision-making\ndepends on our ability\nto get the right\ninformation to the\nright people at the\nright time. As such,\nwe focus on the rigor\nand effectiveness of\nour risk systems, with\nthe objective of\nensuring that our risk\nmanagement technology\nsystems provide us\nwith complete,\naccurate and timely\ninformation. Our risk\nmetrics, reporting and\nmonitoring processes\nare designed to take\ninto account\ninformation about both\nexisting and emerging\nrisks, thereby\nenabling our risk\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement to perform\ntheir responsibilities\nwith the appropriate\nlevel of insight into\nrisk exposures.\nFurthermore, our limit\nand threshold breach\nprocesses provide\nmeans for timely\nescalation. We\nevaluate changes in\nour risk profile and\nour businesses,\nincluding changes in\nbusiness mix or\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate, by\nmonitoring risk\nfactors at a firmwide\nlevel.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    91  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \n\u2022 Risk Decision-\nMaking. Our governance\nstructure provides the\nprotocol and\nresponsibility for\ndecision-making on\nrisk management issues\nand ensures\nimplementation of\nthose decisions. We\nmake extensive use of\nrisk committees that\nmeet regularly and\nserve as an important\nmeans to facilitate\nand foster ongoing\ndiscussions to manage\nand mitigate risks.\n\nWe maintain strong and\nproactive\ncommunication about\nrisk and we have a\nculture of\ncollaboration in\ndecision-making among\nour first and second\nlines of defense,\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement. While our\nfirst line of defense\nis responsible for\nmanagement of their\nrisk, we dedicate\nextensive resources to\nour second line of\ndefense in order to\nensure a strong\noversight structure\nand an appropriate\nsegregation of duties.\nWe regularly reinforce\nour strong culture of\nescalation and\naccountability across\nall functions.\n\nPeople. Even the best\ntechnology serves only\nas a tool for helping\nto make informed\ndecisions in real time\nabout the risks we are\ntaking. Ultimately,\neffective risk\nmanagement requires\nour people to\ninterpret our risk\ndata on an ongoing and\ntimely basis and\nadjust risk positions\naccordingly. The\nexperience of our\nprofessionals, and\ntheir understanding of\nthe nuances and\nlimitations of each\nrisk measure, guides\nus in assessing\nexposures and\nmaintaining them\nwithin prudent levels.\n\nWe reinforce a culture\nof effective risk\nmanagement, consistent\nwith our risk\nappetite, in our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nas well as in the way\nwe evaluate\nperformance, and\nrecognize and reward\nour people. Our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nincluding certain\nsessions led by our\nmost senior leaders,\nare focused on the\nimportance of risk\nmanagement, client\nrelationships and\nreputational\nexcellence. As part of\nour performance review\nprocess, we assess\nreputational\nexcellence, including\nhow an employee\nexercises good risk\nmanagement and\nreputational judgment,\nand adheres to our\ncode of conduct and\ncompliance policies.\nOur review and reward\nprocesses are designed\nto communicate and\nreinforce to our\nprofessionals the link\nbetween behavior and\nhow people are\nrecognized, the need\nto focus on our\nclients and our\nreputation, and the\nneed to always act in\naccordance with our\nhighest standards.\n                                              \n  Structure                                   \n                                              \nUltimate oversight of\nrisk is the\nresponsibility of our\nBoard. The Board\noversees risk both\ndirectly and through\nits committees,\nincluding its Risk\nCommittee. We also\nhave a series of\ncommittees with\nspecific risk\nmanagement mandates\nthat have oversight or\ndecision-making\nresponsibilities for\nrisk management\nactivities. Committee\nmembership generally\nconsists of senior\nmanagers from both our\nfirst and second lines\nof defense. We have\nestablished procedures\nfor these committees\nto ensure that\nappropriate\ninformation barriers\nare in place. Our\nprimary risk\ncommittees, most of\nwhich also have\nadditional sub-\ncommittees, councils\nor working groups, are\ndescribed below. In\naddition to these\ncommittees, we have\nother risk committees\nthat provide oversight\nfor different\nbusinesses,\nactivities, products,\nregions and entities.\nAll of our committees\nhave responsibility\nfor considering the\nimpact on our\nreputation of the\ntransactions and\nactivities that they\noversee.\n\nMembership of our risk\ncommittees is reviewed\nregularly and updated\nto reflect changes in\nthe responsibilities\nof the committee\nmembers. Accordingly,\nthe length of time\nthat members serve on\nthe respective\ncommittees varies as\ndetermined by the\ncommittee chairs and\nbased on the\nresponsibilities of\nthe members.\n\nThe chart below\npresents an overview\nof our risk management\ngovernance structure.\n                                      \n  92    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

GCLA is\nliquidity that we\nmaintain to meet a\nbroad range of\npotential cash\noutflows and\ncollateral needs in a\nstressed environment.\nA primary liquidity\nprinciple is to pre-\nfund our estimated\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs\nduring a liquidity\ncrisis and hold this\nliquidity in the form\nof unencumbered,\nhighly liquid\nsecurities and cash.\nWe believe that the\nsecurities held in our\nGCLA would be readily\nconvertible to cash in\na matter of days,\nthrough liquidation,\nby entering into\nrepurchase agreements\nor from maturities of\nresale agreements, and\nthat this cash would\nallow us to meet\nimmediate obligations\nwithout needing to\nsell other assets or\ndepend on additional\nfunding from credit-\nsensitive markets.\n\nOur GCLA reflects the\nfollowing principles:\n\n\u2022 The first days or\nweeks of a liquidity\ncrisis are the most\ncritical to a\ncompany\u2019s survival;\n\n\u2022 Focus must be\nmaintained on all\npotential cash and\ncollateral outflows,\nnot just disruptions\nto financing flows.\nOur businesses are\ndiverse, and our\nliquidity needs are\ndetermined by many\nfactors, including\nmarket movements,\ncollateral\nrequirements and\nclient commitments,\nall of which can\nchange dramatically in\na difficult funding\nenvironment;\n\n\u2022 During a liquidity\ncrisis, credit-\nsensitive funding,\nincluding unsecured\ndebt, certain deposits\nand some types of\nsecured financing\nagreements, may be\nunavailable, and the\nterms (e.g., interest\nrates, collateral\nprovisions and tenor)\nor availability of\nother types of secured\nfinancing may change\nand certain deposits\nmay be withdrawn; and\n\n\u2022 As a result of our\npolicy to pre-fund\nliquidity that we\nestimate may be needed\nin a crisis, we hold\nmore unencumbered\nsecurities and have\nlarger funding\nbalances than our\nbusinesses would\notherwise require. We\nbelieve that our\nliquidity is stronger\nwith greater balances\nof highly liquid\nunencumbered\nsecurities, even\nthough it increases\nour total assets and\nour funding costs.\n\nWe maintain our GCLA\nacross Group Inc.,\nGoldman Sachs Funding\nLLC (Funding IHC) and\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries, asset\ntypes and clearing\nagents to provide us\nwith sufficient\noperating liquidity to\nensure timely\nsettlement in all\nmajor markets, even in\na difficult funding\nenvironment. In\naddition to the GCLA,\nwe maintain cash\nbalances and\nsecurities in several\nof our other entities,\nprimarily for use in\nspecific currencies,\nentities or\njurisdictions where we\ndo not have immediate\naccess to parent\ncompany liquidity.\n\nAsset-Liability\nManagement. Our\nliquidity risk\nmanagement policies\nare designed to ensure\nwe have a sufficient\namount of financing,\neven when funding\nmarkets experience\npersistent stress. We\nmanage the maturities\nand diversity of our\nfunding across\nmarkets, products and\ncounterparties, and\nseek to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nOur approach to asset-\nliability management\nincludes:\n\n\u2022 Conservatively\nmanaging the overall\ncharacteristics of our\nfunding book, with a\nfocus on maintaining\nlong-term, diversified\nsources of funding in\nexcess of our current\nrequirements. See\n\u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nFunding Sources\u201d for\nfurther information;\n\n\u2022 Actively managing\nand monitoring our\nasset base, with\nparticular focus on\nthe liquidity, holding\nperiod and ability to\nfund assets on a\nsecured basis. We\nassess our funding\nrequirements and our\nability to liquidate\nassets in a stressed\nenvironment while\nappropriately managing\nrisk. This enables us\nto determine the most\nappropriate funding\nproducts and tenors.\nSee \u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nBalance Sheet\nManagement\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our balance\nsheet management\nprocess and \u201c\u2014 Funding\nSources \u2014 Secured\nFunding\u201d for further\ninformation about\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis; and\n\n\u2022 Raising secured and\nunsecured financing\nthat has a long tenor\nrelative to the\nliquidity profile of\nour assets. This\nreduces the risk that\nour liabilities will\ncome due in advance of\nour ability to\ngenerate liquidity\nfrom the sale of our\nassets. Because we\nmaintain a highly\nliquid balance sheet,\nthe holding period of\ncertain of our assets\nmay be materially\nshorter than their\ncontractual maturity\ndates.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    95  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nOur goal is to ensure\nthat we maintain\nsufficient liquidity\nto fund our assets and\nmeet our contractual\nand contingent\nobligations in normal\ntimes, as well as\nduring periods of\nmarket stress. Through\nour dynamic balance\nsheet management\nprocess, we use actual\nand projected asset\nbalances to determine\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding requirements.\nFunding plans are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee.\nIn addition, our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions analyze, and\nthe Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee\nreviews, our\nconsolidated total\ncapital position\n(unsecured long-term\nborrowings plus total\nshareholders\u2019 equity)\nso that we maintain a\nlevel of long-term\nfunding that is\nsufficient to meet our\nlong-term financing\nrequirements. In a\nliquidity crisis, we\nwould first use our\nGCLA in order to avoid\nreliance on asset\nsales (other than our\nGCLA). However, we\nrecognize that orderly\nasset sales may be\nprudent or necessary\nin a severe or\npersistent liquidity\ncrisis.\nSubsidiary Funding\nPolicies\nThe majority of our\nunsecured funding is\nraised by Group Inc.,\nwhich provides the\nnecessary funds to\nFunding IHC and other\nsubsidiaries, some of\nwhich are regulated,\nto meet their asset\nfinancing, liquidity\nand capital\nrequirements. In\naddition, Group Inc.\nprovides its regulated\nsubsidiaries with the\nnecessary capital to\nmeet their regulatory\nrequirements. The\nbenefits of this\napproach to subsidiary\nfunding are enhanced\ncontrol and greater\nflexibility to meet\nthe funding\nrequirements of our\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nis also raised at the\nsubsidiary level\nthrough a variety of\nproducts, including\ndeposits, secured\nfunding and unsecured\nborrowings.\n\nOur intercompany\nfunding policies\nassume that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s funds or\nsecurities are not\nfreely available to\nits parent, Funding\nIHC or other\nsubsidiaries unless\n(i) legally provided\nfor and (ii) there are\nno additional\nregulatory, tax or\nother restrictions. In\nparticular, many of\nour subsidiaries are\nsubject to laws that\nauthorize regulatory\nbodies to block or\nreduce the flow of\nfunds from those\nsubsidiaries to Group\nInc. or Funding IHC.\nRegulatory action of\nthat kind could impede\naccess to funds that\nGroup Inc. needs to\nmake payments on its\nobligations.\nAccordingly, we assume\nthat the capital\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or other\nsubsidiaries and any\nother financing\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or Funding\nIHC until the maturity\nof such financing.\n\nGroup Inc. has\nprovided substantial\namounts of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness, directly\nor indirectly, to its\nregulated\nsubsidiaries. For\nexample, as of\nDecember 2022, Group\nInc. had $39.33\nbillion of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness invested\nin GS&Co., its\nprincipal U.S.\nregistered broker-\ndealer; $47.74 billion\ninvested in GSI, a\nregulated U.K. broker-\ndealer; $2.62 billion\ninvested in GSJCL, a\nregulated Japanese\nbroker-dealer; $52.55\nbillion invested in GS\nBank USA, a regulated\nNew York State-\nchartered bank; and\n$4.25 billion invested\nin GSIB, a regulated\nU.K. bank. Group Inc.\nalso provides\nfinancing, directly or\nindirectly, in the\nform of: $108.14\nbillion of\nunsubordinated loans\n(including secured\nloans of $52.93\nbillion) and $30.16\nbillion of collateral\nand cash deposits to\nthese entities as of\nDecember 2022. In\naddition, as of\nDecember 2022, Group\nInc. had significant\namounts of capital\ninvested in and loans\nto its other regulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nContingency Funding\nPlan. We maintain a\ncontingency funding\nplan to provide a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nliquidity crisis\nsituation or periods\nof market stress. Our\ncontingency funding\nplan outlines a list\nof potential risk\nfactors, key reports\nand metrics that are\nreviewed on an ongoing\nbasis to assist in\nassessing the severity\nof, and managing\nthrough, a liquidity\ncrisis and/or market\ndislocation. The\ncontingency funding\nplan also describes in\ndetail our potential\nresponses if our\nassessments indicate\nthat we have entered a\nliquidity crisis,\nwhich include pre-\nfunding for what we\nestimate will be our\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs, as\nwell as utilizing\nsecondary sources of\nliquidity. Mitigants\nand action items to\naddress specific risks\nwhich may arise are\nalso described and\nassigned to\nindividuals\nresponsible for\nexecution.\n\nThe contingency\nfunding plan\nidentifies key groups\nof individuals and\ntheir\nresponsibilities,\nwhich include\nfostering effective\ncoordination, control\nand distribution of\ninformation,\nimplementing liquidity\nmaintenance activities\nand managing internal\nand external\ncommunication, all of\nwhich are critical in\nthe management of a\ncrisis or period of\nmarket stress.\n                                      \n  96    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

One of our\nprimary internal\nliquidity risk models,\nreferred to as the\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow, quantifies\nour liquidity risks\nover a 30-day stress\nscenario. We also\nconsider other\nfactors, including,\nbut not limited to, an\nassessment of our\npotential intraday\nliquidity needs\nthrough an additional\ninternal liquidity\nrisk model, referred\nto as the Intraday\nLiquidity Model, the\nresults of our long-\nterm stress testing\nmodels, our resolution\nliquidity models and\nother applicable\nregulatory\nrequirements and a\nqualitative assessment\nof our condition, as\nwell as the financial\nmarkets. The results\nof the Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow, the\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel, the long-term\nstress testing models\nand the resolution\nliquidity models are\nreported to senior\nmanagement on a\nregular basis. We also\nperform firmwide\nstress tests. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\n\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow. Our Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow is\nbased on conducting\nmultiple scenarios\nthat include\ncombinations of\nmarket-wide and firm-\nspecific stress. These\nscenarios are\ncharacterized by the\nfollowing qualitative\nelements:\n\n\u2022 Severely challenged\nmarket environments,\nwhich include low\nconsumer and corporate\nconfidence, financial\nand political\ninstability, and\nadverse changes in\nmarket values,\nincluding potential\ndeclines in equity\nmarkets and widening\nof credit spreads; and\n\n\u2022 A firm-specific\ncrisis potentially\ntriggered by material\nlosses, reputational\ndamage, litigation\nand/or a ratings\ndowngrade.\n\nThe following are key\nmodeling elements of\nour Modeled Liquidity\nOutflow:\n\n\u2022 Liquidity needs over\na 30-day scenario;\n\n\u2022 A two-notch\ndowngrade of our long-\nterm senior unsecured\ncredit ratings;\n\n\u2022 Changing conditions\nin funding markets,\nwhich limit our access\nto unsecured and\nsecured funding;\n\n\u2022 No support from\nadditional government\nfunding facilities.\nAlthough we have\naccess to various\ncentral bank funding\nprograms, we do not\nassume reliance on\nadditional sources of\nfunding in a liquidity\ncrisis; and\n\n\u2022 A combination of\ncontractual outflows\nand contingent\noutflows arising from\nboth our on- and off-\nbalance sheet\narrangements.\nContractual outflows\ninclude, among other\nthings, upcoming\nmaturities of\nunsecured debt, term\ndeposits and secured\nfunding. Contingent\noutflows include,\namong other things,\nthe withdrawal of\ncustomer credit\nbalances in our prime\nbrokerage business,\nincrease in variation\nmargin requirements\ndue to adverse changes\nin the value of our\nexchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared\nderivatives, draws on\nunfunded commitments\nand withdrawals of\ndeposits that have no\ncontractual maturity.\nSee notes to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\ncontractual outflows,\nincluding Note 11 for\ncollateralized\nfinancings, Note 13\nfor deposits, Note 14\nfor unsecured long-\nterm borrowings and\nNote 15 for operating\nlease payments, and\n\u201cOff-Balance Sheet\nArrangements\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our various\ntypes of off-balance\nsheet arrangements.\n\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel. Our Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nmeasures our intraday\nliquidity needs using\na scenario analysis\ncharacterized by the\nsame qualitative\nelements as our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow. The model\nassesses the risk of\nincreased intraday\nliquidity requirements\nduring a scenario\nwhere access to\nsources of intraday\nliquidity may become\nconstrained.\n\nLong-Term Stress\nTesting. We utilize\nlonger-term stress\ntests to take a\nforward view on our\nliquidity position\nthrough prolonged\nstress periods in\nwhich we experience a\nsevere liquidity\nstress and recover in\nan environment that\ncontinues to be\nchallenging. We are\nfocused on ensuring\nconservative asset-\nliability management\nto prepare for a\nprolonged period of\npotential stress,\nseeking to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nResolution Liquidity\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established our\nResolution Liquidity\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich estimates\nliquidity needs of our\nmajor subsidiaries in\na stressed\nenvironment. The\nliquidity needs are\nmeasured using our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow assumptions\nand include certain\nadditional inter-\naffiliate exposures.\nWe have also\nestablished our\nResolution Liquidity\nExecution Need\nframework, which\nmeasures the liquidity\nneeds of our major\nsubsidiaries to\nstabilize and wind\ndown following a Group\nInc. bankruptcy filing\nin accordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIn addition, we have\nestablished a triggers\nand alerts framework,\nwhich is designed to\nprovide the Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    97  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Liquidity\nRegulatory Framework\nAs a BHC, we are\nsubject to a minimum\nLiquidity Coverage\nRatio (LCR) under the\nLCR rule approved by\nthe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies.\nThe LCR rule requires\norganizations to\nmaintain an adequate\nratio of eligible\nhigh-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) to\nexpected net cash\noutflows under an\nacute, short-term\nliquidity stress\nscenario. Eligible\nHQLA excludes HQLA\nheld by subsidiaries\nthat is in excess of\ntheir minimum\nrequirement and is\nsubject to transfer\nrestrictions. We are\nrequired to maintain a\nminimum LCR of 100%.\nWe expect that\nfluctuations in client\nactivity, business mix\nand the market\nenvironment will\nimpact our LCR.

We\nmonitor local\nregulatory liquidity\nrequirements of our\nsubsidiaries to ensure\ncompliance. For many\nof our subsidiaries,\nthese requirements\neither have changed or\nare likely to change\nin the future due to\nthe implementation of\nthe Basel Committee\u2019s\nframework for\nliquidity risk\nmeasurement, standards\nand monitoring, as\nwell as other\nregulatory\ndevelopments. The\nimplementation of\nthese rules and any\namendments adopted by\nthe regulatory\nauthorities could\nimpact our liquidity\nand funding\nrequirements and\npractices in the\nfuture.\n\nCredit Ratings We rely\non the short- and\nlong-term debt capital\nmarkets to fund a\nsignificant portion of\nour day-to-day\noperations and the\ncost and availability\nof debt financing is\ninfluenced by our\ncredit ratings.

Certain of our derivatives have\nbeen transacted under bilateral agreements\nwith counterparties who may require us to post\ncollateral or terminate the transactions based\non changes in our credit ratings. We manage\nour GCLA to ensure we would, among other\npotential requirements, be able to make the\nadditional collateral or termination payments\nthat may be required in the event of a two-\nnotch reduction in our long-term credit\nratings, as well as collateral that has not\nbeen called by counterparties, but is\navailable to them. See Note 7 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about derivatives with credit-\nrelated contingent features and the additional\ncollateral or termination payments related to\nour net derivative liabilities under bilateral\nagreements that could have been called by\ncounterparties in the event of a one- or two-\nnotch downgrade in our credit ratings.\n\nCash Flows As a global financial institution,\nour cash flows are complex and bear little\nrelation to our net earnings and net assets.\nConsequently, we believe that traditional cash\nflow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating\nour liquidity position than the liquidity and\nasset-liability management policies described\nabove. Cash flow analysis may, however, be\nhelpful in highlighting certain macro trends\nand strategic initiatives in our businesses.\nYear Ended December 2022. Our cash and cash\nequivalents decreased by $19.21 billion to\n$241.83 billion at the end of 2022, primarily\ndue to net cash used for investing activities,\npartially offset by net cash provided by\nfinancing activities. The net cash used for\ninvesting activities primarily reflected\npurchases of investments (primarily U.S.\ngovernment obligations accounted for as held-\nto-maturity) and an increase in net lending\nactivities (reflecting increases in other\ncollateralized and consumer loans). The net\ncash provided by financing activities\nprimarily reflected cash inflows from net\nissuances of unsecured long-term borrowings\nand deposits (reflecting increases in\ntransaction banking and private bank and\nconsumer deposits, partially offset by a\ndecrease in other deposits). The net cash\nprovided by operating activities primarily\nreflected cash inflows from trading assets and\nliabilities, customer and other receivables\nand payables, net (reflecting both a decrease\nin customer and other receivables and an\nincrease in customer and other payables), net\nearnings and loans held for sale, net,\npartially offset by cash outflows from\ncollateralized transactions (reflecting both a\ndecrease in collateralized financings and an\nincrease in collateralized agreements). The\ndecrease in cash and cash equivalents as a\nresult of changes in foreign exchange rates\nwas due to the U.S. dollar strengthening\nduring the year. Such amount was $11.56\nbillion for 2022 ($3.42 billion for the three\nmonths ended March 2022, $10.34 billion for\nthe six months ended June 2022 and $18.17\nbillion for the nine months ended September\n2022). Year Ended December 2021 . Our cash and\ncash equivalents increased by $105.19 billion\nto $261.04 billion at the end of 2021,\nprimarily due to net cash provided by\nfinancing activities, partially offset by net\ncash used for investing activities. The net\ncash provided by financing activities\nprimarily reflected an increase in net\ndeposits (reflecting increases across\nchannels) and net issuances of unsecured long-\nterm borrowings. The net cash used for\ninvesting activities primarily reflected\npurchases of investments and an increase in\nnet lending activities, partially offset by\nsales and paydowns of investments.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nWe are aware of the\ninherent limitations\nto VaR and therefore\nuse a variety of risk\nmeasures in our market\nrisk management\nprocess. Inherent\nlimitations to VaR\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 VaR does not\nestimate potential\nlosses over longer\ntime horizons where\nmoves may be extreme;\n\n\u2022 VaR does not take\naccount of the\nrelative liquidity of\ndifferent risk\npositions; and\n\n\u2022 Previous moves in\nmarket risk factors\nmay not produce\naccurate predictions\nof all future market\nmoves.\n\nTo comprehensively\ncapture our exposures\nand relevant risks in\nour VaR calculation,\nwe use historical\nsimulations with full\nvaluation of market\nfactors at the\nposition level by\nsimultaneously\nshocking the relevant\nmarket factors for\nthat position. These\nmarket factors include\nspot prices, credit\nspreads, funding\nspreads, yield curves,\nvolatility and\ncorrelation, and are\nupdated periodically\nbased on changes in\nthe composition of\npositions, as well as\nvariations in market\nconditions. We sample\nfrom five years of\nhistorical data to\ngenerate the scenarios\nfor our VaR\ncalculation. The\nhistorical data is\nweighted so that the\nrelative importance of\nthe data reduces over\ntime. This gives\ngreater importance to\nmore recent\nobservations and\nreflects current asset\nvolatilities, which\nimproves the accuracy\nof our estimates of\npotential loss. As a\nresult, even if our\npositions included in\nVaR were unchanged,\nour VaR would increase\nwith increasing market\nvolatility and vice\nversa.\n\nGiven its reliance on\nhistorical data, VaR\nis most effective in\nestimating risk\nexposures in markets\nin which there are no\nsudden fundamental\nchanges or shifts in\nmarket conditions.\n\nOur VaR measure does\nnot include:\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nnot accounted for at\nfair value, such as\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities and loans,\ndeposits and unsecured\nborrowings that are\naccounted for at\namortized cost;\n\n\u2022 Available-for-sale\nsecurities for which\nthe related unrealized\nfair value gains and\nlosses are included in\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss);\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nbest measured and\nmonitored using\nsensitivity measures;\nand\n\n\u2022 The impact of\nchanges in\ncounterparty and our\nown credit spreads on\nderivatives, as well\nas changes in our own\ncredit spreads on\nfinancial liabilities\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected.\n\nWe perform daily\nbacktesting of our VaR\nmodel (i.e., comparing\ndaily net revenues for\npositions included in\nVaR to the VaR measure\ncalculated as of the\nprior business day) at\nthe firmwide level and\nfor each of our\nbusinesses and major\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nEarnings-at-Risk.\nBeginning in the\nfourth quarter of\n2022, we started\nmanaging our interest\nrate risk using the\nEaR metric. EaR\nmeasures the estimated\nimpact of changes in\ninterest rates to our\nnet revenues and\npreferred stock\ndividends over a\ndefined time horizon.\nEaR complements the\nVaR metric, which\nmeasures the impact of\ninterest rate changes\nthat have an immediate\nimpact on the fair\nvalues of our assets\nand liabilities (i.e.,\nmark-to-market\nchanges). Our exposure\nto interest rate risk\noccurs due to a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to:\n\n\u2022 Differences in\nmaturity or repricing\ndates of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock and certain off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments.\n\n\u2022 Differences in the\namounts of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock and certain off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments with the\nsame maturity or\nrepricing dates.\n\n\u2022 Certain interest\nrate sensitive fees.\n\nTreasury manages the\naggregated interest\nrate risk from all\nbusinesses through our\ninvestment securities\nportfolio and interest\nrate derivatives. We\nmeasure EaR over a\none-year time horizon\nfollowing a 100-basis\npoint instantaneous\nparallel shock in both\nshort- and long-term\ninterest rates. This\nsensitivity is\ncalculated relative to\na baseline market\nscenario, which takes\ninto consideration,\namong other things,\nthe market\u2019s\nexpectation of forward\nrates, as well as our\nexpectation of future\nbusiness activity.\nThis scenario includes\ncontractual elements\nof assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock, and certain\noff-balance sheet\ninstruments, such as\nrates of interest,\nprincipal repayment\nschedules, maturity\nand reset dates, and\nany interest rate\nceilings or floors, as\nwell as assumptions\nwith respect to our\nbalance sheet size and\ncomposition, deposit\nrepricing and\nprepayment behavior.\nWe manage EaR with a\ngoal to reduce\npotential volatility\nresulting from changes\nin interest rates so\nit remains within our\nEaR risk appetite. Our\nEaR scenario is\nregularly evaluated\nand updated, if\nnecessary, to reflect\nchanges in our\nbusiness plans, market\nconditions and other\nmacroeconomic factors.\nWhile management uses\nthe best information\navailable to estimate\nEaR, actual results\nmay differ materially\nas a result of, among\nother things, changes\nin the economic\nenvironment or\nassumptions used in\nthe process.\n\nRisk, which is\nindependent of our\nrevenue-producing\nunits, and Treasury,\nhave primary\nresponsibility for\nassessing and\nmonitoring EaR through\nfirmwide oversight,\nincluding oversight of\nEaR stress testing and\nassumptions, and the\nestablishment of our\nEaR risk appetite.\n                                       \n  102    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Stress\ntesting is a method of\ndetermining the effect\nof various\nhypothetical stress\nscenarios. In addition\nto EaR, we use other\nstress tests to\nexamine risks of\nspecific portfolios,\nas well as the\npotential impact of\nour significant risk\nexposures. We use a\nvariety of stress\ntesting techniques to\ncalculate the\npotential loss from a\nwide range of market\nmoves on our\nportfolios, including\nfirmwide stress tests,\nsensitivity analysis\nand scenario analysis.\nThe results of our\nvarious stress tests\nare analyzed together\nfor risk management\npurposes. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\nSensitivity analysis\nis used to quantify\nthe impact of a market\nmove in a single risk\nfactor across all\npositions (e.g.,\nequity prices or\ncredit spreads) using\na variety of defined\nmarket shocks, ranging\nfrom those that could\nbe expected over a\none-day time horizon\nup to those that could\ntake many months to\noccur. We also use\nsensitivity analysis\nto quantify the impact\nof the default of any\nsingle entity, which\ncaptures the risk of\nlarge or concentrated\nexposures. Scenario\nanalysis is used to\nquantify the impact of\na specified event,\nincluding how the\nevent impacts multiple\nrisk factors\nsimultaneously. For\nexample, for sovereign\nstress testing we\ncalculate potential\ndirect exposure\nassociated with our\nsovereign positions,\nas well as the\ncorresponding debt,\nequity and currency\nexposures associated\nwith our non-sovereign\npositions that may be\nimpacted by the\nsovereign distress.\nWhen conducting\nscenario analysis, we\noften consider a\nnumber of possible\noutcomes for each\nscenario, ranging from\nmoderate to severely\nadverse market\nimpacts. In addition,\nthese stress tests are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical events and\nforward-looking\nhypothetical\nscenarios. Unlike VaR\nmeasures, which have\nan implied probability\nbecause they are\ncalculated at a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, there may not\nbe an implied\nprobability that our\nstress testing\nscenarios will occur.\nInstead, stress\ntesting is used to\nmodel both moderate\nand more extreme moves\nin underlying market\nfactors. When\nestimating potential\nloss, we generally\nassume that our\npositions cannot be\nreduced or hedged\n(although experience\ndemonstrates that we\nare generally able to\ndo so). Limits We use\nmarket risk limits at\nvarious levels to\nmanage the size of our\nmarket exposures.\nThese limits are set\nbased on VaR, EaR and\non a range of stress\ntests relevant to our\nexposures. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess. Limits are\nmonitored by Treasury\nand Risk. Risk is\nresponsible for\nidentifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded (e.g., due to\npositional changes or\nchanges in market\nconditions, such as\nincreased volatilities\nor changes in\ncorrelations). Such\ninstances are\nremediated by a\nreduction in the\npositions we hold\nand/or a temporary or\npermanent increase to\nthe limit, if\nwarranted.\n\nMetrics We analyze VaR\nat the firmwide level\nand a variety of more\ndetailed levels,\nincluding by risk\ncategory, business and\nregion.\nDiversification effect\nin the tables below\nrepresents the\ndifference between\ntotal VaR and the sum\nof the VaRs for the\nfour risk categories.\nThis effect arises\nbecause the four\nmarket risk categories\nare not perfectly\ncorrelated.

For\nsubstantially all of\nour credit exposures,\nthe core of our\nprocess is an annual\ncounterparty credit\nevaluation or more\nfrequently if deemed\nnecessary as a result\nof events or changes\nin circumstances. We\ndetermine an internal\ncredit rating for the\ncounterparty by\nconsidering the\nresults of the credit\nevaluations and\nassumptions with\nrespect to the nature\nof and outlook for the\ncounterparty\u2019s\nindustry and the\neconomic environment.\nThe internal credit\nrating does not take\ninto consideration\ncollateral received or\nother credit support\narrangements. Senior\npersonnel, with\nexpertise in specific\nindustries, inspect\nand approve credit\nreviews and internal\ncredit ratings.\n\nOur risk assessment\nprocess may also\ninclude, where\napplicable, reviewing\ncertain key metrics,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to,\ndelinquency status,\ncollateral value, FICO\ncredit scores and\nother risk factors.\n\nOur credit risk\nmanagement systems\ncapture credit\nexposure to individual\ncounterparties and on\nan aggregate basis to\ncounterparties and\ntheir subsidiaries.\nThese systems also\nprovide management\nwith comprehensive\ninformation about our\naggregate credit risk\nby product, internal\ncredit rating,\nindustry, country and\nregion.\n                                              \n  Risk Measures                               \n                                              \nWe measure our credit\nrisk based on the\npotential loss in the\nevent of non-payment\nby a counterparty\nusing current and\npotential exposure.\nFor derivatives and\nsecurities financing\ntransactions, current\nexposure represents\nthe amount presently\nowed to us after\ntaking into account\napplicable netting and\ncollateral\narrangements, while\npotential exposure\nrepresents our\nestimate of the future\nexposure that could\narise over the life of\na transaction based on\nmarket movements\nwithin a specified\nconfidence level.\nPotential exposure\nalso takes into\naccount netting and\ncollateral\narrangements.

In\naddition, we also have\ncredit exposure to\nother loans held for\nsecuritization of\n$1.76 billion as of\nDecember 2022 and $467\nmillion as of December\n2021. Such loans are\nincluded in trading\nassets in our\nconsolidated balance\nsheets. Credit Hedges.\nTo mitigate the credit\nrisk associated with\nour lending\nactivities, we obtain\ncredit protection on\ncertain loans and\nlending commitments\nthrough credit default\nswaps, both single-\nname and index-based\ncontracts, and through\nthe issuance of\ncredit-linked notes.\n\nSecurities Financing\nTransactions. We enter\ninto securities\nfinancing transactions\nin order to, among\nother things,\nfacilitate client\nactivities, invest\nexcess cash, acquire\nsecurities to cover\nshort positions and\nfinance certain\nactivities. We bear\ncredit risk related to\nresale agreements and\nsecurities borrowed\nonly to the extent\nthat cash advanced or\nthe value of\nsecurities pledged or\ndelivered to the\ncounterparty exceeds\nthe value of the\ncollateral received.\nWe also have credit\nexposure on repurchase\nagreements and\nsecurities loaned to\nthe extent that the\nvalue of securities\npledged or delivered\nto the counterparty\nfor these transactions\nexceeds the amount of\ncash or collateral\nreceived. Securities\ncollateral for these\ntransactions primarily\nincludes U.S. and\nnon-U.S. government\nand agency\nobligations.

These\nreceivables generally\nhave minimal credit\nrisk due to the low\nprobability of\nclearing organization\ndefault and the short-\nterm nature of\nreceivables related to\nsecurities\nsettlements.\nReceivables from\ncustomers and\ncounterparties\ngenerally consist of\ncollateralized\nreceivables related to\ncustomer securities\ntransactions and\ngenerally have minimal\ncredit risk due to\nboth the value of the\ncollateral received\nand the short-term\nnature of these\nreceivables.

Credit exposure represents\nthe potential for loss due to the default or\ndeterioration in credit quality of a\ncounterparty or borrower. Market exposure\nrepresents the potential for loss in value of\nour long and short positions due to changes in\nmarket prices.\n\nCountry Exposures. The Russian invasion of\nUkraine continues to negatively affect the\nglobal economy and has resulted in significant\ndisruptions in financial markets and increased\nmacroeconomic uncertainty. Governments around\nthe world have responded to Russia\u2019s invasion\nby imposing economic sanctions and export\ncontrols on specific industry sectors,\ncompanies and individuals in Russia.\nRetaliatory restrictions against investors,\nnon-Russian owned businesses and other\nsovereign states have been implemented by\nRussia. Businesses in the U.S. and globally\ncontinue to experience shortages in materials\nand increased costs for transportation, energy\nand raw materials due, in part, to the\nnegative effects of the war on the global\neconomy. The escalation or continuation of the\nwar between Russia and Ukraine presents\nheightened risks relating to cyber attacks,\nlimited ability to settle securities\ntransactions, third-party and agent bank\ndependencies, supply chain disruptions, and\ninflation, as well as the potential for\nincreased volatility in commodity, currency\nand other financial markets. Complying with\neconomic sanctions and restrictions imposed by\ngovernments has resulted in increased\noperational risk. The extent and duration of\nthe war, sanctions and resulting market\ndisruptions, as well as the potential adverse\nconsequences for our business, liquidity and\nresults of operations, are difficult to\npredict. Our senior management, risk\ncommittees and the Board receive regular\nbriefings from our independent risk oversight\nand control functions, including our chief\nrisk officer, on Russian and Ukrainian\nexposures, as well as other relevant risk\nmetrics. We have significantly reduced our\nexposure to Russia and Ukraine and have\ncurtailed our operations in Russia to those\nnecessary to meet our legal and regulatory\nobligations. The overall direct financial\nimpact to our net revenues for 2022 from\nRussian and Ukrainian counterparties,\nborrowers, issuers and related instruments was\nnot material. We have established a firmwide\nworking group to identify and assess the\noperational risk associated with complying\nwith economic sanctions and restrictions as a\nresult of this invasion. In addition, to\nmitigate the risk of increased cyber attacks,\nwe liaise with government agencies in order to\nupdate our monitoring processes with the\nlatest information. Our total credit exposure\nto Russian or Ukrainian counterparties or\nborrowers and our total market exposure\nrelating to Russian or Ukrainian issuers was\nnot material as of December 2022. In addition,\neconomic and/or political uncertainties in\nArgentina, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lebanon, Pakistan,\nSri Lanka and Venezuela have led to concerns\nabout their financial stability. Our credit\nexposure to counterparties or borrowers and\nour market exposure to issuers relating to\neach of these countries was not material as of\nDecember 2022.\n                                       \n  114    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a\nvoting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)\nthe total equity investment at risk is\nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity\nholders have the power to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the\nentity and the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting\ninterest entity is ownership of a majority\nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest\nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable\nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that\nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a\nvoting interest entity. The firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when\nthe firm has a variable interest or interests\nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive\nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for\nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method\nInvestments. When the firm does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity\nbut can exert significant influence over the\nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair\nvalue by electing the fair value option\navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant\ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns\n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstance common stock. In certain cases, the\nfirm applies the equity method of accounting\nto new investments that are strategic in\nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s\nprincipal business activities, when the firm\nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or\nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less\nsignificant. See Note 8 for further\ninformation about equity-method investments.\n                                       \n  128    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed\ninvestment funds with third-party investors.\nThese funds are typically organized as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies\nfor which the firm acts as general partner or\nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a\nmajority of the economic interests in these\nfunds. These funds are usually voting interest\nentities and generally are not consolidated\nbecause third-party investors typically have\nrights to terminate the funds or to remove the\nfirm as general partner or manager.\nInvestments in these funds are generally\nmeasured at net asset value (NAV) and are\nincluded in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and\n22 for further information about investments\nin funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of\nthese consolidated financial statements\nrequires management to make certain estimates\nand assumptions, the most important of which\nrelate to fair value measurements, the\nallowance for credit losses on loans and\nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, provisions for losses that\nmay arise from litigation and regulatory\nproceedings (including governmental\ninvestigations), and accounting for income\ntaxes. These estimates and assumptions are\nbased on the best available information, but\nactual results could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition Financial Assets and\nLiabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and\nliabilities and certain investments are\ncarried at fair value either under the fair\nvalue option or in accordance with other U.S.\nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to\naccount for certain of its loans and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nby electing the fair value option. The fair\nvalue of a financial instrument is the amount\nthat would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked\nto bid prices and financial liabilities are\nmarked to offer prices. Fair value\nmeasurements do not include transaction costs.\nFair value gains or losses are generally\nincluded in market making or other principal\ntransactions. See Note 4 for further\ninformation about fair value measurements.\nRevenue from Contracts with Clients. The firm\nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with\nclients for services, such as investment\nbanking, investment management, and execution\nand clearing (contracts with clients), when\nthe performance obligations related to the\nunderlying transaction are completed. Revenues\nfrom contracts with clients represent\napproximately 50% of total non-interest\nrevenues for 2022 (including approximately 85%\nof investment banking revenues, approximately\n95% of investment management revenues and all\ncommissions and fees), approximately 45% of\ntotal non-interest revenues for 2021\n(including approximately 90% of both\ninvestment banking revenues and investment\nmanagement revenues, and all commissions and\nfees), and approximately 45% of total non-\ninterest revenues for 2020 (including\napproximately 90% of investment banking\nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment\nmanagement revenues and all commissions and\nfees). See Note 25 for information about net\nrevenues by business segment. Investment\nBanking Advisory. Fees from financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues when\nthe services related to the underlying\ntransaction are completed under the terms of\nthe assignment. Non-refundable deposits and\nmilestone payments in connection with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nin revenues upon completion of the underlying\ntransaction or when the assignment is\notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nwhen incurred and are included in transaction\nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such\nexpenses are included in investment banking\nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon\ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses\nassociated with underwriting assignments are\ngenerally deferred until the related revenue\nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise\nconcluded. Such expenses are included in\ntransaction based expenses for completed\nassignments.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    129  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nInvestment Management The firm earns\nmanagement fees and incentive fees for\ninvestment management services, which are\nincluded in investment management revenues.\nThe firm makes payments to brokers and\nadvisors related to the placement of the\nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),\nwhich are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily net asset value and are received\nmonthly. Management fees for hedge funds and\nseparately managed accounts are calculated as\na percentage of month-end net asset value and\nare generally received quarterly. Management\nfees for private equity funds are calculated\nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are received quarterly,\nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the\nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.\nDistribution fees paid by the firm are\ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net\nasset value or the committed capital. Such\nfees are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are\ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or\nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other\nperformance target. Incentive fees are\ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a\nfund. Fees that are based on performance over\na twelve-month period are subject to\nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment\nperformance over the life of the fund, future\ninvestment underperformance may require fees\npreviously distributed to the firm to be\nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned\nfrom a fund or separately managed account are\nrecognized when it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal of such fees will not\noccur, which is generally when such fees are\nno longer subject to fluctuations in the\nmarket value of investments held by the fund\nor separately managed account. Therefore,\nincentive fees recognized during the period\nmay relate to performance obligations\nsatisfied in previous periods. Commissions and\nFees The firm earns substantially all\ncommissions and fees from executing and\nclearing client transactions on stock, options\nand futures markets, as well as over-the-\ncounter (OTC) transactions. Commissions and\nfees are recognized on the day the trade is\nexecuted. The firm also provides third-party\nresearch services to clients in connection\nwith certain soft-dollar arrangements. Third-\nparty research costs incurred by the firm in\nconnection with such arrangements are\npresented net within commissions and fees.\nRemaining Performance Obligations Remaining\nperformance obligations are services that the\nfirm has committed to perform in the future in\nconnection with its contracts with clients.\nThe firm\u2019s remaining performance obligations\nare generally related to its financial\nadvisory assignments and certain investment\nmanagement activities. Revenues associated\nwith remaining performance obligations\nrelating to financial advisory assignments\ncannot be determined until the outcome of the\ntransaction. For the firm\u2019s investment\nmanagement activities, where fees are\ncalculated based on the net asset value of the\nfund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining\nperformance obligations cannot be determined\nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in\nthe market value of investments held by the\nfund or separately managed account. The firm\nis able to determine the future revenues\nassociated with management fees calculated\nbased on committed capital. As of December\n2022, substantially all future net revenues\nassociated with such remaining performance\nobligations will be recognized through 2030.\nAnnual revenues associated with such\nperformance obligations average less than $\n300million through 2030. Transfers of\nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has\nrelinquished control over the assets\ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses\nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or\nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement with transferred\nfinancial assets are initially recognized at\nfair value. For transfers of financial assets\nthat are not accounted for as sales, the\nassets are generally included in trading\nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a\ncollateralized financing, with the related\ninterest expense recognized over the life of\nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about transfers of financial\nassets accounted for as collateralized\nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted\nfor as sales.\n                                       \n  130    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Cash and cash equivalents included\ncash and due from banks of $ 7.87billion as of\nDecember 2022 and $ 10.14billion as of\nDecember 2021. Cash and cash equivalents also\nincluded interest-bearing deposits with banks\nof $ 233.96billion as of December 2022 and $\n250.90billion as of December 2021. The firm\nsegregates cash for regulatory and other\npurposes related to client activity. Cash and\ncash equivalents segregated for regulatory and\nother purposes were $ 16.94billion as of\nDecember 2022 and $ 24.87billion as of\nDecember 2021. In addition, the firm\nsegregates securities for regulatory and other\npurposes related to client activity. See Note\n11 for further information about segregated\nsecurities. Customer and Other Receivables\nCustomer and other receivables included\nreceivables from customers and counterparties\nof $ 67.88billion as of December 2022 and $\n103.82billion as of December 2021, and\nreceivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations of $ 67.57billion as of December\n2022 and $ 56.85billion as of December 2021.\nSuch receivables primarily consist of\ncollateral posted in connection with certain\nderivative transactions, customer margin loans\nand receivables resulting from unsettled\ntransactions. Substantially all of these\nreceivables are accounted for at amortized\ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,\nwhich generally approximates fair value. As\nthese receivables are not accounted for at\nfair value, they are not included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5.\nHad these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of\nboth December 2022 and December 2021. See Note\n10 for further information about customer and\nother receivables accounted for at fair value\nunder the fair value option. Interest on\ncustomer and other receivables is recognized\nover the life of the transaction and included\nin interest income. Customer and other\nreceivables includes receivables from\ncontracts with clients and contract assets.\nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to\nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s\nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n3.01billion as of both December 2022 and\nDecember 2021. As of both December 2022 and\nDecember 2021, contract assets were not\nmaterial. Customer and Other Payables Customer\nand other payables included payables to\ncustomers and counterparties of $\n238.12billion as of December 2022 and $\n241.93billion as of December 2021, and\npayables to brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations of $ 23.93billion as of December\n2022 and $ 10.00billion as of December 2021.\nSuch payables primarily consist of customer\ncredit balances related to the firm\u2019s prime\nbrokerage activities. Customer and other\npayables are accounted for at cost plus\naccrued interest, which generally approximates\nfair value. As these payables are not\naccounted for at fair value, they are not\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 and 5. Had these payables been\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,\nsubstantially all would have been classified\nin level 2 as of both December 2022 and\nDecember 2021. Interest on customer and other\npayables is recognized over the life of the\ntransaction and included in interest expense.\nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities To reduce\ncredit exposures on derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter\ninto master netting agreements or similar\narrangements (collectively, netting\nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such\ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a\ncontract with a counterparty that permits net\nsettlement of multiple transactions with that\ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of\ntermination rights by a non-defaulting party.\nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all\ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is\ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with\nrespect to its derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms\nof the related credit support agreements or\nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit\nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit\nsupport agreement grants the non-defaulting\nparty exercising termination rights the right\nto liquidate the collateral and apply the\nproceeds to any amounts owed. In order to\nassess enforceability of the firm\u2019s right of\nsetoff under netting and credit support\nagreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in\nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the\nagreement. Derivatives are reported on a net-\nby-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for derivative assets and\nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the\nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting\nagreement. Resale agreements and securities\nsold under agreements to repurchase\n(repurchase agreements) and securities\nborrowed and loaned transactions with the same\nsettlement date are presented on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis in the consolidated balance\nsheets when such transactions meet certain\nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    131  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value Measurements The fair value\nof a financial instrument is the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid\nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not\ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures\ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active\nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by\nreference to prices for similar instruments,\nquoted prices or recent transactions in less\nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or\nindependently sourced inputs, including, but\nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities,\nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding\nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference\nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower\ncould finance a given financial instrument\nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.\nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for\ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This\nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving\nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based\non the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In\nevaluating the significance of a valuation\ninput, the firm considers, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to\nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as\nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical,\nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.\nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are\nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values\nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial\nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain\nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and\nliabilities may require valuation adjustments\nthat a market participant would require to\narrive at fair value for factors, such as\ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments\nare generally based on market evidence.\nThe table below\npresents financial\nassets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value.\n                                              \n  $

Level 1 instruments include\nU.S. government obligations, most non-U.S.\ngovernment obligations, certain agency\nobligations, certain corporate debt\ninstruments, certain money market instruments\nand actively traded listed equities. These\ninstruments are valued using quoted prices for\nidentical unrestricted instruments in active\nmarkets. The firm defines active markets for\nequity instruments based on the average daily\ntrading volume both in absolute terms and\nrelative to the market capitalization for the\ninstrument. The firm defines active markets\nfor debt instruments based on both the average\ndaily trading volume and the number of days\nwith trading activity. Level 2. Level 2\ninstruments include certain non-U.S.\ngovernment obligations, most agency\nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and\nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,\nmost state and municipal obligations, most\nmoney market instruments, most other debt\nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed\nequities, certain private equities,\ncommodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be\nverified to quoted prices, recent trading\nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative\npricing sources with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency. Consideration is given to\nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor executable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Valuation\nadjustments are typically made to level 2\ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject\nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair\nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally\nbased on market evidence. Level 3. Level 3\ninstruments have one or more significant\nvaluation inputs that are not observable.\nAbsent evidence to the contrary, level 3\ninstruments are initially valued at\ntransaction price, which is considered to be\nthe best initial estimate of fair value.\nSubsequently, the firm uses other\nmethodologies to determine fair value, which\nvary based on the type of instrument.\nValuation inputs and assumptions are changed\nwhen corroborated by substantive observable\nevidence, including values realized on sales.\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments\nvary by instrument, but are generally based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques. The valuation\ntechniques and the nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair values of\neach type of level 3 instrument are described\nbelow: Loans and Securities Backed by\nCommercial Real Estate Loans and securities\nbacked by commercial real estate are directly\nor indirectly collateralized by a single\nproperty or a portfolio of properties, and may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. Significant inputs are\ngenerally determined based on relative value\nanalyses and include: \u2022 Market yields implied\nby transactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and changes in market\nindices, such as the CMBX (an index that\ntracks the performance of commercial mortgage\nbonds); \u2022 Transaction prices in both the\nunderlying collateral and instruments with the\nsame or similar underlying collateral; \u2022 A\nmeasure of expected future cash flows in a\ndefault scenario (recovery rates) implied by\nthe value of the underlying collateral, which\nis mainly driven by current performance of the\nunderlying collateral and capitalization\nrates. Recovery rates are expressed as a\npercentage of notional or face value of the\ninstrument and reflect the benefit of credit\nenhancements on certain instruments; and \u2022\nTiming of expected future cash flows\n(duration) which, in certain cases, may\nincorporate the impact of any loan\nforbearances and other unobservable inputs\n(e.g., prepayment speeds). Loans and\nSecurities Backed by Residential Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by residential\nreal estate are directly or indirectly\ncollateralized by portfolios of residential\nreal estate and may include tranches of\nvarying levels of subordination. Significant\ninputs are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons to instruments with similar\ncollateral and risk profiles. Significant\ninputs include: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets; \u2022\nTransaction prices in both the underlying\ncollateral and instruments with the same or\nsimilar underlying collateral; \u2022 Cumulative\nloss expectations, driven by default rates,\nhome price projections, residential property\nliquidation timelines, related costs and\nsubsequent recoveries; and \u2022 Duration, driven\nby underlying loan prepayment speeds and\nresidential property liquidation timelines.\n                                       \n  134    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nCorporate Debt Instruments Corporate debt\ninstruments includes corporate loans, debt\nsecurities and convertible debentures.\nSignificant inputs for corporate debt\ninstruments are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons both to prices of credit default\nswaps that reference the same or similar\nunderlying instrument or entity and to other\ndebt instruments for the same or similar\nissuer for which observable prices or broker\nquotations are available. Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks\nthe performance of corporate credit); \u2022\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions\nand, where the firm uses credit default swaps\nto value the related instrument, the cost of\nborrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n\u2022 Duration; and \u2022 Market and transaction\nmultiples for corporate debt instruments with\nconvertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities Equity securities consists\nof private equities. Recent third-party\ncompleted or pending transactions (e.g.,\nmerger proposals, debt restructurings, tender\noffers) are considered the best evidence for\nany change in fair value. When these are not\navailable, the following valuation\nmethodologies are used, as appropriate: \u2022\nIndustry multiples (primarily EBITDA and\nrevenue multiples) and public comparables; \u2022\nTransactions in similar instruments; \u2022\nDiscounted cash flow techniques; and \u2022 Third-\nparty appraisals. The firm also considers\nchanges in the outlook for the relevant\nindustry and financial performance of the\nissuer as compared to projected performance.\nSignificant inputs include: \u2022 Market and\ntransaction multiples; \u2022 Discount rates and\ncapitalization rates; and \u2022 For equity\nsecurities with debt-like features, market\nyields implied by transactions of similar or\nrelated assets, current performance and\nrecovery assumptions, and duration. Other\nTrading Cash Instruments, Investments and\nLoans The significant inputs to the valuation\nof other instruments, such as non-U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations, state and\nmunicipal obligations, and other loans and\ndebt obligations are generally determined\nbased on relative value analyses, which\nincorporate comparisons both to prices of\ncredit default swaps that reference the same\nor similar underlying instrument or entity and\nto other debt instruments for the same issuer\nfor which observable prices or broker\nquotations are available. Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices; \u2022 Current performance and recovery\nassumptions and, where the firm uses credit\ndefault swaps to value the related instrument,\nthe cost of borrowing the underlying reference\nobligation; and \u2022 Duration. Valuation\nTechniques and Significant Inputs for\nDerivatives The firm\u2019s level 2 and level 3\nderivatives are valued using derivative\npricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow\nmodels, correlation models and models that\nincorporate option pricing methodologies, such\nas Monte Carlo simulations). Price\ntransparency of derivatives can generally be\ncharacterized by product type, as described\nbelow. \u2022 Interest Rate. In general, the key\ninputs used to value interest rate derivatives\nare transparent, even for most long-dated\ncontracts. Interest rate swaps and options\ndenominated in the currencies of leading\nindustrialized nations are characterized by\nhigh trading volumes and tight bid/offer\nspreads. Interest rate derivatives that\nreference indices, such as an inflation index,\nor the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year\nswap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) are more\ncomplex, but the key inputs are generally\nobservable. \u2022 Credit. Price transparency for\ncredit default swaps, including both single\nnames and baskets of credits, varies by market\nand underlying reference entity or obligation.\nCredit default swaps that reference indices,\nlarge corporates and major sovereigns\ngenerally exhibit the most price transparency.\nFor credit default swaps with other\nunderliers, price transparency varies based on\ncredit rating, the cost of borrowing the\nunderlying reference obligations, and the\navailability of the underlying reference\nobligations for delivery upon the default of\nthe issuer. Credit default swaps that\nreference loans, asset-backed securities and\nemerging market debt instruments tend to have\nless price transparency than those that\nreference corporate bonds. In addition, more\ncomplex credit derivatives, such as those\nsensitive to the correlation between two or\nmore underlying reference obligations,\ngenerally have less price transparency.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    135  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n\u2022 Currency. Prices for currency derivatives\nbased on the exchange rates of leading\nindustrialized nations, including those with\nlonger tenors, are generally transparent. The\nprimary difference between the price\ntransparency of developed and emerging market\ncurrency derivatives is that emerging markets\ntend to be only observable for contracts with\nshorter tenors. \u2022 Commodity. Commodity\nderivatives include transactions referenced to\nenergy (e.g., oil, natural gas and\nelectricity), metals (e.g., precious and base)\nand soft commodities (e.g., agricultural).\nPrice transparency varies based on the\nunderlying commodity, delivery location, tenor\nand product quality (e.g., diesel fuel\ncompared to unleaded gasoline). In general,\nprice transparency for commodity derivatives\nis greater for contracts with shorter tenors\nand contracts that are more closely aligned\nwith major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n\u2022 Equity. Price transparency for equity\nderivatives varies by market and underlier.\nOptions on indices and the common stock of\ncorporates included in major equity indices\nexhibit the most price transparency. Equity\nderivatives generally have observable market\nprices, except for contracts with long tenors\nor reference prices that differ significantly\nfrom current market prices. More complex\nequity derivatives, such as those sensitive to\nthe correlation between two or more individual\nstocks, generally have less price\ntransparency. Liquidity is essential to the\nobservability of all product types. If\ntransaction volumes decline, previously\ntransparent prices and other inputs may become\nunobservable. Conversely, even highly\nstructured products may at times have trading\nvolumes large enough to provide observability\nof prices and other inputs. Level 1. Level 1\nderivatives include short-term contracts for\nfuture delivery of securities when the\nunderlying security is a level 1 instrument,\nand exchange-traded derivatives if they are\nactively traded and are valued at their quoted\nmarket price. Level 2. Level 2 derivatives\ninclude OTC derivatives for which all\nsignificant valuation inputs are corroborated\nby market evidence and exchange-traded\nderivatives that are not actively traded\nand/or that are valued using models that\ncalibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC\nderivatives. The selection of a particular\nmodel to value a derivative depends on the\ncontractual terms of and specific risks\ninherent in the instrument, as well as the\navailability of pricing information in the\nmarket. For derivatives that trade in liquid\nmarkets, model selection does not involve\nsignificant management judgment because\noutputs of models can be calibrated to market-\nclearing levels. Valuation models require a\nvariety of inputs, such as contractual terms,\nmarket prices, yield curves, discount rates\n(including those derived from interest rates\non collateral received and posted as specified\nin credit support agreements for\ncollateralized derivatives), credit curves,\nmeasures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss\nseverity rates and correlations of such\ninputs. Significant inputs to the valuations\nof level 2 derivatives can be verified to\nmarket transactions, broker or dealer\nquotations or other alternative pricing\nsources with reasonable levels of price\ntransparency. Consideration is given to the\nnature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or\nexecutable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Level 3 . Level 3\nderivatives are valued using models which\nutilize observable level 1 and/or level 2\ninputs, as well as unobservable level 3\ninputs. The significant unobservable inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s level 3 derivatives\nare described below. \u2022 For level 3 interest\nrate and currency derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include correlations of\ncertain currencies and interest rates (e.g.,\nthe correlation between Euro inflation and\nEuro interest rates) and specific interest\nrate and currency volatilities. \u2022 For level 3\ncredit derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs include illiquid credit spreads and\nupfront credit points, which are unique to\nspecific reference obligations and reference\nentities, and recovery rates. \u2022 For level 3\ncommodity derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include volatilities for\noptions with strike prices that differ\nsignificantly from current market prices and\nprices or spreads for certain products for\nwhich the product quality or physical location\nof the commodity is not aligned with benchmark\nindices. \u2022 For level 3 equity derivatives,\nsignificant unobservable inputs generally\ninclude equity volatility inputs for options\nthat are long-dated and/or have strike prices\nthat differ significantly from current market\nprices. In addition, the valuation of certain\nstructured trades requires the use of level 3\ncorrelation inputs, such as the correlation of\nthe price performance of two or more\nindividual stocks or the correlation of the\nprice performance for a basket of stocks to\nanother asset class, such as commodities.\n                                       \n  136    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level\n3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and\nlevel 2 inputs to reflect observable market\nchanges and any resulting gains and losses are\nclassified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are\nchanged when corroborated by evidence, such as\nsimilar market transactions, third-party\npricing services and/or broker or dealer\nquotations or other empirical market data. In\ncircumstances where the firm cannot verify the\nmodel value by reference to market\ntransactions, it is possible that a different\nvaluation model could produce a materially\ndifferent estimate of fair value. See Note 5\nfor further information about significant\nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of\nlevel 3 derivatives. Valuation Adjustments.\nValuation adjustments are integral to\ndetermining the fair value of derivative\nportfolios and are used to adjust the mid-\nmarket valuations produced by derivative\npricing models to the exit price valuation.\nThese adjustments incorporate bid/offer\nspreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and\nfunding valuation adjustments, which account\nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in\nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative\nportfolios. The firm also makes funding\nvaluation adjustments to collateralized\nderivatives where the terms of the agreement\ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge\ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are\ngenerally used when calibrating valuation\nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In\naddition, for derivatives that include\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm\nmakes model or exit price adjustments to\naccount for the valuation uncertainty present\nin the transaction. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Other Financial\nInstruments at Fair Value In addition to\ntrading cash instruments, derivatives, and\ncertain investments and loans, the firm\naccounts for certain of its other financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value under the\nfair value option. Such instruments include\nresale and repurchase agreements; certain\nsecurities borrowed and loaned transactions;\ncertain customer and other receivables,\nincluding certain margin loans; certain time\ndeposits, including structured certificates of\ndeposit, which are hybrid financial\ninstruments; substantially all other secured\nfinancings, including transfers of assets\naccounted for as financings; certain unsecured\nshort- and long-term borrowings, substantially\nall of which are hybrid financial instruments;\nand certain other assets and liabilities.\nThese instruments are generally valued based\non discounted cash flow techniques, which\nincorporate inputs with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency, and are generally\nclassified in level 2 because the inputs are\nobservable. Valuation adjustments may be made\nfor liquidity and for counterparty and the\nfirm\u2019s credit quality. The significant inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s other financial\ninstruments are described below. Resale and\nRepurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed\nand Loaned. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of resale and repurchase agreements\nand securities borrowed and loaned are funding\nspreads, the amount and timing of expected\nfuture cash flows and interest rates. Customer\nand Other Receivables. The significant inputs\nto the valuation of receivables are interest\nrates, the amount and timing of expected\nfuture cash flows and funding spreads.\nDeposits. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of time deposits are interest rates\nand the amount and timing of future cash\nflows. The inputs used to value the embedded\nderivative component of hybrid financial\ninstruments are consistent with the inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s other derivative\ninstruments described above. See Note 7 for\nfurther information about derivatives and Note\n13 for further information about deposits.\nOther Secured Financings. The significant\ninputs to the valuation of other secured\nfinancings are the amount and timing of\nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,\nfunding spreads and the fair value of the\ncollateral delivered by the firm (determined\nusing the amount and timing of expected future\ncash flows, market prices, market yields and\nrecovery assumptions). See Note 11 for further\ninformation about other secured financings.\nUnsecured Short- and Long-Term Borrowings. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of\nunsecured short- and long-term borrowings are\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, the credit spreads of\nthe firm and commodity prices for prepaid\ncommodity transactions. The inputs used to\nvalue the embedded derivative component of\nhybrid financial instruments are consistent\nwith the inputs used to value the firm\u2019s other\nderivative instruments described above. See\nNote 7 for further information about\nderivatives and Note 14 for further\ninformation about borrowings. Other Assets and\nLiabilities. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other assets and liabilities are\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, market yields,\nvolatility and correlation inputs. The inputs\nused to value the embedded derivative\ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are\nconsistent with the inputs used to value the\nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described\nabove.

An average\ngreater than the median indicates that the\nmajority of inputs are below the average. For\nexample, the difference between the average\nand the median for credit spreads indicates\nthat the majority of the inputs fall in the\nlower end of the range. \u2022 The ranges, averages\nand medians of these inputs are not\nrepresentative of the appropriate inputs to\nuse when calculating the fair value of any one\nderivative. For example, the highest\ncorrelation for interest rate derivatives is\nappropriate for valuing a specific interest\nrate derivative but may not be appropriate for\nvaluing any other interest rate derivative.\nAccordingly, the ranges of inputs do not\nrepresent uncertainty in, or possible ranges\nof, fair value measurements of level 3\nderivatives. \u2022 Interest rates, currencies and\nequities derivatives are valued using option\npricing models, credit derivatives are valued\nusing option pricing, correlation and\ndiscounted cash flow models, and commodities\nderivatives are valued using option pricing\nand discounted cash flow models. \u2022 The fair\nvalue of any one instrument may be determined\nusing multiple valuation techniques. For\nexample, option pricing models and discounted\ncash flow models are typically used together\nto determine fair value. Therefore, the level\n3 balance encompasses both of these\ntechniques. \u2022 Correlation within currencies\nand equities includes cross-product type\ncorrelation. \u2022 Natural gas spread represents\nthe spread per million British thermal units\nof natural gas. \u2022 Oil spread represents the\nspread per barrel of oil and refined products.\n\u2022 Electricity price represents the price per\nmegawatt hour of electricity. Range of\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs for\nDerivatives The following provides information\nabout the ranges of significant unobservable\ninputs used to value the firm\u2019s level 3\nderivative instruments: \u2022 Correlation. Ranges\nfor correlation cover a variety of underliers\nboth within one product type (e.g., equity\nindex and equity single stock names) and\nacross product types (e.g., correlation of an\ninterest rate and a currency), as well as\nacross regions. Generally, cross-product type\ncorrelation inputs are used to value more\ncomplex instruments and are lower than\ncorrelation inputs on assets within the same\nderivative product type. \u2022 Volatility. Ranges\nfor volatility cover numerous underliers\nacross a variety of markets, maturities and\nstrike prices. For example, volatility of\nequity indices is generally lower than\nvolatility of single stocks. \u2022 Credit spreads,\nupfront credit points and recovery rates. The\nranges for credit spreads, upfront credit\npoints and recovery rates cover a variety of\nunderliers (index and single names), regions,\nsectors, maturities and credit qualities\n(high-yield and investment-grade). The broad\nrange of this population gives rise to the\nwidth of the ranges of significant\nunobservable inputs. \u2022 Commodity prices and\nspreads. The ranges for commodity prices and\nspreads cover variability in products,\nmaturities and delivery locations. Sensitivity\nof Fair Value Measurement to Changes in\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs for\nDerivatives The following is a description of\nthe directional sensitivity of the firm\u2019s\nlevel 3 fair value measurements to changes in\nsignificant unobservable inputs, in isolation,\nas of each period-end: \u2022 Correlation. In\ngeneral, for contracts where the holder\nbenefits from the convergence of the\nunderlying asset or index prices (e.g.,\ninterest rates, credit spreads, foreign\nexchange rates, inflation rates and equity\nprices), an increase in correlation results in\na higher fair value measurement. \u2022 Volatility.\nIn general, for purchased options, an increase\nin volatility results in a higher fair value\nmeasurement. \u2022 Credit spreads, upfront credit\npoints and recovery rates. In general, the\nfair value of purchased credit protection\nincreases as credit spreads or upfront credit\npoints increase or recovery rates decrease.\nCredit spreads, upfront credit points and\nrecovery rates are strongly related to\ndistinctive risk factors of the underlying\nreference obligations, which include reference\nentity-specific factors, such as leverage,\nvolatility and industry, market-based risk\nfactors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity\nof the underlying reference obligation, and\nmacroeconomic conditions. \u2022 Commodity prices\nand spreads.

For example,\nthe highest multiple for private equity\nsecurities is appropriate for valuing a\nspecific private equity security but may not\nbe appropriate for valuing any other private\nequity security. Accordingly, the ranges of\ninputs do not represent uncertainty in, or\npossible ranges of, fair value measurements of\nlevel 3 investments.\n\n\u2022 Increases in yield, discount rate,\ncapitalization rate or duration used in the\nvaluation of level 3 investments would have\nresulted in a lower fair value measurement,\nwhile increases in recovery rate or multiples\nwould have resulted in a higher fair value\nmeasurement as of both December 2022 and\nDecember 2021. Due to the distinctive nature\nof each level 3 investment, the\ninterrelationship of inputs is not necessarily\nuniform within each product type.\n\n\u2022 Corporate debt securities, securities backed\nby real estate and other debt obligations are\nvalued using discounted cash flows, and equity\nsecurities are valued using market comparables\nand discounted cash flows.\n\u2022 The fair value of\nany one instrument may\nbe determined using\nmultiple valuation\ntechniques. For\nexample, market\ncomparables and\ndiscounted cash flows\nmay be used together\nto determine fair\nvalue.

See Note 23\nfor further\ninformation about\ninterest income and\ninterest expense.\n\u2022 Gains/(losses)\nincluded in market\nmaking are primarily\nrelated to the firm\u2019s\ntrading assets and\nliabilities, including\nboth derivative and\nnon-derivative\nfinancial instruments.\n\u2022 Gains/(losses) are\nnot representative of\nthe manner in which\nthe firm manages its\nbusiness activities\nbecause many of the\nfirm\u2019s market-making\nand client\nfacilitation\nstrategies utilize\nfinancial instruments\nacross various product\ntypes. Accordingly,\ngains or losses in one\nproduct type\nfrequently offset\ngains or losses in\nother product types.\nFor example, most of\nthe firm\u2019s longer-term\nderivatives across\nproduct types are\nsensitive to changes\nin interest rates and\nmay be economically\nhedged with interest\nrate swaps. Similarly,\na significant portion\nof the firm\u2019s trading\ncash instruments and\nderivatives across\nproduct types has\nexposure to foreign\ncurrencies and may be\neconomically hedged\nwith foreign currency\ncontracts.\nNote 7. Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nDerivative Activities Derivatives are\ninstruments that derive their value from\nunderlying asset prices, indices, reference\nrates and other inputs, or a combination of\nthese factors. Derivatives may be traded on an\nexchange (exchange-traded) or they may be\nprivately negotiated contracts, which are\nusually referred to as OTC derivatives.\nCertain of the firm\u2019s OTC derivatives are\ncleared and settled through central clearing\ncounterparties (OTC-cleared), while others are\nbilateral contracts between two counterparties\n(bilateral OTC).\n\nMarket Making. As a market maker, the firm\nenters into derivative transactions to provide\nliquidity to clients and to facilitate the\ntransfer and hedging of their risks. In this\nrole, the firm typically acts as principal and\nis required to commit capital to provide\nexecution, and maintains market-making\npositions in response to, or in anticipation\nof, client demand. Risk Management. The firm\nalso enters into derivatives to actively\nmanage risk exposures that arise from its\nmarket-making and investing and financing\nactivities. The firm\u2019s holdings and exposures\nare hedged, in many cases, on either a\nportfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed\nto an instrument-by-instrument basis. The\noffsetting impact of this economic hedging is\nreflected in the same business segment as the\nrelated revenues. In addition, the firm may\nenter into derivatives designated as hedges\nunder U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to\nmanage interest rate exposure of certain\nfixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits\nand certain U.S. government securities\nclassified as available-for-sale, foreign\nexchange risk of certain available-for-sale\nsecurities and the net investment in certain\nnon-U.S. operations, and the price risk of\ncertain commodities. The firm enters into\nvarious types of derivatives, including: \u2022\nFutures and Forwards. Contracts that commit\ncounterparties to purchase or sell financial\ninstruments, commodities or currencies in the\nfuture. \u2022 Swaps. Contracts that require\ncounterparties to exchange cash flows, such as\ncurrency or interest payment streams. The\namounts exchanged are based on the specific\nterms of the contract with reference to\nspecified rates, financial instruments,\ncommodities, currencies or indices. \u2022 Options.\nContracts in which the option purchaser has\nthe right, but not the obligation, to purchase\nfrom or sell to the option writer financial\ninstruments, commodities or currencies within\na defined time period for a specified price.\nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or\nreceivable for derivative assets and\nliabilities for a given counterparty) when a\nlegal right of setoff exists under an\nenforceable netting agreement (counterparty\nnetting). Derivatives are accounted for at\nfair value, net of cash collateral received or\nposted under enforceable credit support\nagreements (cash collateral netting).\nDerivative assets are included in trading\nassetsand derivative liabilities are included\nin trading liabilities. Realized and\nunrealized gains and losseson derivatives not\ndesignated as hedges are included in market\nmaking (for derivatives included in Fixed\nIncome, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and\nEquities within Global Banking & Markets), and\nother principal transactions (for derivatives\nincluded in Investment banking fees and Other\nwithin Global Banking & Markets, as well as\nderivatives in Asset & Wealth Management) in\nthe consolidated statements of earnings. For\nboth 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the\nfirm\u2019s derivatives were included in Global\nBanking & Markets.\n                                       \n  152    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Credit\nDerivatives The firm\nenters into a broad\narray of credit\nderivatives to\nfacilitate client\ntransactions and to\nmanage the credit risk\nassociated with\nmarket-making and\ninvesting and\nfinancing activities.\nCredit derivatives are\nactively managed based\non the firm\u2019s net risk\nposition. Credit\nderivatives are\ngenerally individually\nnegotiated contracts\nand can have various\nsettlement and payment\nconventions. Credit\nevents include failure\nto pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of\nindebtedness,\nrestructuring,\nrepudiation and\ndissolution of the\nreference entity. The\nfirm enters into the\nfollowing types of\ncredit derivatives: \u2022\nCredit Default Swaps.\nSingle-name credit\ndefault swaps protect\nthe buyer against the\nloss of principal on\none or more bonds,\nloans or mortgages\n(reference\nobligations) in the\nevent the issuer of\nthe reference\nobligations suffers a\ncredit event. The\nbuyer of protection\npays an initial or\nperiodic premium to\nthe seller and\nreceives protection\nfor the period of the\ncontract. If there is\nno credit event, as\ndefined in the\ncontract, the seller\nof protection makes no\npayments to the buyer.\nIf a credit event\noccurs, the seller of\nprotection is required\nto make a payment to\nthe buyer, calculated\naccording to the terms\nof the contract. \u2022\nCredit Options. In a\ncredit option, the\noption writer assumes\nthe obligation to\npurchase or sell a\nreference obligation\nat a specified price\nor credit spread. The\noption purchaser buys\nthe right, but does\nnot assume the\nobligation, to sell\nthe reference\nobligation to, or\npurchase it from, the\noption writer. The\npayments on credit\noptions depend either\non a particular credit\nspread or the price of\nthe reference\nobligation.\n                                       \n  154    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n\u2022 Credit Indices,\nBaskets and Tranches.\nCredit derivatives may\nreference a basket of\nsingle-name credit\ndefault swaps or a\nbroad-based index. If\na credit event occurs\nin one of the\nunderlying reference\nobligations, the\nprotection seller pays\nthe protection buyer.\nThe payment is\ntypically a pro-rata\nportion of the\ntransaction\u2019s total\nnotional amount based\non the underlying\ndefaulted reference\nobligation. In certain\ntransactions, the\ncredit risk of a\nbasket or index is\nseparated into various\nportions (tranches),\neach having different\nlevels of\nsubordination. The\nmost junior tranches\ncover initial defaults\nand once losses exceed\nthe notional amount of\nthese junior tranches,\nany excess loss is\ncovered by the next\nmost senior tranche. \u2022\nTotal Return Swaps. A\ntotal return swap\ntransfers the risks\nrelating to economic\nperformance of a\nreference obligation\nfrom the protection\nbuyer to the\nprotection seller.\nTypically, the\nprotection buyer\nreceives a floating\nrate of interest and\nprotection against any\nreduction in fair\nvalue of the reference\nobligation, and the\nprotection seller\nreceives the cash\nflows associated with\nthe reference\nobligation, plus any\nincrease in the fair\nvalue of the reference\nobligation. The firm\neconomically hedges\nits exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a\nparticular written\ncredit derivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default. As\nof December 2022,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n528.31billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n579.14billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 50.83billion. As\nof December 2021,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n510.24billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n569.34billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 59.10billion.

Private\nequity, credit and\nreal estate funds are\nclosed-end funds in\nwhich the firm\u2019s\ninvestments are\ngenerally not eligible\nfor redemption.\nDistributions will be\nreceived from these\nfunds as the\nunderlying assets are\nliquidated or\ndistributed, the\ntiming of which is\nuncertain. The firm\nalso invests in hedge\nfunds, primarily\nmulti-disciplinary\nhedge funds that\nemploy a fundamental\nbottom-up investment\napproach across\nvarious asset classes\nand strategies. The\nfirm\u2019s investments in\nhedge funds primarily\ninclude interests\nwhere the underlying\nassets are illiquid in\nnature, and proceeds\nfrom redemptions will\nnot be received until\nthe underlying assets\nare liquidated or\ndistributed, the\ntiming of which is\nuncertain. The firm's\ninvestments in funds\nat NAV includes\ninvestments in\n\u201ccovered funds\u201d as\ndefined in the Volcker\nRule of the U.S. Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act (Dodd-\nFrank Act). To achieve\nconformance with the\ncovered fund\nprovisions of the\nVolcker Rule by July\n2022, the firm\nrestructured certain\nlegacy \u201cilliquid\nfunds\u201d (as defined by\nthe Volcker Rule) to\nbe non-covered funds\nas liquidating trusts.\nHowever, based on\nrecent interpretations\nof the covered fund\nprovisions of the\nVolcker Rule, the firm\nwas required to seek\nan additional\nextension from the\nBoard of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB) to bring\nthese funds into\nconformance. The FRB\ngranted the firm an\nadditional extension\nto July 2023. If the\nfirm does not conform\nsuch funds by July\n2023, the firm will be\nrequired to sell such\ninterests.

Loans\naccounted for at\namortized cost (other\nthan credit card\nloans) are placed on\nnonaccrual status when\nit is probable that\nthe firm will not\ncollect all principal\nand interest due under\nthe contractual terms,\nregardless of the\ndelinquency status or\nif a loan is past due\nfor 90 days or more,\nunless the loan is\nboth well\ncollateralized and in\nthe process of\ncollection. At that\ntime, all accrued but\nuncollected interest\nis reversed against\ninterest income and\ninterest subsequently\ncollected is\nrecognized on a cash\nbasis to the extent\nthe loan balance is\ndeemed collectible.\nOtherwise, all cash\nreceived is used to\nreduce the outstanding\nloan balance. A loan\nis considered past due\nwhen a principal or\ninterest payment has\nnot been made\naccording to its\ncontractual terms.\nCredit card loans are\nnot placed on\nnonaccrual status and\naccrue interest until\nthe loan is paid in\nfull or is charged\noff. In certain\ncircumstances, the\nfirm may modify the\noriginal terms of a\nloan agreement by\ngranting a concession\nto a borrower\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulty, typically\nin the form of a\nmodification of loan\ncovenants, but may\nalso include\nforbearance of\ninterest or principal,\npayment extensions or\ninterest rate\nreductions. These\nmodifications, to the\nextent significant,\nare considered TDRs.\nLoan modifications\nthat extend payment\nterms for a period of\nless than 90 days are\ngenerally considered\ninsignificant and\ntherefore not reported\nas TDRs.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    165  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

To\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, the firm\nclassifies its loans\nand lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at amortized cost\ninto wholesale and\nconsumer portfolios.\nThese portfolios\nrepresent the level at\nwhich the firm has\ndeveloped and\ndocumented its\nmethodology to\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. The allowance\nfor credit losses is\nmeasured on a\ncollective basis for\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics using\na modeled approach and\non an asset-specific\nbasis for loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses takes\ninto account the\nweighted average of a\nrange of forecasts of\nfuture economic\nconditions over the\nexpected life of the\nloan and lending\ncommitments. The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios described\nbelow. The firm\napplies judgment in\nweighing individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including the\nfirm\u2019s internally\nderived economic\noutlook, market\nconsensus, recent\nmacroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends.

The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for wholesale\nloans and lending\ncommitments that\nexhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics is\nmeasured using a\nmodeled approach.\nThese models determine\nthe probability of\ndefault and loss given\ndefault based on\nvarious risk factors,\nincluding internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators, the\nborrower\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial\nobligations, the\nborrower\u2019s country of\nrisk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. For\nlending commitments,\nthe methodology also\nconsiders the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding.\nIn addition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nthe loan-to-value\nratio, debt service\nratio and home price\nindex. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nwholesale loans and\nlending commitments\ninclude unemployment\nrates, GDP, credit\nspreads, commercial\nand industrial\ndelinquency rates,\nshort- and long-term\ninterest rates, and\noil prices. The\nallowance for loan\nlosses for wholesale\nloans that do not\nshare similar risk\ncharacteristics, such\nas nonaccrual loans or\nloans in a TDR, is\ncalculated using the\npresent value of\nexpected future cash\nflows discounted at\nthe loan\u2019s original\neffective rate, the\nobservable market\nprice of the loan or\nthe fair value of the\ncollateral. Wholesale\nloans are charged off\nagainst the allowance\nfor loan losses when\ndeemed to be\nuncollectible.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    167  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for consumer\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics is\ncalculated using a\nmodeled approach which\nclassifies consumer\nloans into pools based\non borrower-related\nand exposure-related\ncharacteristics that\ndifferentiate a pool\u2019s\nrisk characteristics\nfrom other pools. The\nfactors considered in\ndetermining a pool are\ngenerally consistent\nwith the risk\ncharacteristics used\nfor internal credit\nrisk measurement and\nmanagement and include\nkey metrics, such as\nFICO credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nconsumer loans include\nunemployment rates and\ndelinquency rates. The\nexpected life of\nrevolving credit card\nloans is determined by\nmodeling expected\nfuture draws and the\ntiming and amount of\nrepayments allocated\nto the funded balance.\nThe firm also\nrecognizes an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on commitments\nto acquire loans and\ncommitments extended\nin connection with\npoint-of-sale\nfinancing.

As of\nDecember 2022, this\nmulti-scenario\nforecast was weighted\ntowards the baseline\nand adverse economic\nscenarios.\nThe table below presents the forecasted U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates used in\nthe baseline economic scenario of the forecast\nmodel.\n                                              \n  U.S.                                        \n  unemployment                                \n  rate                                        \n  Forecast for the         As of December     \n  quarter ended:           2022               \n  June 2023           4.2  %                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  December 2023       4.6  %                  \n  June 2024           4.6  %                  \n  Growth in U.S.                              \n  GDP                                         \n  Forecast for the                            \n  year:                                       \n  2023                0.4  %                  \n  2024                1.3  %                  \n  2025                1.7  %                  \n                                              \nThe adverse economic scenario of the forecast\nmodel reflects a global recession in 2023 and\na more aggressive tightening of monetary\npolicy by central banks, resulting in an\neconomic contraction and rising unemployment\nrates. In this scenario, the U.S. unemployment\nrate peaks at approximately 7.4% during the\nfirst quarter of 2024 and the maximum decline\nin the quarterly U.S. GDP relative to the\nfourth quarter of 2022 is approximately 2.7%,\nwhich occurs during the fourth quarter of\n2023.\nIn the table above:\n\u2022 U.S. unemployment rate represents the rate\nforecasted as of the respective quarter-end.\n\u2022 Growth in U.S. GDP represents the year-over-\nyear growth rate forecasted for the respective\nyears.\n\u2022 While the U.S.\nunemployment and U.S.\nGDP growth rates are\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model,\nthe model contemplates\na variety of other\ninputs across a range\nof scenarios to\nprovide a forecast of\nfuture economic\nconditions. Given the\ncomplex nature of the\nforecasting process,\nno single economic\nvariable can be viewed\nin isolation and\nindependently of other\ninputs. Allowance for\nCredit Losses\nCommentary Year Ended\nDecember 2022. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses increased by $\n1.97billion during\n2022, reflecting\ngrowth in the firm's\nconsumer lending\nportfolios\n(principally in credit\ncards) and higher\nmodeled expected\nlosses due to broad\nmacroeconomic and\ngeopolitical concerns.\nIn addition, the\nallowance for credit\nlosses for wholesale\nloans was impacted by\nasset-specific\nprovisions and ratings\ndowngrades primarily\nrelated to borrowers\nin the technology,\nmedia &\ntelecommunications,\nreal estate, and\nconsumer & retail\nindustries.\n\nNet (charge-\noffs)/recoveries for\n2022 for wholesale\nloans were primarily\nrelated to corporate\nloans and net (charge-\noffs)/recoveries for\nconsumer loans were\nprimarily related to\ncredit cards. Year\nEnded December 2021.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses\ndecreased by $\n82million during 2021,\nreflecting reserve\nreduction driven by\nimproved broader\neconomic environment,\npartially offset by\ngrowth in the firm\u2019s\nlending portfolios,\nprimarily in the\nconsumer portfolio\nrelated to credit\ncards, including a\nprovision for credit\nlosses of\napproximately $\n185million related to\nthe acquisition of the\nGeneral Motors co-\nbranded credit card\nportfolio. Net\n(charge-\noffs)/recoveries for\n2021 for wholesale\nloans were primarily\nrelated to corporate\nloans and net (charge-\noffs)/recoveries for\nconsumer loans were\nprimarily related to\ncredit cards.\nMeasurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial\nInstruments (ASC 326)\nThe firm adopted ASU\nNo. 2016-13,\n\"Financial Instruments\n- Credit Losses (Topic\n326) - Measurement of\nCredit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments\"\nas of January 1, 2020.\nAs a result of\nadopting this ASU, the\nfirm's allowance for\ncredit losses on\nfinancial assets and\ncommitments that are\naccounted for at\namortized cost\nreflects management's\nestimate of credit\nlosses over the\nremaining life of such\nassets. The cumulative\neffect of adopting\nthis ASU as of January\n1, 2020, was a\ndecrease to retained\nearnings of $\n638million (net of\ntax).

Fair Value Option Other Financial\nAssets and Liabilities at Fair Value In\naddition to trading assets and liabilities,\nand certain investments and loans, the firm\naccounts for certain of its other financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value,\nsubstantially all under the fair value option.\nThe primary reasons for electing the fair\nvalue option are to: \u2022 Reflect economic events\nin earnings on a timely basis; \u2022 Mitigate\nvolatility in earnings from using different\nmeasurement attributes (e.g., transfers of\nfinancial assets accounted for as financings\nare recorded at fair value, whereas the\nrelated secured financing would be recorded on\nan accrual basis absent electing the fair\nvalue option); and \u2022 Address simplification\nand cost-benefit considerations (e.g.,\naccounting for hybrid financial instruments at\nfair value in their entirety versus\nbifurcation of embedded derivatives and hedge\naccounting for debt hosts). Hybrid financial\ninstruments are instruments that contain\nbifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not\nrequire settlement by physical delivery of\nnonfinancial assets (e.g., physical\ncommodities). If the firm elects to bifurcate\nthe embedded derivative from the associated\ndebt, the derivative is accounted for at fair\nvalue and the host contract is accounted for\nat amortized cost, adjusted for the effective\nportion of any fair value hedges. If the firm\ndoes not elect to bifurcate, the entire hybrid\nfinancial instrument is accounted for at fair\nvalue under the fair value option. Other\nfinancial assets and liabilities accounted for\nat fair value under the fair value option\ninclude: \u2022 Resale and repurchase agreements; \u2022\nCertain securities borrowed and loaned\ntransactions; \u2022 Certain customer and other\nreceivables and certain other assets and\nliabilities; \u2022 Certain time deposits (deposits\nwith no stated maturity are not eligible for a\nfair value option election), including\nstructured certificates of deposit, which are\nhybrid financial instruments; \u2022 Substantially\nall other secured financings, including\ntransfers of assets accounted for as\nfinancings; and \u2022 Certain unsecured short- and\nlong-term borrowings, substantially all of\nwhich are hybrid financial instruments. See\nNote 4 for an overview of the firm\u2019s fair\nvalue measurement policies, valuation\ntechniques and significant inputs used to\ndetermine the fair value of other financial\nassets and liabilities, and Note 5 for\ninformation about other financial assets and\nliabilities within the fair value hierarchy.\nGains and Losses on\nOther Financial Assets\nand Liabilities\nAccounted for at Fair\nValue Under the Fair\nValue Option\nThe table below\npresents the gains and\nlosses recognized in\nearnings as a result\nof the election to\napply the fair value\noption to certain\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities.\n                                              \n  $        Y\u2026                                 \n  in       E\u2026                                 \n  m\u2026       D\u2026  20\u2026         20\u2026           20\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U\u2026                                          \n  s\u2026    $  4\u2026       $  -\u2026         $  2\u2026       \n  b\u2026                                          \n  U\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026       6\u2026          -\u2026            -\u2026       \n  b\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       1\u2026          -\u2026            -\u2026       \n  T\u2026    $  1\u2026       $  -\u2026         $  -\u2026       \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 Gains/(losses) were\nsubstantially all\nincluded in market\nmaking.\n\u2022 Gains/(losses)\nexclude contractual\ninterest, which is\nincluded in interest\nincome and interest\nexpense, for all\ninstruments other than\nhybrid financial\ninstruments.

For\nfloating-rate loans\nand lending\ncommitments,\nsubstantially all\nchanges in fair value\nare attributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads, whereas for\nfixed-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nchanges in fair value\nare also attributable\nto changes in interest\nrates.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    171  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\nenters into these\ntransactions in order\nto, among other\nthings, facilitate\nclient activities,\ninvest excess cash,\nacquire securities to\ncover short positions\nand finance certain\nfirm activities.\nCollateralized\nagreements and\nfinancings with the\nsame settlement date\nare presented on a\nnet-by-counterparty\nbasis when such\ntransactions meet\ncertain settlement\ncriteria and are\nsubject to netting\nagreements. Interest\non collateralized\nagreements, which is\nincluded in interest\nincome, and\ncollateralized\nfinancings, which is\nincluded in interest\nexpense, is recognized\nover the life of the\ntransaction. See Note\n23 for further\ninformation about\ninterest income and\ninterest expense.\nResale and Repurchase\nAgreements A resale\nagreement is a\ntransaction in which\nthe firm purchases\nfinancial instruments\nfrom a seller,\ntypically in exchange\nfor cash, and\nsimultaneously enters\ninto an agreement to\nresell the same or\nsubstantially the same\nfinancial instruments\nto the seller at a\nstated price plus\naccrued interest at a\nfuture date. A\nrepurchase agreement\nis a transaction in\nwhich the firm sells\nfinancial instruments\nto a buyer, typically\nin exchange for cash,\nand simultaneously\nenters into an\nagreement to\nrepurchase the same or\nsubstantially the same\nfinancial instruments\nfrom the buyer at a\nstated price plus\naccrued interest at a\nfuture date. Even\nthough repurchase and\nresale agreements\n(including \u201crepos- and\nreverses-to-maturity\u201d)\ninvolve the legal\ntransfer of ownership\nof financial\ninstruments, they are\naccounted for as\nfinancing arrangements\nbecause they require\nthe financial\ninstruments to be\nrepurchased or resold\nbefore or at the\nmaturity of the\nagreement. The\nfinancial instruments\npurchased or sold in\nresale and repurchase\nagreements typically\ninclude U.S.\ngovernment and agency,\nand investment-grade\nsovereign obligations.\nThe firm receives\nfinancial instruments\npurchased under resale\nagreements and makes\ndelivery of financial\ninstruments sold under\nrepurchase agreements.\nTo mitigate credit\nexposure, the firm\nmonitors the market\nvalue of these\nfinancial instruments\non a daily basis, and\ndelivers or obtains\nadditional collateral\ndue to changes in the\nmarket value of the\nfinancial instruments,\nas appropriate. For\nresale agreements, the\nfirm typically\nrequires collateral\nwith a fair value\napproximately equal to\nthe carrying value of\nthe relevant assets in\nthe consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nSecurities Borrowed\nand Loaned\nTransactions In a\nsecurities borrowed\ntransaction, the firm\nborrows securities\nfrom a counterparty in\nexchange for cash or\nsecurities. When the\nfirm returns the\nsecurities, the\ncounterparty returns\nthe cash or\nsecurities. Interest\nis generally paid\nperiodically over the\nlife of the\ntransaction. In a\nsecurities loaned\ntransaction, the firm\nlends securities to a\ncounterparty in\nexchange for cash or\nsecurities. When the\ncounterparty returns\nthe securities, the\nfirm returns the cash\nor securities posted\nas collateral.\nInterest is generally\npaid periodically over\nthe life of the\ntransaction. The firm\nreceives securities\nborrowed and makes\ndelivery of securities\nloaned. To mitigate\ncredit exposure, the\nfirm monitors the\nmarket value of these\nsecurities on a daily\nbasis, and delivers or\nobtains additional\ncollateral due to\nchanges in the market\nvalue of the\nsecurities, as\nappropriate. For\nsecurities borrowed\ntransactions, the firm\ntypically requires\ncollateral with a fair\nvalue approximately\nequal to the carrying\nvalue of the\nsecurities borrowed\ntransaction.\nSecurities borrowed\nand loaned within FICC\nfinancing are recorded\nat fair value under\nthe fair value option.\nSee Note 5 for further\ninformation about\nsecurities borrowed\nand loaned accounted\nfor at fair value.\nSubstantially all of\nthe securities\nborrowed and loaned\nwithin Equities\nfinancing are recorded\nbased on the amount of\ncash collateral\nadvanced or received\nplus accrued interest.\nThe firm also reviews\nsuch securities\nborrowed to determine\nif an allowance for\ncredit losses should\nbe recorded by taking\ninto consideration the\nfair value of\ncollateral received.\nAs these agreements\ngenerally can be\nterminated on demand,\nthey exhibit little,\nif any, sensitivity to\nchanges in interest\nrates. Therefore, the\ncarrying value of such\nagreements\napproximates fair\nvalue. As these\nagreements are not\naccounted for at fair\nvalue, they are not\nincluded in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy\nin Notes 4 and 5.

Other secured\nfinancings that are\nnot recorded at fair\nvalue are recorded\nbased on the amount of\ncash received plus\naccrued interest,\nwhich generally\napproximates fair\nvalue.

The\ncarrying value of each\nreporting unit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nIdentifiable\nIntangible Assets\nThe table below presents identifiable\nintangible assets by type.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Cust\u2026                                       \n  lists                                       \n  and                                         \n  merc\u2026         As of                         \n  rela\u2026       Decemb\u2026  2022             2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Gross                                       \n  carr\u2026    $    3,225        $   1,460        \n  value                                       \n  Accu\u2026        -1,275           -1,130        \n  amor\u2026                                       \n  Net                                         \n  carr\u2026         1,950              330        \n  value                                       \n  Acqu\u2026                                       \n  leas\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  other                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  carr\u2026           486              500        \n  value                                       \n  Accu\u2026          -427             -412        \n  amor\u2026                                       \n  Net                                         \n  carr\u2026            59               88        \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  gross         3,711            1,960        \n  carr\u2026                                       \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  accu\u2026        -1,702           -1,542        \n  amor\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  net      $    2,009        $     418        \n  carr\u2026                                       \n  value                                       \n                                              \nThe firm acquired\napproximately $\n1.79billion of\nidentifiable\nintangible assets\n(with a weighted\naverage amortization\nperiod of 13years)\nduring 2022,\nsubstantially all in\nconnection with the\nacquisitions of\nGreenSky and NNIP.\nSubstantially all of\nthese identifiable\nintangible assets\nconsisted of customer\nlists and merchant\nrelationships.

For leases\nlonger than one year,\nthe firm recognizes a\nright-of-use asset\nrepresenting the right\nto use the underlying\nasset for the lease\nterm, and a lease\nliability representing\nthe liability to make\npayments. The lease\nterm is generally\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual\nmaturity of the lease.\nFor leases where the\nfirm has the option to\nterminate or extend\nthe lease, an\nassessment of the\nlikelihood of\nexercising the option\nis incorporated into\nthe determination of\nthe lease term. Such\nassessment is\ninitially performed at\nthe inception of the\nlease and is updated\nif events occur that\nimpact the original\nassessment. An\noperating lease right-\nof-use asset is\ninitially determined\nbased on the operating\nlease liability,\nadjusted for initial\ndirect costs, lease\nincentives and amounts\npaid at or prior to\nlease commencement.\nThis amount is then\namortized over the\nlease term.Right-of-\nuse assets and\noperating lease\nliabilities recognized\n(in non-cash\ntransactions for\nleases entered into or\nassumed) by the firm\nwere $ 256million for\n2022, $ 305million for\n2021 and $ 182million\nfor 2020. See Note 15\nfor information about\noperating lease\nliabilities. For\nleases where the firm\nwill derive no\neconomic benefit from\nleased space that it\nhas vacated or where\nthe firm has shortened\nthe term of a lease\nwhen space is no\nlonger needed, the\nfirm will record an\nimpairment or\naccelerated\namortization of right-\nof-use assets.There\nwere no material\nimpairments or\naccelerated\namortizations during\n2022 and 2021.\nMiscellaneous\nReceivables

Note 16.\nSecuritization Activities The firm securitizes\nresidential and commercial mortgages,\ncorporate bonds, loans and other types of\nfinancial assets by selling these assets to\nsecuritization vehicles (e.g., trusts,\ncorporate entities and limited liability\ncompanies) or through a resecuritization. The\nfirm acts as underwriter of the beneficial\ninterests that are sold to investors.

The firm\ngenerally receives\ncash in exchange for\nthe transferred assets\nbut may also have\ncontinuing involvement\nwith the transferred\nfinancial assets,\nincluding ownership of\nbeneficial interests\nin securitized\nfinancial assets,\nprimarily in the form\nof debt instruments.\nThe firm may also\npurchase senior or\nsubordinated\nsecurities issued by\nsecuritization\nvehicles (which are\ntypically VIEs) in\nconnection with\nsecondary market-\nmaking activities. The\nprimary risks included\nin beneficial\ninterests and other\ninterests from the\nfirm\u2019s continuing\ninvolvement with\nsecuritization\nvehicles are the\nperformance of the\nunderlying collateral,\nthe position of the\nfirm\u2019s investment in\nthe capital structure\nof the securitization\nvehicle and the market\nyield for the\nsecurity. Interests\naccounted for at fair\nvalue are primarily\nclassified in level 2\nof the fair value\nhierarchy. Interests\nnot accounted for at\nfair value are carried\nat amounts that\napproximate fair\nvalue.

Due to the\nnature and fair value of certain of these\nretained interests, the weighted average\nassumptions for constant prepayment and\ndiscount rates and the related sensitivity to\nadverse changes are not meaningful as of both\nDecember 2022 and December 2021. The firm\u2019s\nmaximum exposure to adverse changes in the\nvalue of these interests is the carrying value\nof $ 398million as of December 2022 and $\n360million as of December 2021.\n\nNote 17. Variable Interest Entities A variable\ninterest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt\nor equity) or other interest (e.g.,\nderivatives or loans and lending commitments)\nthat will absorb portions of the VIE\u2019s\nexpected losses and/or receive portions of the\nVIE\u2019s expected residual returns. The firm\u2019s\nvariable interests in VIEs include senior and\nsubordinated debt; loans and lending\ncommitments; limited and general partnership\ninterests; preferred and common equity;\nderivatives that may include foreign currency,\nequity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and\ncertain of the fees the firm receives from\ninvestment funds. Certain interest rate,\nforeign currency and credit derivatives the\nfirm enters into with VIEs are not variable\ninterests because they create, rather than\nabsorb, risk. VIEs generally finance the\npurchase of assets by issuing debt and equity\nsecurities that are either collateralized by\nor indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The\ndebt and equity securities issued by a VIE may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. The firm\u2019s involvement with\nVIEs includes securitization of financial\nassets, as described in Note 16, and\ninvestments in and loans to other types of\nVIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the\nfirm\u2019s consolidation policies, including the\ndefinition of a VIE. VIE Consolidation\nAnalysis The enterprise with a controlling\nfinancial interest in a VIE is known as the\nprimary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE.\nThe firm determines whether it is the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis\nthat principally considers: \u2022 Which variable\ninterest holder has the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly\nimpact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; \u2022 Which\nvariable interest holder has the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s purpose\nand design, including the risks the VIE was\ndesigned to create and pass through to its\nvariable interest holders; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s capital\nstructure; \u2022 The terms between the VIE and its\nvariable interest holders and other parties\ninvolved with the VIE; and \u2022 Related-party\nrelationships.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    185  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nThe firm reassesses\nits evaluation of\nwhether an entity is a\nVIE when certain\nreconsideration events\noccur. The firm\nreassesses its\ndetermination of\nwhether it is the\nprimary beneficiary of\na VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current\nfacts and\ncircumstances. VIE\nActivities The firm is\nprincipally involved\nwith VIEs through the\nfollowing business\nactivities: Mortgage-\nBacked VIEs. The firm\nsells residential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans and securities\nto mortgage-backed\nVIEs and may retain\nbeneficial interests\nin the assets sold to\nthese VIEs. The firm\npurchases and sells\nbeneficial interests\nissued by mortgage-\nbacked VIEs in\nconnection with\nmarket-making\nactivities. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into derivatives\nwith certain of these\nVIEs, primarily\ninterest rate swaps,\nwhich are typically\nnot variable\ninterests. The firm\ngenerally enters into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk.\nReal Estate, Credit-\nand Power-Related and\nOther Investing VIEs.\nThe firm purchases\nequity and debt\nsecurities issued by\nand makes loans to\nVIEs that hold real\nestate, performing and\nnonperforming debt,\ndistressed loans,\npower-related assets\nand equity securities.\nThe firm generally\ndoes not sell assets\nto, or enter into\nderivatives with,\nthese VIEs. Corporate\nDebt and Other Asset-\nBacked VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue notes to\nclients, purchases and\nsells beneficial\ninterests issued by\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs in connection\nwith market-making\nactivities, and makes\nloans to VIEs that\nwarehouse corporate\ndebt. Certain of these\nVIEs synthetically\ncreate the exposure\nfor the beneficial\ninterests they issue\nby entering into\ncredit derivatives\nwith the firm, rather\nthan purchasing the\nunderlying assets. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into\nderivatives, such as\ntotal return swaps,\nwith certain corporate\ndebt and other asset-\nbacked VIEs, under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE a return due\nto the beneficial\ninterest holders and\nreceives the return on\nthe collateral owned\nby the VIE. The\ncollateral owned by\nthese VIEs is\nprimarily other asset-\nbacked loans and\nsecurities. The firm\nmay be removed as the\ntotal return swap\ncounterparty and may\nenter into derivatives\nwith other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk\nrelated to these\nswaps. The firm may\nsell assets to the\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs it structures.\n\nPrincipal-Protected\nNote VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs\nown portfolios of\nassets, principally\nwith exposure to hedge\nfunds. Substantially\nall of the principal\nprotection on the\nnotes issued by these\nVIEs is provided by\nthe asset portfolio\nrebalancing that is\nrequired under the\nterms of the notes.\nThe firm enters into\ntotal return swaps\nwith these VIEs under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE the return due\nto the principal-\nprotected note holders\nand receives the\nreturn on the assets\nowned by the VIE.

Commitments\nThe firm\u2019s commercial\nand warehouse\nfinancing lending\ncommitments are\nagreements to lend\nwith fixed termination\ndates and depend on\nthe satisfaction of\nall contractual\nconditions to\nborrowing. These\ncommitments are\npresented net of\namounts syndicated to\nthird parties. The\ntotal commitment\namount does not\nnecessarily reflect\nactual future cash\nflows because the firm\nmay syndicate portions\nof these commitments.\nIn addition,\ncommitments can expire\nunused or be reduced\nor cancelled at the\ncounterparty\u2019s\nrequest. The firm also\nprovides credit to\nconsumers by issuing\ncredit card lines and\nthrough commitments to\nprovide unsecured\ninstallment loans.\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout lending\ncommitments.\n                                              \n  $ in          As of                         \n  mill\u2026       Decemb\u2026  2022             2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Held                                        \n  for      $  222,689        $  197,1\u2026        \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Held                                        \n  for           3,355           13,175        \n  sale                                        \n  At                                          \n  fair          1,094            1,257        \n  value                                       \n  Total    $  227,138        $  211,5\u2026        \n                                              \n                                       \n  188    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The carrying value of lending\ncommitments was a liability of $ 1.01billion\n(including allowance for credit losses of $\n774million) as of December 2022 and $\n1.05billion (including allowance for credit\nlosses of $ 776million) as of December 2021.\nThe estimated fair value of such lending\ncommitments was a liability of $ 5.95billion\nas of December 2022 and $ 4.17billion as of\nDecember 2021. Had these lending commitments\nbeen carried at fair value and included in the\nfair value hierarchy, $ 3.11billion as of\nDecember 2022 and $ 1.91billion as of December\n2021 would have been classified in level 2,\nand $ 2.84billion as of December 2022 and $\n2.26billion as of December 2021 would have\nbeen classified in level 3. \u2022 Held for sale\nlending commitments are accounted for at the\nlower of cost or fair value. The carrying\nvalue of lending commitments held for sale was\na liability of $ 88million as of December 2022\nand $ 91million as of December 2021. The\nestimated fair value of such lending\ncommitments approximates the carrying value.\nHad these lending commitments been included in\nthe fair value hierarchy, they would have been\nprimarily classified in level 3 as of both\nDecember 2022 and December 2021. \u2022 Gains or\nlosses related to lending commitments at fair\nvalue, if any, are generally recorded net of\nany fees in other principal transactions.\nCommercial Lending.

The firm also extends\nlending commitments in connection with other\ntypes of corporate lending, commercial real\nestate financing and other collateralized\nlending.See Note 9 for further information\nabout funded loans. To mitigate the credit\nrisk associated with the firm\u2019s commercial\nlending activities, the firm obtains credit\nprotection on certain loans and lending\ncommitments through credit default swaps, both\nsingle-name and index-based contracts, and\nthrough the issuance of credit-linked notes.\nWarehouse Financing.

The\nincrease in these lending commitments from\nDecember 2021 to December 2022 primarily\nrelated to commitments extended in connection\nwith point-of-sale financing.

See the tables in\n\u201cCommitments\u201d above for a summary of the\nfirm\u2019s commitments.\n\u2022 The carrying value\nfor derivatives\nincluded derivative\nassets of $ 578million\nas of December 2022\nand $ 1.10billion as\nof December 2021, and\nderivative liabilities\nof $ 8.06billion as of\nDecember 2022 and $\n4.51billion as of\nDecember 2021.\nDerivative Guarantees.\nThe firm enters into\nvarious derivatives\nthat meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee under U.S.\nGAAP, including\nwritten equity and\ncommodity put options,\nwritten currency\ncontracts and interest\nrate caps, floors and\nswaptions. These\nderivatives are risk\nmanaged together with\nderivatives that do\nnot meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, and\ntherefore the amounts\nin the table above do\nnot reflect the firm\u2019s\noverall risk related\nto derivative\nactivities.\nDisclosures about\nderivatives are not\nrequired if they may\nbe cash settled and\nthe firm has no basis\nto conclude it is\nprobable that the\ncounterparties held\nthe underlying\ninstruments at the\ninception of the\ncontract. The firm has\nconcluded that these\nconditions have been\nmet for certain large,\ninternationally active\ncommercial and\ninvestment bank\ncounterparties,\ncentral clearing\ncounterparties, hedge\nfunds and certain\nother counterparties.\nAccordingly, the firm\nhas not included such\ncontracts in the table\nabove. See Note 7 for\ninformation about\ncredit derivatives\nthat meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, which are\nnot included in the\ntable above.\nDerivatives are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue and therefore\nthe carrying value is\nconsidered the best\nindication of\npayment/performance\nrisk for individual\ncontracts. However,\nthe carrying values in\nthe table above\nexclude the effect of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting.\nSecurities Lending and\nClearing Guarantees .\nSecurities lending and\nclearing guarantees\ninclude the\nindemnifications and\nguarantees that the\nfirm provides in its\ncapacity as an agency\nlender and in its\ncapacity as a\nsponsoring member of\nthe Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation.\nAs an agency lender,\nthe firm indemnifies\nmost of its securities\nlending customers\nagainst losses\nincurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not\nreturn securities and\nthe collateral held is\ninsufficient to cover\nthe market value of\nthe securities\nborrowed.The maximum\npayout of such\nindemnifications was $\n12.23billion as of\nDecember 2022 and $\n11.05billion as of\nDecember 2021.\nCollateral held by the\nlenders in connection\nwith securities\nlending\nindemnifications was $\n12.62billion as of\nDecember 2022 and $\n11.36billion as of\nDecember 2021. Because\nthe contractual nature\nof these arrangements\nrequires the firm to\nobtain collateral with\na market value that\nexceeds the value of\nthe securities lent to\nthe borrower, there is\nminimal performance\nrisk associated with\nthese\nindemnifications.\n                                       \n  190    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nAs a sponsoring member of the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the\nperformance of its sponsored member clients to\nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in\nconnection with certain resale and repurchase\nagreements. To minimize potential losses on\nsuch guarantees, the firm obtains a security\ninterest in the collateral that the sponsored\nclient placed with the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on\nsuch guarantees is minimal. As of December\n2022, the maximum payout on this guarantee was\n$ 8.74billion and the related collateral held\nwas $ 8.70billion. There were noamounts\noutstanding under the guarantee as of December\n2021. Other Financial Guarantees . In the\nordinary course of business, the firm provides\nother financial guarantees of the obligations\nof third parties (e.g., standby letters of\ncredit and other guarantees to enable clients\nto complete transactions and fund-related\nguarantees). These guarantees represent\nobligations to make payments to beneficiaries\nif the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its\nobligation under a contractual arrangement\nwith that beneficiary.Other financial\nguarantees also include a guarantee that the\nfirm has provided to the Government of\nMalaysia that it will receive, by August 2025,\nat least $ 1.4billion in assets and proceeds\nfrom assets seized by governmental authorities\naround the world related to 1Malaysia\nDevelopment Berhad, a sovereign wealth fund in\nMalaysia (1MDB). In connection with this\nguarantee, the firm is also required to make a\none-time interim payment of $ 250million\ntowards the $ 1.4billion if the Government of\nMalaysia has not received at least $\n500million in assets and proceeds by August\n2022. The firm considers the reports that it\nreceives on a semi-annual basis, expected in\nFebruary and August, in evaluating the\nprogress of Malaysia\u2019s recovery efforts. The\nfirm and the Government of Malaysia disagree\nabout and, following an extension of the\ncontractual dispute resolution period,\ncontinue to discuss whether the Government of\nMalaysia did, in fact, recover at least $\n500million as of August 2022 and whether any\ninterim payment was due. If the parties are\nunable to resolve this dispute, it would be\nsettled by arbitration. Any amounts paid by\nthe firm would, in any event, be subject to\nreimbursement in the event the assets and\nproceeds received by the Government of\nMalaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed $\n1.4billion. See Note 27 for further\ninformation about matters related to 1MDB.\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The\nfirm has established trusts, including Goldman\nSachs Capital I, Goldman Sachs Capital II and\nGoldman Sachs Capital III (the Trusts), and\nother entities, for the limited purpose of\nissuing securities to third parties, lending\nthe proceeds to the firm and entering into\ncontractual arrangements with the firm and\nthird parties related to this purpose. The\nfirm does not consolidate these entities. See\nNotes 14 and 19 for further information about\nthe transactions involving the Trusts. The\nfirm effectively provides for the full and\nunconditional guarantee of the securities\nissued by these entities. Timely payment by\nthe firm of amounts due to these entities\nunder the guarantee, borrowing, preferred\nstock and related contractual arrangements\nwill be sufficient to cover payments due on\nthe securities issued by these entities. No\nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the\nsecurities of the Trusts. Management believes\nthat it is unlikely that any circumstances\nwill occur, such as nonperformance on the part\nof paying agents or other service providers,\nthat would make it necessary for the firm to\nmake payments related to these entities other\nthan those required under the terms of the\nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and\nrelated contractual arrangements and in\nconnection with certain expenses incurred by\nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of\nService Providers. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees\ncertain service providers, such as clearing\nand custody agents, trustees and\nadministrators, against specified potential\nlosses in connection with their acting as an\nagent of, or providing services to, the firm\nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses\narising from its custodial role or caused by\nacts or omissions of third-party service\nproviders, including sub-custodians and third-\nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has\nthe right to seek indemnification from these\nthird-party service providers for certain\nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In\naddition, the firm is a member of payment,\nclearing and settlement networks, as well as\nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of\nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of\nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In\nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear\nand settle transactions entered into by\nclients with other brokerage firms. The firm\u2019s\nobligations in respect of such transactions\nare secured by the assets in the client\u2019s\naccount and proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the firm\non behalf of the client. In connection with\njoint venture investments, the firm may issue\nloan guarantees under which it may be liable\nin the event of fraud, misappropriation,\nenvironmental liabilities and other matters\ninvolving the borrower.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    191  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Other\nRepresentations,\nWarranties and\nIndemnifications. The\nfirm provides\nrepresentations and\nwarranties to\ncounterparties in\nconnection with a\nvariety of commercial\ntransactions and\noccasionally\nindemnifies them\nagainst potential\nlosses caused by the\nbreach of those\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. The firm\nmay also provide\nindemnifications\nprotecting against\nchanges in or adverse\napplication of certain\nU.S. tax laws in\nconnection with\nordinary-course\ntransactions, such as\nsecurities issuances,\nborrowings or\nderivatives. In\naddition, the firm may\nprovide\nindemnifications to\nsome counterparties to\nprotect them in the\nevent additional taxes\nare owed or payments\nare withheld, due\neither to a change in\nor an adverse\napplication of certain\nnon-U.S. tax laws.\nThese indemnifications\ngenerally are standard\ncontractual terms and\nare entered into in\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness. Generally,\nthere are no stated or\nnotional amounts\nincluded in these\nindemnifications, and\nthe contingencies\ntriggering the\nobligation to\nindemnify are not\nexpected to occur. The\nfirm is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder these guarantees\nand indemnifications.\nHowever, management\nbelieves that it is\nunlikely the firm will\nhave to make any\nmaterial payments\nunder these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\narrangements have been\nrecognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both\nDecember 2022 and\nDecember 2021.\nGuarantees of\nSubsidiaries. Group\nInc. is the entity\nthat fully and\nunconditionally\nguarantees the\nsecurities issued by\nGS Finance Corp., a\nwholly-owned finance\nsubsidiary of the\nfirm. Group Inc. has\nguaranteed the payment\nobligations of Goldman\nSachs & Co. LLC\n(GS&Co.), GS Bank USA\nand Goldman Sachs\nParis Inc. et Cie,\nsubject to certain\nexceptions. In\naddition, Group Inc.\nhas provided\nguarantees to Goldman\nSachs International\n(GSI) and GSBE related\nto agreements that\neach entity has\nentered into with\ncertain of its\ncounterparties.

Group\nInc. is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder its subsidiary\nguarantees.

Regulation\nand Capital Adequacy\nThe FRB is the primary\nregulator of Group\nInc., a bank holding\ncompany under the U.S.\nBank Holding Company\nAct of 1956 and a\nfinancial holding\ncompany under\namendments to this\nAct. The firm is\nsubject to\nconsolidated\nregulatory capital\nrequirements which are\ncalculated in\naccordance with the\nregulations of the FRB\n(Capital Framework).\nThe capital\nrequirements are\nexpressed as risk-\nbased capital and\nleverage ratios that\ncompare measures of\nregulatory capital to\nrisk-weighted assets\n(RWAs), average assets\nand off-balance sheet\nexposures. Failure to\ncomply with these\ncapital requirements\nwould result in\nrestrictions being\nimposed by the firm\u2019s\nregulators and could\nlimit the firm\u2019s\nability to repurchase\nshares, pay dividends\nand make certain\ndiscretionary\ncompensation payments.\nThe firm\u2019s capital\nlevels are also\nsubject to qualitative\njudgments by the\nregulators about\ncomponents of capital,\nrisk weightings and\nother factors.\nFurthermore, certain\nof the firm\u2019s\nsubsidiaries are\nsubject to separate\nregulations and\ncapital requirements.\nCapital Framework The\nregulations under the\nCapital Framework are\nlargely based on the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\u2019s\n(Basel Committee)\ncapital framework for\nstrengthening\ninternational capital\nstandards (Basel III)\nand also implement\ncertain provisions of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act.\nUnder the Capital\nFramework, the firm is\nan \u201cAdvanced\napproaches\u201d banking\norganization and has\nbeen designated as a\nglobal systemically\nimportant bank\n(G-SIB). The Capital\nFramework includes the\nminimum risk-based\ncapital and the\ncapital conservation\nbuffer requirements.\nThe buffer must\nconsist entirely of\ncapital that qualifies\nas Common Equity Tier\n1 (CET1) capital. The\nfirm calculates its\nCET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total\ncapital ratios in\naccordance with both\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules. Each of the\nratios calculated\nunder the Standardized\nand Advanced Capital\nRules must meet its\nrespective capital\nrequirements. Under\nthe Capital Framework,\nthe firm is also\nsubject to leverage\nrequirements which\nconsist of a minimum\nTier 1 leverage ratio\nand a minimum\nsupplementary leverage\nratio (SLR), as well\nas the SLR buffer.\n\nConsolidated\nRegulatory Capital\nRequirements\nRisk-Based Capital\nRatios.

The\nG-SIB surcharge is\ncalculated using two\nmethodologies, the\nhigher of which is\nreflected in the\nfirm\u2019s risk-based\ncapital requirements.\nThe first calculation\n(Method 1) is based on\nthe Basel Committee\u2019s\nmethodology which,\namong other factors,\nrelies upon measures\nof the size, activity\nand complexity of each\nG-SIB. The second\ncalculation (Method 2)\nuses similar inputs\nbut includes a measure\nof reliance on short-\nterm wholesale\nfunding.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    195  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

RWAs are\ncalculated in\naccordance with both\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules. Credit Risk\nCredit RWAs are\ncalculated based on\nmeasures of exposure,\nwhich are then risk\nweighted under the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules: \u2022 The\nStandardized Capital\nRules apply prescribed\nrisk-weights, which\ndepend largely on the\ntype of counterparty.\nThe exposure measures\nfor derivatives and\nsecurities financing\ntransactions are based\non specific formulas\nwhich take certain\nfactors into\nconsideration. \u2022 Under\nthe Advanced Capital\nRules, the firm\ncomputes risk-weights\nfor wholesale and\nretail credit\nexposures in\naccordance with the\nAdvanced Internal\nRatings-Based\napproach.

Market\nRWAs are calculated\nbased on measures of\nexposure which include\nthe following: \u2022\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) is\nthe potential loss in\nvalue of trading\nassets and\nliabilities, as well\nas certain\ninvestments, loans,\nand other financial\nassets and liabilities\naccounted for at fair\nvalue, due to adverse\nmarket movements over\na defined time horizon\nwith a specified\nconfidence level.\n                                       \n  198    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For\nrisk management\npurposes, a 95% one-\ndayVaR is used,\nwhereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements,\na 99% 10-dayVaR is\nused to determine\nMarket RWAs and a 99%\none-dayVaR is used to\ndetermine regulatory\nVaR exceptions. In\naddition, the daily\nnet revenues used to\ndetermine risk\nmanagement VaR\nexceptions (i.e.,\ncomparing the daily\nnet revenues to the\nVaR measure calculated\nas of the end of the\nprior business day)\ninclude intraday\nactivity, whereas the\nCapital Framework\nrequires that intraday\nactivity be excluded\nfrom daily net\nrevenues when\ncalculating regulatory\nVaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity\nincludes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are\nmore likely than not\nto be positive by\ntheir nature. As a\nresult, there may be\ndifferences in the\nnumber of VaR\nexceptions and the\namount of daily net\nrevenues calculated\nfor regulatory VaR\ncompared to the\namounts calculated for\nrisk management VaR.\nThe firm\u2019s positional\nlosses observed on a\nsingle day exceeded\nits 99% one-\ndayregulatory VaR on\none occasion during\neach of the years\nended 2022 and 2021.\nThere was no change in\nthe firm\u2019s VaR\nmultiplier used to\ncalculate Market RWAs;\n\u2022 Stressed VaR is the\npotential loss in\nvalue of trading\nassets and\nliabilities, as well\nas certain\ninvestments, loans,\nand other financial\nassets and liabilities\naccounted for at fair\nvalue, during a period\nof significant market\nstress; \u2022 Incremental\nrisk is the potential\nloss in value of non-\nsecuritized positions\ndue to the default or\ncredit migration of\nissuers of financial\ninstruments over a\none-year time horizon;\n\u2022 Comprehensive risk\nis the potential loss\nin value, due to price\nrisk and defaults,\nwithin the firm\u2019s\ncredit correlation\npositions; and \u2022\nSpecific risk is the\nrisk of loss on a\nposition that could\nresult from factors\nother than broad\nmarket movements,\nincluding event risk,\ndefault risk and\nidiosyncratic risk.\nThe standardized\nmeasurement method is\nused to determine\nspecific risk RWAs, by\napplying supervisory\ndefined risk-weighting\nfactors after\napplicable netting is\nperformed.\n\nOperational Risk\nOperational RWAs are\nonly required to be\nincluded under the\nAdvanced Capital\nRules.

As of\nDecember 2022, the\nfirm has recorded\ndeferred tax assets of\n$ 41million in\nconnection with\ngeneral business\ncredit carryforwards\nand $ 9million in\nconnection with state\nand local tax credit\ncarryforwards. If not\nutilized, the foreign\ntax credit\ncarryforward will\nbegin to expire in\n2033, the general\nbusiness credit\ncarryforward will\nbegin to expire in\n2023 and the state and\nlocal tax credit\ncarryforward will\nbegin to expire in\n2024. As of both\nDecember 2022 and\nDecember 2021, the\nfirm had no U.S.\ncapital loss\ncarryforwards and\nnorelated net deferred\nincome tax assets. As\nof December 2022, the\nfirm had deferred tax\nassets of $ 277million\nin connection with\nforeign capital loss\ncarryforwards and a\nvaluation allowance of\n$ 277million related\nto these capital loss\ncarryforwards. The\nvaluation allowance\nincreased by $\n674million during 2022\nand increased by $\n344million during\n2021. The increases in\nboth 2022 and 2021\nwere primarily due to\nan increase in\ndeferred tax assets\nfrom which the firm\ndoes not expect to\nrealize any benefit.\nThe firm permanently\nreinvested eligible\nearnings of certain\nforeign subsidiaries.\nAs of both December\n2022 and December\n2021, all U.S. taxes\nwere accrued on these\nsubsidiaries\u2019\ndistributable\nearnings.\n                                       \n  206    Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

A\nposition that meets\nthis standard is\nmeasured at the\nlargest amount of\nbenefit that will more\nlikely than not be\nrealized on\nsettlement. A\nliability is\nestablished for\ndifferences between\npositions taken in a\ntax return and amounts\nrecognized in the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. The\naccrued liability for\ninterest expense\nrelated to income tax\nmatters and income tax\npenalties was $\n205million as of\nDecember 2022 and $\n131million as of\nDecember 2021. The\nfirm recognized\ninterest expense and\nincome tax penalties\nof $ 59million for\n2022, $ 13million for\n2021 and $ 41million\nfor 2020.

The firm\nallocates assets\n(including allocations\nof global core liquid\nassets and cash,\nsecured client\nfinancing and other\nassets), revenues and\nexpenses among the\nthree business\nsegments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of\nthese segments,\nestimates and\njudgments are made in\nallocating certain\nassets, revenues and\nexpenses. The\nallocation process is\nbased on the manner in\nwhich management\ncurrently views the\nperformance of the\nsegments. The\nallocation of common\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nand preferred stock\ndividends to each\nsegment is based on\nthe estimated amount\nof equity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the segment under\nrelevant regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nNet earnings for each\nsegment is calculated\nby applying the\nfirmwide tax rate to\neach segment\u2019s pre-tax\nearnings.

These\nactivities expose the\nfirm to many different\nindustries and\ncounterparties, and\nmay also subject the\nfirm to a\nconcentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular central\nbank, counterparty,\nborrower or issuer,\nincluding sovereign\nissuers, or to a\nparticular\nclearinghouse or\nexchange. The firm\nseeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by\nactively monitoring\nexposures and\nobtaining collateral\nfrom counterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm\nconsiders when\ndetermining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts. Netting and\ncollateral agreements\npermit the firm to\noffset receivables and\npayables with such\ncounterparties and/or\nenable the firm to\nobtain collateral on\nan upfront or\ncontingent basis.\nThe table below\npresents the credit\nconcentrations\nincluded in trading\ncash instruments and\ninvestments.\n                                              \n  $ in          As of                         \n  mill\u2026       Decemb\u2026  2022             2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S.                                        \n  gove\u2026                                       \n  and      $  205,935        $  141,1\u2026        \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  obli\u2026                                       \n  Perc\u2026                                       \n  of             14.3  %           9.6  %     \n  total                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Non-\u2026                                       \n  gove\u2026                                       \n  and      $   40,334        $  51,426        \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  obli\u2026                                       \n  Perc\u2026                                       \n  of              2.8  %           3.5  %     \n  total                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n                                              \nIn addition, the firm\nhad $ 208.53billion as\nof December 2022 and $\n222.20billion as of\nDecember 2021 of cash\ndeposits held at\ncentral banks\n(included in cash and\ncash equivalents), of\nwhich $ 165.77billion\nas of December 2022\nand $ 122.01billion as\nof December 2021 was\nheld at the Federal\nReserve.\nAs of both December\n2022 and December\n2021, the firm did not\nhave credit exposure\nto any other\ncounterparty that\nexceeded 2% of total\nassets.\nCollateral obtained by\nthe firm related to\nderivative assets is\nprincipally cash and\nis held by the firm or\na third-party\ncustodian.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nWith respect to matters described below for\nwhich management has been able to estimate a\nrange of reasonably possible loss where (i)\nactual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an\namount of money damages, (ii) the firm is\nbeing, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers\nin a securities offering and is not being\nindemnified by a party that the firm believes\nwill pay the full amount of any judgment, or\n(iii) the purchasers are demanding that the\nfirm repurchase securities, management has\nestimated the upper end of the range of\nreasonably possible loss based on (a) in the\ncase of (i), the amount of money damages\nclaimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the\ndifference between the initial sales price of\nthe securities that the firm sold in such\noffering and the estimated lowest subsequent\nprice of such securities prior to the action\nbeing commenced and (c) in the case of (iii),\nthe price that purchasers paid for the\nsecurities less the estimated value, if any,\nas of December 2022 of the relevant\nsecurities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and\n(iii), taking into account any other factors\nbelieved to be relevant to the particular\nmatter or matters of that type. As of the date\nhereof, the firm has estimated the upper end\nof the range of reasonably possible aggregate\nloss for such matters and for any other\nmatters described below where management has\nbeen able to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible aggregate loss to be approximately $\n2.3billion in excess of the aggregate reserves\nfor such matters. Management is generally\nunable to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible loss for matters other than those\nincluded in the estimate above, including\nwhere (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have\nnot claimed an amount of money damages, except\nin those instances where management can\notherwise determine an appropriate amount,\n(ii) matters are in early stages, (iii)\nmatters relate to regulatory investigations or\nreviews, except in those instances where\nmanagement can otherwise determine an\nappropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty\nas to the likelihood of a class being\ncertified or the ultimate size of the class,\n(v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of\npending appeals or motions, (vi) there are\nsignificant factual issues to be resolved,\nand/or (vii) there are novel legal issues\npresented. For example, the firm\u2019s potential\nliabilities with respect to the investigations\nand reviews described below in \u201cRegulatory\nInvestigations and Reviews and Related\nLitigation\u201d generally are not included in\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible\nloss. However, management does not believe,\nbased on currently available information, that\nthe outcomes of such other matters will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the firm\u2019s\nfinancial condition, though the outcomes could\nbe material to the firm\u2019s operating results\nfor any particular period, depending, in part,\nupon the operating results for such period.\n1MDB-Related Matters Between 2012 and 2013,\nsubsidiaries of the firm acted as arrangers or\npurchasers of approximately $ 6.5billion of\ndebt securities of 1MDB. On November 1, 2018,\nthe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed\na criminal information and guilty plea by Tim\nLeissner, a former participating managing\ndirector of the firm, and an indictment\nagainst Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing\ndirector of the firm.

Ng was charged\nwith conspiring to launder money and to\nviolate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery and internal\naccounting controls provisions. On April 8,\n2022, Ng was found guilty on all counts\nfollowing a trial. On August 18, 2020, the\nfirm announced that it entered into a\nsettlement agreement with the Government of\nMalaysia to resolve the criminal and\nregulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving\nthe firm, which includes a guarantee that the\nGovernment of Malaysia receives at least $\n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets\nseized by governmental authorities around the\nworld related to 1MDB.

In addition, GS\nMalaysia pleaded guilty to one count of\nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was\nsentenced on June 9, 2021.

The complaints generally allege\nviolations of federal antitrust laws and state\nlaws in connection with the storage of\naluminum and aluminum trading. The complaints\nseek declaratory, injunctive and other\nequitable relief, as well as unspecified\nmonetary damages, including treble damages. In\nDecember 2016, the district court granted\ndefendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and on August\n27, 2019, the Second Circuit vacated the\ndistrict court\u2019s dismissals and remanded the\ncase to district court for further\nproceedings. On July 23, 2020, the district\ncourt denied the class plaintiffs\u2019 motion for\nclass certification, and on December 16, 2020\nthe Second Circuit denied leave to appeal the\ndenial. On February 17, 2021, the district\ncourt granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary\njudgment with respect to the claims of most of\nthe individual plaintiffs. On April 14, 2021,\nthe plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. On May 31,\n2022, the two remaining individual plaintiffs\nentered into a settlement with the defendants.\nThe firm has paid the full amount of its\ncontribution to the settlement. In connection\nwith the sale of Metro, the firm agreed to\nprovide indemnities to the buyer, including\nfor any potential liabilities for legal or\nregulatory proceedings arising out of the\nconduct of Metro\u2019s business while the firm\nowned it. U.S. Treasury Securities Litigation\nGS&Co. is among the primary dealers named as\ndefendants in several putative class actions\nrelating to the market for U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, filed beginning in July 2015 and\nconsolidated in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York. GS&Co. is\nalso among the primary dealers named as\ndefendants in a similar individual action\nfiled in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York on August 25,\n2017. The consolidated class action complaint,\nfiled on December 29, 2017, generally alleges\nthat the defendants violated antitrust laws in\nconnection with an alleged conspiracy to\nmanipulate the when-issued market and auctions\nfor U.S. Treasury securities and that certain\ndefendants, including GS&Co., colluded to\npreclude trading of U.S. Treasury securities\non electronic trading platforms in order to\nimpede competition in the bidding process. The\nindividual action alleges a similar conspiracy\nregarding manipulation of the when-issued\nmarket and auctions, as well as related\nfutures and options in violation of the\nCommodity Exchange Act. The complaints seek\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, treble\ndamages in an unspecified amount and\nrestitution. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was\ngranted on March 31, 2021. On May 14, 2021,\nplaintiffs filed an amended complaint.\nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended\ncomplaint was granted on March 31, 2022.

On October\n25, 2021, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion\nto dismiss with prejudice. On November 23,\n2021, plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. On November\n10, 2022, the district court denied the\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for an indicative ruling\nthat the judgment should be vacated because\nthe wife of the district judge owned stock in\none of the defendants and the district judge\ndid not recuse himself.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K    221  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The complaint\nalso asserts a claim for unjust enrichment\nunder state common law. The complaint seeks\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, as well as\nunspecified amounts of treble and other\ndamages. On November 15, 2021, the defendants\nfiled a motion to dismiss the complaint. On\nFebruary 4, 2022, the plaintiffs filed an\namended complaint and voluntarily dismissed\nGroup Inc. from the action. On April 5, 2022,\nthe defendants filed a motion to dismiss the\namended complaint. Employment-Related Matters\nOn September 15, 2010, a putative class action\nwas filed in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York by three female\nformer employees. The complaint, as\nsubsequently amended, alleges that Group Inc.\nand GS&Co. have systematically discriminated\nagainst female employees in respect of\ncompensation, promotion and performance\nevaluations. The complaint alleges a class\nconsisting of all female employees employed at\nspecified levels in specified areas by Group\nInc. and GS&Co. since July 2002, and asserts\nclaims under federal and New York City\ndiscrimination laws. The complaint seeks class\naction status, injunctive relief and\nunspecified amounts of compensatory, punitive\nand other damages. On March 30, 2018, the\ndistrict court certified a damages class as to\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 disparate impact and treatment\nclaims. On September 4, 2018, the U.S. Court\nof Appeals for the Second Circuit denied\ndefendants\u2019 petition for interlocutory review\nof the district court\u2019s class certification\ndecision and subsequently denied defendants\u2019\npetition for rehearing. On September 27, 2018,\nplaintiffs advised the district court that\nthey would not seek to certify a class for\ninjunctive and declaratory relief. On March\n26, 2020, the Magistrate Judge in the district\ncourt granted in part a motion to compel\narbitration as to class members who are\nparties to certain agreements with Group Inc.\nand/or GS&Co. in which they agreed to\narbitrate employment-related disputes. On\nApril 16, 2020, plaintiffs submitted\nobjections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order and\ndefendants submitted conditional objections in\nthe event that the district judge overturned\nany portion of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order.\nOn July 22, 2021, defendants filed a motion to\ndecertify the class. On September 15, 2021,\nthe district court affirmed the decision of\nthe Magistrate Judge to compel arbitration. On\nMarch 17, 2022, the district court denied the\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary\njudgment as to a portion of the disparate\nimpact claim, granted in part and denied in\npart the defendants\u2019 motion for summary\njudgment as to plaintiffs\u2019 disparate impact\nand treatment claims, denied the defendants\u2019\nmotion to decertify the class, and granted in\npart and denied in part the parties\u2019\nrespective motions to preclude certain expert\ntestimony. On August 22, 2022, the district\ncourt granted in part and denied in part the\ndefendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration of the\nportion of its March 17, 2022 decision that\ndenied the defendants\u2019 motion to decertify the\nclass, denying the defendants\u2019 motion to\ndecertify the class but narrowing the class\ndefinition.

The firm\nalso provides certain\nbenefits to former or\ninactive employees\nprior to retirement.\nDefined Benefit\nPension Plans and\nPostretirement Plans\nEmployees of certain\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries\nparticipate in various\ndefined benefit\npension plans. These\nplans generally\nprovide benefits based\non years of credited\nservice and a\npercentage of eligible\ncompensation. The firm\nmaintains a defined\nbenefit pension plan\nfor certain U.K.\nemployees. As of April\n2008, the U.K. defined\nbenefit plan was\nclosed to new\nparticipants and\nfrozen for existing\nparticipants as of\nMarch 31, 2016. The\nnon-U.S. plans do not\nhave a material impact\non the firm\u2019s\nconsolidated results\nof operations. The\nfirm also maintains a\ndefined benefit\npension plan for\nsubstantially all U.S.\nemployees hired prior\nto November 1, 2003.\nAs of November 2004,\nthis plan was closed\nto new participants\nand frozen for\nexisting participants.\nIn addition, the firm\nmaintains unfunded\npostretirement benefit\nplans that provide\nmedical and life\ninsurance for eligible\nretirees and their\ndependents covered\nunder these programs.\nThese plans do not\nhave a material impact\non the firm\u2019s\nconsolidated results\nof operations. The\nfirm recognizes the\nfunded status of its\ndefined benefit\npension and\npostretirement plans,\nmeasured as the\ndifference between the\nfair value of the plan\nassets and the benefit\nobligation, in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets.As of December\n2022, other assets\nincluded $ 111million\n(related to overfunded\npension plans) and\nother liabilities\nincluded $ 337million\nrelated to these\nplans.

Share-\nbased awards that do\nnot require future\nservice (i.e., vested\nawards, including\nawards granted to\nretirement-eligible\nemployees) are\nexpensed immediately.\nShare-based awards\nthat require future\nservice are amortized\nover the relevant\nservice period.\nForfeitures are\nrecorded when they\noccur. Cash dividend\nequivalents paid on\nRSUs are generally\ncharged to retained\nearnings. If RSUs that\nrequire future service\nare forfeited, the\nrelated dividend\nequivalents originally\ncharged to retained\nearnings are\nreclassified to\ncompensation expense\nin the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The\nfirm generally issues\nnew shares of common\nstock upon delivery of\nshare-based awards. In\nlimited cases, as\noutlined in the\napplicable award\nagreements, the firm\nmay cash settle share-\nbased compensation\nawards accounted for\nas equity instruments.\nFor these awards,\nadditional paid-in\ncapital is adjusted to\nthe extent of the\ndifference between the\nvalue of the award at\nthe time of cash\nsettlement and the\ngrant-date value of\nthe award. The tax\neffect related to the\nsettlement of share-\nbased awards and\npayments of dividend\nequivalents is\nrecorded in income tax\nbenefit or expense.\nStock Incentive Plan\nThe firm sponsors a\nstock incentive plan,\nThe Goldman Sachs\nAmended and Restated\nStock Incentive Plan\n(2021) (2021 SIP),\nwhich provides for\ngrants of RSUs,\nrestricted stock,\ndividend equivalent\nrights, incentive\nstock options,\nnonqualified stock\noptions, stock\nappreciation rights,\nand other share-based\nawards, each of which\nmay be subject to\nterms and conditions,\nincluding performance\nor market conditions.\nOn April 29, 2021,\nshareholders approved\nthe 2021 SIP. The 2021\nSIP is a successor to\nseveral predecessor\nstock incentive plans,\nthe first of which was\nadopted on April 30,\n1999, and each of\nwhich was approved by\nthe firm\u2019s\nshareholders.\n\nAs of December 2022,\n60.8million shares\nwere available to be\ndelivered pursuant to\nawards granted under\nthe 2021 SIP. If any\nshares of common stock\nunderlying awards\ngranted under the 2021\nSIP or awards granted\nunder predecessor\nstock incentive plans\nare not delivered\nbecause such awards\nare forfeited,\nterminated or\ncanceled, or if shares\nof common stock\nunderlying such awards\nare surrendered or\nwithheld to satisfy\nany obligation of the\ngrantee (including\ntaxes), those shares\nwill become available\nto be delivered\npursuant to awards\ngranted under the 2021\nSIP. Shares available\nto be delivered under\nthe 2021 SIP also are\nsubject to adjustment\nfor certain events or\nchanges in corporate\nstructure as provided\nunder the 2021 SIP.\nThe 2021 SIP is\nscheduled to terminate\non the date of the\nannual meeting of\nshareholders that\noccurs in 2025.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe firm grants RSUs\n(including RSUs\nsubject to performance\nor market conditions)\nto employees, which\nare generally valued\nbased on the closing\nprice of the\nunderlying shares on\nthe date of grant,\nafter taking into\naccount a liquidity\ndiscount for any\napplicable post-\nvesting and delivery\ntransfer restrictions.\nThe value of equity\nawards also considers\nthe impact of material\nnon-public\ninformation, if any,\nthat the firm expects\nto make available\nshortly following\ngrant. RSUs generally\nvest and underlying\nshares of common stock\ndeliver (net of\nrequired withholding\ntax) as outlined in\nthe applicable award\nagreements. Award\nagreements generally\nprovide that vesting\nis accelerated in\ncertain circumstances,\nsuch as on retirement,\ndeath, disability and,\nin certain cases,\nconflicted employment.\nDelivery of the\nunderlying shares of\ncommon stock is\nconditioned on the\ngrantees satisfying\ncertain vesting and\nother requirements\noutlined in the award\nagreements. RSUs not\nsubject to performance\nor market conditions\ngenerally vest and\ndeliver over a three-\nyear period. RSUs that\nare subject to\nperformance or market\nconditions generally\ndeliver after the end\nof a three- to five-\nyearperiod.
