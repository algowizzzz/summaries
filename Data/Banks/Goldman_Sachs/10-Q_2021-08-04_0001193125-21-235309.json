The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a      \nvoting interest entity or a variable interest \nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)   \nthe total equity investment at risk is        \nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity  \nholders have the power to direct the          \nactivities of the entity that most            \nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the    \nentity and the right to receive the residual  \nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting  \ninterest entity is ownership of a majority    \nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest \nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable  \nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that    \nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a \nvoting interest entity. The firm has a        \ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when  \nthe firm has a variable interest or interests \nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct  \nthe activities of the VIE that most           \nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic       \nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb \nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive     \nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially  \nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for    \nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method \nInvestments. When the firm does not have a    \ncontrolling financial interest in an entity   \nbut can exert significant influence over the  \nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair \nvalue by electing the fair value option       \navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant        \ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns \n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstancecommon stock. In certain cases, the  \nfirm applies the equity method of accounting  \nto new investments that are strategic in      \nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s       \nprincipal business activities, when the firm  \nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or   \nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less     \nsignificant. See Note 8 for further           \ninformation about equity-method investments.  \n                                          \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    6  \n                                          \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investment Funds. The firm has    \nformed investment funds with third-party      \ninvestors. These funds are typically organized\nas limited partnerships or limited liability  \ncompanies for which the firm acts as general  \npartner or manager. Generally, the firm does  \nnot hold a majority of the economic interests \nin these funds. These funds are usually voting\ninterest entities and generally are not       \nconsolidated because third-party investors    \ntypically have rights to terminate the funds  \nor to remove the firm as general partner or   \nmanager. Investments in these funds are       \ngenerally measured at net asset value (NAV)   \nand are included in investments. See Notes 8, \n18 and 22 for further information about       \ninvestments in fund s. Use of Estimates       \nPreparation of these consolidated financial   \nstatements requires management to make certain\nestimates and assumptions, the most important \nof which relate to fair value measurements,   \nthe allowance for credit losses on loans and  \nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,    \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and provisions for losses    \nthat may arise from tax audits. These         \nestimates and assumptions are based on the    \nbest available information but actual results \ncould be materially different. Revenue        \nRecognition Financial Assets and Liabilities  \nat Fair Value. Trading assets and liabilities \nand certain investments are carried at fair   \nvalue either under the fair value option or in\naccordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, \nthe firm has elected to account for certain of\nits loans and other financial assets and      \nliabilities at fair value by electing the fair\nvalue option. The fair value of a financial   \ninstrument is the amount that would be        \nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer \na liability in an orderly transaction between \nmarket participants at the measurement date.  \nFinancial assets are marked to bid prices and \nfinancial liabilities are marked to offer     \nprices. Fair value measurements do not include\ntransaction costs. Fair value gains or losses \nare generally included in market making or    \nother principal transactions. See Note 4 for  \nfurther information about fair value          \nmeasurements. Revenue from Contracts with     \nClients. The firm recognizes revenue earned   \nfrom contracts with clients for services, such\nas investment banking, investment management, \nand execution and clearing (contracts with    \nclients), when the performance obligations    \nrelated to the underlying transaction are     \ncompleted. Revenues from contracts with       \nclients represent approximately 40% of total  \nnon-interestrevenues for both the three and   \nsix months ended June 2021 (including         \napproximately 85% of investment banking       \nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment     \nmanagement revenues and all commissions and   \nfees), and approximately 40% of total non-    \ninterestrevenues for the three months ended   \nJune 2020 and approximately 45% for the six   \nmonths ended June 2020 (including             \napproximately 85% of investment banking       \nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment     \nmanagement revenues and all commissions and   \nfees). See Note 25 for information about net  \nrevenues by business segment. Investment      \nBanking Advisory. Fees from financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues when   \nthe services related to the underlying        \ntransaction are completed under the terms of  \nthe assignment. Non-refundabledeposits and    \nmilestone payments in connection with         \nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized \nin revenues upon completion of the underlying \ntransaction or when the assignment is         \notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with \nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized \nwhen incurred and are included in transaction \nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such\nexpenses are included in investment banking   \nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon   \ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses      \nassociated with underwriting assignments are  \ngenerally deferred until the related revenue  \nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise  \nconcluded. Such expenses are included in      \ntransaction based expenses for completed      \nassignments.                                  \n                                          \n  7    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                          \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Such    \nfees are included in transaction based        \nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are  \ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or     \nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other   \nperformance target. Incentive fees are        \ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a   \nfund. Fees that are based on performance over \na twelve-month period are subject to          \nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment \nperformance over the life of the fund, future \ninvestment underperformance may require fees  \npreviously distributed to the firm to be      \nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned   \nfrom a fund or separately managed account are \nrecognized when it is probable that a         \nsignificant reversal of such fees will not    \noccur, which is generally when such fees are  \nno longer subject to fluctuations in the      \nmarket value of investments held by the fund  \nor separately managed account. Therefore,     \nincentive fees recognized during the period   \nmay relate to performance obligations         \nsatisfied in previous periods. Commissions and\nFees The firm earns commissions and fees from \nexecuting and clearing client transactions on \nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter(OTC) transactions.           \nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides \nthird-party research services to clients in   \nconnection with certain soft-dollar           \narrangements. Third-party research costs      \nincurred by the firm in connection with such  \narrangements are presented net within         \ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance   \nObligations Remaining performance obligations \nare services that the firm has committed to   \nperform in the future in connection with its  \ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining  \nperformance obligations are generally related \nto its financial advisory assignments and     \ncertain investment management activities.     \nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory    \nassignments cannot be determined until the    \noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s    \ninvestment management activities, where fees  \nare calculated based on the net asset value of\nthe fund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining       \nperformance obligations cannot be determined  \nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in   \nthe market value of investments held by the   \nfund or separately managed account. The firm  \nis able to determine the future revenues      \nassociated with management fees calculated    \nbased on committed capital. As of June 2021,  \nsubstantially all future net revenues         \nassociated with such remaining performance    \nobligations will be recognized through 2028.  \nAnnual revenues associated with such          \nperformance obligations average less than $   \n250million through 2028. Transfers of         \nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has  \nrelinquished control over the assets          \ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses   \nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or     \nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s        \ncontinuing involvement with transferred       \nfinancial assets are initially recognized at  \nfair value. For transfers of financial assets \nthat are not accounted for as sales, the      \nassets are generally included in trading      \nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a \ncollateralized financing, with the related    \ninterest expense recognized over the life of  \nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further      \ninformation about transfers of financial      \nassets accounted for as collateralized        \nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted \nfor as sales.                                 \n                                          \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    8  \n                                          \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Cash and cash equivalents    \nsegregated for regulatory and other purposes  \nwere $ 23.38billion as of June 2021 and $     \n24.52billion as of December 2020. In addition,\nthe firm segregates securities for regulatory \nand other purposes related to client activity.\nSee Note 11 for further information about     \nsegregated securities. Customer and Other     \nReceivables Customer and other receivables    \nincluded receivables from customers and       \ncounterparties of $ 104.23billion as of June  \n2021 and $ 82.39billion as of December 2020,  \nand receivables from brokers, dealers and     \nclearing organizations of $ 57.86billion as of\nJune 2021 and $ 38.94billion as of December   \n2020. Such receivables primarily consist of   \ncustomer margin loans, receivables resulting  \nfrom unsettled transactions and collateral    \nposted in connection with certain derivative  \ntransactions. Substantially all of these      \nreceivables are accounted for at amortized    \ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,  \nwhich generally approximates fair value. As   \nthese receivables are not accounted for at    \nfair value, they are not included in the      \nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through\n10. Had these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of   \nboth June 2021 and December 2020. See Note 10 \nfor further information about customer and    \nother receivables accounted for at fair value \nunder the fair value option. Interest on      \ncustomer and other receivables is recognized  \nover the life of the transaction and included \nin interest income. Customer and other        \nreceivables includes receivables from         \ncontracts with clients and contract assets.   \nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to \nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s    \nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n3.08billion as of June 2021 and $ 2.60billion \nas of December 2020. As of both June 2021 and \nDecember 2020 contract assets were not        \nmaterial. Customer and Other Payables Customer\nand other payables included payables to       \ncustomers and counterparties of $             \n217.74billion as of June 2021 and $           \n183.57billion as of December 2020, and        \npayables to brokers, dealers and clearing     \norganizations of $ 20.96billion as of June    \n2021 and $ 7.09billion as of December 2020.   \nSuch payables primarily consist of customer   \ncredit balances related to the firm\u2019s prime   \nbrokerage activities. Customer and other      \npayables are accounted for at cost plus       \naccrued interest, which generally approximates\nfair value. As these payables are not         \naccounted for at fair value, they are not     \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 through 10. Had these payables been   \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,  \nsubstantially all would have been classified  \nin level 2 as of both June 2021 and December  \n2020. Interest on customer and other payables \nis recognized over the life of the transaction\nand included in interest expense. Offsetting  \nAssets and Liabilities To reduce credit       \nexposures on derivatives and securities       \nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter    \ninto master netting agreements or similar     \narrangements (collectively, netting           \nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a      \ncontract with a counterparty that permits net \nsettlement of multiple transactions with that \ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of  \ntermination rights by a non-defaultingparty.  \nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all \ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is \ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with     \nrespect to its derivatives and securities     \nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms  \nof the related credit support agreements or   \nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit    \nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit    \nsupport agreement grants the non-             \ndefaultingparty exercising termination rights \nthe right to liquidate the collateral and     \napply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In    \norder to assess enforceability of the firm\u2019s  \nright of setoff under netting and credit      \nsupport agreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in   \nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the        \nagreement.                                    \n                                          \n  9    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                          \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and         \nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not       \nreported net of the related cash and          \nsecurities received or posted as collateral.  \nSee Note 11 for further information about     \ncollateral received and pledged, including    \nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See \nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about  \noffsetting assets and liabilities. Share-Based\nCompensation The cost of employee services    \nreceived in exchange for a share-based award  \nis generally measured based on the grant-date \nfair value of the award. Share-based awards   \nthat do not require future service (i.e.,     \nvested awards, including awards granted to    \nretirement-eligible employees) are expensed   \nimmediately. Share-based awards that require  \nfuture service are amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recorded when \nthey occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on \nrestricted stock units (RSUs) are generally   \ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that    \nrequire future service are forfeited, the     \nrelated dividend equivalents originally       \ncharged to retained earnings are reclassified \nto compensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues  \nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of   \nshare-based awards. In certain cases,         \nprimarily related to conflicted employment (as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements), \nthe firm may cash settle share-based          \ncompensation awards accounted for as equity   \ninstruments. For these awards, whose terms    \nallow for cash settlement, additional paid-   \nincapital is adjusted to the extent of the    \ndifference between the value of the award at  \nthe time of cash settlement and the grant-date\nvalue of the award. The tax effect related to \nthe settlement of share-based awards is       \nrecorded in income tax benefit or expense.    \nForeign Currency Translation Assets and       \nliabilities denominated in non-U.S.currencies \nare translated at rates of exchange prevailing\non the date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at   \naverage rates of exchange for the period.     \nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies   \nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a  \nnon-U.S.operation, when the functional        \ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are   \nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the     \nconsolidated statements of comprehensive      \nincome. Recent Accounting Developments        \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial     \nInstruments (ASC 326). In June 2016, the FASB \nissued ASU No. 2016-13,\u201cFinancial Instruments \n\u2014 Credit Losses (Topic 326) \u2014 Measurement of  \nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d This \nASU amends several aspects of the measurement \nof credit losses on certain financial         \ninstruments, including replacing the existing \nincurred credit loss model and other models   \nwith the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL)\nmodel and amending certain aspects of         \naccounting for purchased financial assets with\ndeterioration in credit quality since         \norigination. The firm adopted this ASU in     \nJanuary 2020 under a modified retrospective   \napproach. As a result of adopting this ASU,   \nthe firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses on     \nfinancial assets and commitments that are     \nmeasured at amortized cost reflects           \nmanagement\u2019s estimate of credit losses over   \nthe remaining expected life of such assets.   \nExpected credit losses for newly recognized   \nfinancial assets and commitments, as well as  \nchanges to expected credit losses during the  \nperiod, are recognized in earnings. These     \nexpected credit losses are measured based on  \nhistorical experience, current conditions and \nforecasts that affect the collectability of   \nthe reported amount. The cumulative effect of \nmeasuring the allowance under CECL as a result\nof adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020 was\nan increase in the allowance for credit losses\nof $ 848million. The increase in the allowance\nis driven by the fact that the allowance under\nCECL covers expected credit losses over the   \nfull expected life of the loan portfolios and \nalso takes into account forecasts of expected \nfuture economic conditions. In addition, in   \naccordance with the ASU, the firm elected the \nfair value option for loans that were         \npreviously accounted for as Purchased Credit  \nImpaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease  \nto the allowance for PCI loans of $           \n169million. The cumulative effect of adopting \nthis ASU was a decrease to retained earnings  \nof $ 638million (net of tax).                 \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    10  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value Measurements The fair value of a\nfinancial instrument is the amount that would \nbe received to sell an asset or paid to       \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid      \nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not  \ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures  \ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a \nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to \nmarket and/or credit risk s). The best        \nevidence of fair value is a quoted price in an\nactive market. If quoted prices in active     \nmarkets are not available, fair value is      \ndetermined by reference to prices for similar \ninstruments, quoted prices or recent          \ntransactions in less active markets, or       \ninternally developed models that primarily use\nmarket-based or independently sourced inputs, \nincluding, but not limited to, interest rates,\nvolatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign  \nexchange rates, commodity prices, credit      \nspreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread \nor difference between the interest rate at    \nwhich a borrower could finance a given        \nfinancial instrument relative to a benchmark  \ninterest rate). U.S. GAAP has a three-level   \nhierarchy for disclosure of fair value        \nmeasurements. This hierarchy prioritizes      \ninputs to the valuation techniques used to    \nmeasure fair value, giving the highest        \npriority to level 1 inputs and the lowest     \npriority to level 3 inputs. A financial       \ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based \non the lowest level of input that is          \nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In \nevaluating the significance of a valuation    \ninput, the firm considers, among other        \nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to   \nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as    \nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical, \nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.  \nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are       \nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values \nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial \nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain  \nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and      \nliabilities may require valuation adjustments \nthat a market participant would require to    \narrive at fair value for factors, such as     \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,   \nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments  \nare generally based on market evidence. The   \nvaluation techniques and nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair value of the\nfirm\u2019s financial instruments are described    \nbelow. See Notes 5 through 10 for further     \ninformation about significant unobservable    \ninputs used to value level 3 financial        \ninstruments.                                  \n                                           \n  11    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These instruments are valued \nusing quoted prices for identical unrestricted\ninstruments in active markets. The firm       \ndefines active markets for equity instruments \nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market  \ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm   \ndefines active markets for debt instruments   \nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity. \nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain  \nnon-U.S.government obligations, most agency   \nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and   \nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,  \nmost state and municipal obligations, most    \nmoney market instruments, most other debt     \nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed \nequities, certain private equities,           \ncommodities and certain lending commitments.  \nValuations of level 2 instruments can be      \nverified to quoted prices, recent trading     \nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative    \npricing sources with reasonable levels of     \nprice transparency. Consideration is given to \nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor firm) and the relationship of recent market\nactivity to the prices provided from          \nalternative pricing sources. Valuation        \nadjustments are typically made to level 2     \ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject  \nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair   \nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally    \nbased on market evidence. Level 3.

Interest    \n       rate swaps and options denominated in  \n       the currencies of leading              \n       industrialized nations are             \n  \u2022    characterized by high trading volumes  \n       and tight bid/offer spreads.

Credit default   \n       swaps that reference indices, large    \n       corporates and major sovereigns        \n       generally exhibit the most price       \n       transparency. For credit default       \n       swaps with other underliers, price     \n       transparency varies based on credit    \n       rating, the cost of borrowing the      \n       underlying reference obligations, and  \n  \u2022    the availability of the underlying     \n       reference obligations for delivery     \n       upon the default of the issuer.        \n       Credit default swaps that reference    \n       loans, asset-backed securities and     \n       emerging market debt instruments tend  \n       to have less price transparency than   \n       those that reference corporate bonds.  \n       In addition, more complex credit       \n       derivatives, such as those sensitive   \n       to the correlation between two or      \n       more underlying reference              \n       obligations, generally have less       \n       price transparency.                    \n                                              \n                                           \n  13    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Price transparency      \n       varies based on the underlying         \n  \u2022    commodity, delivery location, tenor    \n       and product quality (e.g., diesel      \n       fuel compared to unleaded gasoline).   \n       In general, price transparency for     \n       commodity derivatives is greater for   \n       contracts with shorter tenors and      \n       contracts that are more closely        \n       aligned with major and/or benchmark    \n       commodity indices.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Equity.Price transparency for equity   \n       derivatives varies by market and       \n       underlier. Options on indices and the  \n       common stock of corporates included    \n       in major equity indices exhibit the    \n       most price transparency.

In addition,    \n  \u2022    the valuation of certain structured    \n       trades requires the use of level\u00a03     \n       correlation inputs, such as the        \n       correlation of the price performance   \n       of two or more individual stocks or    \n       the correlation of the price           \n       performance for a basket of stocks to  \n       another asset class, such as           \n       commodities.                           \n                                              \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    14  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Subsequent to the initial         \nvaluation of a level 3 derivative, the firm   \nupdates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to     \nreflect observable market changes and any     \nresulting gains and losses are classified in  \nlevel 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when      \ncorroborated by evidence, such as similar     \nmarket transactions, third-party pricing      \nservices and/or broker or dealer quotations or\nother empirical market data. In circumstances \nwhere the firm cannot verify the model value  \nby reference to market transactions, it is    \npossible that a different valuation model     \ncould produce a materially different estimate \nof fair value. See Note 7 for further         \ninformation about significant unobservable    \ninputs used in the valuation of level 3       \nderivatives. Valuation Adjustments. Valuation \nadjustments are integral to determining the   \nfair value of derivative portfolios and are   \nused to adjust the mid-marketvaluations       \nproduced by derivative pricing models to the  \nexit price valuation. These adjustments       \nincorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of    \nliquidity, and credit and funding valuation   \nadjustments, which account for the credit and \nfunding risk inherent in the uncollateralized \nportion of derivative portfolios. The firm    \nalso makes funding valuation adjustments to   \ncollateralized derivatives where the terms of \nthe agreement do not permit the firm to       \ndeliver or repledge collateral received.      \nMarket-based inputs are generally used when   \ncalibrating valuation adjustments to market-  \nclearing levels. In addition, for derivatives \nthat include significant unobservable inputs, \nthe firm makes model or exit price adjustments\nto account for the valuation uncertainty      \npresent in the transaction. Valuation         \nTechniques and Significant Inputs for Other   \nFinancial Instruments at Fair Value In        \naddition to trading cash instruments,         \nderivatives, and certain investments and      \nloans, the firm accounts for certain of its   \nother financial assets and liabilities at fair\nvalue under the fair value option. Such       \ninstruments include resale and repurchase     \nagreements; certain securities borrowed and   \nloaned transactions; certain customer and     \nother receivables, including certain margin   \nloans; certain time deposits, including       \nstructured certificates of deposit, which are \nhybrid financial instruments; substantially   \nall other secured financings, including       \ntransfers of assets accounted for as          \nfinancings; certain unsecured short- and long-\nterm borrowings, substantially all of which   \nare hybrid financial instruments; and certain \nother liabilities. These instruments are      \ngenerally valued based on discounted cash flow\ntechniques, which incorporate inputs with     \nreasonable levels of price transparency, and  \nare generally classified in level 2 because   \nthe inputs are observable. Valuation          \nadjustments may be made for liquidity and for \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality.   \nThe significant inputs used to value the      \nfirm\u2019s other financial instruments are        \ndescribed below. Resale and Repurchase        \nAgreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of    \nresale and repurchase agreements and          \nsecurities borrowed and loaned are funding    \nspreads, the amount and timing of expected    \nfuture cash flows and interest rates. Customer\nand Other Receivables. The significant inputs \nto the valuation of receivables are interest  \nrates, the amount and timing of expected      \nfuture cash flows and funding spreads.        \nDeposits. The significant inputs to the       \nvaluation of time deposits are interest rates \nand the amount and timing of future cash      \nflows. The inputs used to value the embedded  \nderivative component of hybrid financial      \ninstruments are consistent with the inputs    \nused to value the firm\u2019s other derivative     \ninstruments described above. See Note 7 for   \nfurther information about derivatives and Note\n13 for further information about deposits.    \nOther Secured Financings. The significant     \ninputs to the valuation of other secured      \nfinancings are the amount and timing of       \nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,   \nfunding spreads and the fair value of the     \ncollateral delivered by the firm (determined  \nusing the amount and timing of expected future\ncash flows, market prices, market yields and  \nrecovery assumptions). See Note 11 for further\ninformation about other secured financings.   \nUnsecured Short- and Long-Term Borrowings. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of        \nunsecured short- and long-term borrowings are \nthe amount and timing of expected future cash \nflows, interest rates, the credit spreads of  \nthe firm and commodity prices for prepaid     \ncommodity transactions. The inputs used to    \nvalue the embedded derivative component of    \nhybrid financial instruments are consistent   \nwith the inputs used to value the firm\u2019s other\nderivative instruments described above. See   \nNote 7 for further information about          \nderivatives and Note 14 for further           \ninformation about borrowings. Other           \nLiabilities. The significant inputs to the    \nvaluation of other liabilities are the amount \nand timing of expected future cash flows and  \nequity volatility and correlation inputs. The \ninputs used to value the embedded derivative  \ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are \nconsistent with the inputs used to value the  \nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described \nabove.

For example,  \n       the highest recovery rate for          \n       corporate debt instruments is          \n  \u2022    appropriate for valuing a specific     \n       corporate debt instrument, but may     \n       not be appropriate for valuing any     \n       other corporate debt instrument.       \n       Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do   \n       not represent uncertainty in, or       \n       possible ranges of, fair value         \n       measurements of level\u00a03 trading cash   \n       instruments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increases in yield, duration or        \n       cumulative loss rate used in the       \n       valuation of level\u00a03 trading cash      \n       instruments would have resulted in a   \n       lower fair value measurement, while    \n       increases in recovery rate would have  \n  \u2022    resulted in a higher fair value        \n       measurement as of both June\u00a02021 and   \n       December\u00a02020. Due to the distinctive  \n       nature of each level\u00a03 trading cash    \n       instrument, the interrelationship of   \n       inputs is not necessarily uniform      \n       within each product type.              \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Trading cash instruments are valued    \n       using discounted cash flows.           \n                                              \nLevel 3 Rollforward                           \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level 3\ntrading cash\ninstruments.\n                                              \n           T\u2026                S\u2026               \n           M\u2026                M\u2026               \n           E\u2026                E\u2026               \n           J\u2026                J\u2026               \n  $                                           \n  \u2026        2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026     \n  \u2026                                           \n     T\u2026                                       \n     t\u2026                                       \n     c\u2026                                       \n     i\u2026                                       \n     a\u2026                                       \n  \u2026        $\u2026       $\u2026       $\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        23       17       42        68     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        10       (\u2026  )    16       (1\u2026  )  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        2\u2026       3\u2026       6\u2026       609     \n  \u2026        (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (3\u2026  )  \n  \u2026        (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        1\u2026       6\u2026       1\u2026       761     \n  \u2026                                           \n  3                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )  \n  \u2026                                           \n  3                                           \n  \u2026        $\u2026       $\u2026       $\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                           \n     T\u2026                                       \n     t\u2026                                       \n     c\u2026                                       \n     i\u2026                                       \n     l\u2026                                       \n  \u2026        $\u2026  )        )    $\u2026  )         )  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026         2       (1  )     4         \u2013     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        (2  )    15        \u2013       105     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        35       21       28        40     \n  \u2026        (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (\u2026  )    (22  )  \n  \u2026        20        5       10         1     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        (5  )    (8  )    (4  )    (10  )  \n  \u2026                                           \n  3                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026         5       21        3         3     \n  \u2026                                           \n  3                                           \n  \u2026        $\u2026  )        )    $\u2026  )         )  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       Changes in fair value are presented    \n  \u2022    for all trading cash instruments that  \n       are classified in level\u00a03 as of the    \n       end of the period.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates  \n  \u2022    to trading cash instruments that were  \n       still held atperiod-end.               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Transfers between levels of the fair   \n       value hierarchy are reported at the    \n       beginning of the reporting period in   \n  \u2022    which they occur.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities    \nDerivative Activities Derivatives are         \ninstruments that derive their value from      \nunderlying asset prices, indices, reference   \nrates and other inputs, or a combination of   \nthese factors. Derivatives may be traded on an\nexchange (exchange-traded) or they may be     \nprivately negotiated contracts, which are     \nusually referred to as OTC derivatives.       \nCertain of the firm\u2019s OTC derivatives are     \ncleared and settled through central clearing  \ncounterparties (OTC-cleared),while others are \nbilateral contracts between two counterparties\n(bilateral OTC). Market Making. As a market   \nmaker, the firm enters into derivative        \ntransactions to provide liquidity to clients  \nand to facilitate the transfer and hedging of \ntheir risks. In this role, the firm typically \nacts as principal and is required to commit   \ncapital to provide execution, and maintains   \nmarket-making positions in response to, or in \nanticipation of, client demand.               \nRisk Management. The\nfirm also enters into\nderivatives to actively\nmanage risk exposures\nthat arise from its\nmarket-making and\ninvesting and financing\nactivities. The firm\u2019s\nholdings and exposures\nare hedged, in many\ncases, on either a\nportfolio or risk-\nspecific basis, as\nopposed to an\ninstrument-by-\ninstrumentbasis. The\noffsetting impact of\nthis economic hedging\nis reflected in the\nsame business segment\nas the related\nrevenues. In addition,\nthe firm may enter into\nderivatives designated\nas hedges under U.S.\nGAAP. These derivatives\nare used to manage\ninterest rate exposure\nof certain fixed-rate\nunsecured borrowings\nand deposits, foreign\nexchange risk of\ncertain available-for-\nsalesecurities and the\nnet investment in\ncertain\nnon-U.S.operations, and\nthe price risk of\ncertain commodities.\n\nThe firm enters into\nvarious types of\nderivatives, including:\n                                              \n       Futures and Forwards.Contracts that    \n       commit counterparties to purchase or   \n  \u2022    sell financial instruments,            \n       commodities or currencies in the       \n       future.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Swaps.Contracts that require           \n       counterparties to exchange cash        \n       flows, such as currency or interest    \n       payment streams. The amounts           \n  \u2022    exchanged are based on the specific    \n       terms of the contract with reference   \n       to specified rates, financial          \n       instruments, commodities, currencies   \n       or indices.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Options.Contracts in which the option  \n       purchaser has the right, but not the   \n       obligation, to purchase from or sell   \n  \u2022    to the option writer financial         \n       instruments, commodities or            \n       currencies within a defined time       \n       period for a specified price.          \n                                              \nDerivatives are\nreported on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for\nderivative assets and\nliabilities for a given\ncounterparty) when a\nlegal right of setoff\nexists under an\nenforceable netting\nagreement (counterparty\nnetting). Derivatives\nare accounted for at\nfair value, net of cash\ncollateral received or\nposted under\nenforceable credit\nsupport agreements\n(cash collateral\nnetting).

For example,     \n  \u2022    option pricing models and discounted   \n       cash flow\u00a0models are typically used    \n       together to determine fair value.      \n       Therefore, the level\u00a03 balance         \n       encompasses both of these techniques.  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Correlation within currencies and      \n  \u2022    equities includes cross-product type   \n       correlation.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Natural gas spread represents the      \n  \u2022    spread per million British thermal     \n       units of natural gas.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Oil spread represents the spread per   \n       barrel of oil and refined products.    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Electricity price represents the       \n  \u2022    price per megawatt hour of             \n       electricity.                           \n                                              \nRange of Significant                          \nUnobservable Inputs                           \nThe following provides\ninformation about the\nranges of significant\nunobservable inputs\nused to value the\nfirm\u2019s level 3\nderivative\ninstruments:\n                                              \n       Correlation.Ranges for correlation     \n       cover a variety of underliers both     \n       within one product type (e.g., equity  \n       index and equity single stock names)   \n       and across product types (e.g.,        \n       correlation of an interest rate and a  \n  \u2022    currency), as well as across regions.  \n       Generally, cross-product type          \n       correlation inputs are used to value   \n       more complex instruments and are       \n       lower than correlation inputs on       \n       assets within the same derivative      \n       product type.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Volatility.Ranges for volatility       \n       cover numerous underliers across a     \n       variety of markets, maturities and     \n  \u2022    strike prices.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) The net unrealized losses on level\n3 derivatives for the three months ended June \n2021 were primarily attributable to losses on \ncertain equity derivatives (primarily         \nreflecting the impact of an increase in equity\nprices) and losses on certain currency        \nderivatives (primarily reflecting the impact  \nof changes in foreign exchange rates),        \npartially offset by gains on certain commodity\nderivatives (primarily reflecting the impact  \nof an increase in commodity prices). Transfers\ninto level 3 derivatives during the three     \nmonths ended June 2021 primarily reflected    \ntransfers of certain equity derivative        \nliabilities from level 2 (principally due to  \nreduced transparency of certain volatility    \ninputs used to value these derivatives) and   \ntransfers of certain credit derivative        \nliabilities from level 2 (principally due to  \ncertain unobservable credit spread inputs     \nbecoming significant to the valuation of these\nderivatives). Transfers out of level 3        \nderivatives during the three months ended June\n2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain \nequity derivative liabilities to level 2      \n(principally due to increased transparency of \ncertain volatility inputs used to value these \nderivatives).

The net         \nunrealized losses on level 3 derivatives for  \nthe six months ended June 2021 were primarily \nattributable to losses on certain equity      \nderivatives (primarily reflecting the impact  \nof an increase in equity prices), partially   \noffset by gains on certain commodity          \nderivatives (primarily reflecting the impact  \nof an increase in commodity prices).

The drivers of  \nthe net unrealized losses on level 3          \nderivatives for the three months ended June   \n2020 were primarily attributable to losses on \ncertain credit derivatives (primarily         \nreflecting the tightening of certain credit   \nspreads), partially offset by gains on certain\nequity derivatives (primarily reflecting      \nchanges in underlying equity prices). The     \ndrivers of both transfers into level 3        \nderivatives and transfers out of level 3      \nderivatives during the three months ended June\n2020 were not material. Six Months Ended June \n2020. The net realized and unrealized gains on\nlevel 3 derivatives of $ 2.25billion          \n(reflecting $ 136million of net realized gains\nand $ 2.11billion of net unrealized gains) for\nthe six months ended June 2020 included       \ngains/(losses) of $ 2.29billion reported in   \nmarket making and $( 45) million reported in  \nother principal transactions. The net         \nunrealized gains on level 3 derivatives for   \nthe six months ended June 2020 were primarily \nattributable to gains on certain equity       \nderivatives (primarily reflecting the impact  \nof a decrease in underlying equity prices) and\ngains on certain credit derivatives (primarily\nreflecting the impact of a decrease in        \ninterest rates). The drivers of both transfers\ninto level 3 derivatives and transfers out of \nlevel 3 derivatives during the six months     \nended June 2020 were not material.            \n                                           \n  25    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

If a   \n       credit event occurs, the seller of     \n       protection is required to make a       \n       payment to the buyer, calculated       \n       according to the terms of the          \n       contract.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit Options.In a credit option,     \n       the option writer assumes the          \n       obligation to purchase or sell a       \n       reference obligation at a specified    \n       price or credit spread. The option     \n       purchaser buys the right, but does     \n  \u2022    not assume the obligation, to sell     \n       the reference obligation to, or        \n       purchase it from, the option writer.   \n       The payments on credit options depend  \n       either on a particular credit spread   \n       or the price of the reference          \n       obligation.                            \n                                              \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    26  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited)                                   \n                                              \n       Credit Indices, Baskets and            \n       Tranches.Credit derivatives may        \n       reference a basket of single-name      \n       credit default swaps or a broad-based  \n       index. If a credit event occurs in     \n       one of the underlying reference        \n       obligations, the protection seller     \n       pays the protection buyer. The         \n       payment is typically apro-rataportion  \n       of the transaction\u2019s total notional    \n  \u2022    amount based on the underlying         \n       defaulted reference obligation. In     \n       certain transactions, the credit risk  \n       of a basket or index is separated      \n       into various portions (tranches),      \n       each having different levels of        \n       subordination. The most junior         \n       tranches cover initial defaults and    \n       once losses exceed the notional        \n       amount of these junior tranches, any   \n       excess loss is covered by the next     \n       most senior tranche.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Total Return Swaps.A total return      \n       swap transfers the risks relating to   \n       economic performance of a reference    \n       obligation from the protection buyer   \n       to the protection seller. Typically,   \n       the protection buyer receives a        \n  \u2022    floating rate of interest and          \n       protection against any reduction in    \n       fair value of the reference            \n       obligation, and the protection seller  \n       receives the cash flows associated     \n       with the reference obligation, plus    \n       any increase in the fair value of the  \n       reference obligation.                  \n                                              \nThe firm economically\nhedges its exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds.

An\ninterest rate swap is\nconsidered highly\neffective in offsetting\nchanges in fair value\nattributable to changes\nin the hedged risk when\nthe regression analysis\nresults in a\ncoefficient of\ndetermination of 80% or\ngreater and a slope\nbetween 80% and 125%.\n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    28  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Changes in\nspot rates of such\ncommodities are\nreflected as an\nadjustment to their\ncarrying value, and the\nrelated gains/(losses)\non both the commodities\nand the designated\nfutures contracts are\nincluded in market\nmaking. The contractual\nforward points on the\ndesignated futures\ncontracts are amortized\ninto earnings ratably\nover the life of the\ncontract and other\ngains/(losses) as a\nresult of changes in\nthe forward points are\nincluded in other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss). The\ncumulative hedging\nadjustment was not\nmaterial as of June\n2021 and the related\ngains/(losses) were not\nmaterial for the three\nmonths ended June 2021.\nNet Investment Hedges                         \nThe firm seeks to\nreduce the impact of\nfluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates on its\nnet investments in\ncertain non-U.S.\noperations through the\nuse of foreign currency\nforward contracts and\nforeign currency-\ndenominated debt. For\nforeign currency\nforward contracts\ndesignated as hedges,\nthe effectiveness of\nthe hedge is assessed\nbased on the overall\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of the forward\ncontracts (i.e., based\non changes in forward\nrates). For foreign\ncurrency-denominated\ndebt designated as a\nhedge, the\neffectiveness of the\nhedge is assessed based\non changes in spot\nrates. For qualifying\nnet investment hedges,\nall gains or losses on\nthe hedging instruments\nare included in\ncurrency translation.\n\nThe table below\npresents the\ngains/(losses) from net\ninvestment hedging.\n                                              \n         Thr\u2026                  Six            \n         Mon\u2026                 Mon\u2026            \n         End\u2026                 End\u2026            \n         June                 June            \n  $                                           \n  in\u00a0    2021       20\u2026       2021    20\u2026     \n  mi\u2026                                         \n  He\u2026                                         \n  Fo\u2026                                         \n  cu\u2026    $(2\u2026  )    $(\u2026  )    $227    $6\u2026     \n  fo\u2026                                         \n  co\u2026                                         \n  Fo\u2026       $         $                       \n  cu\u2026      (6  )     (9  )    $259         )  \n  de\u2026                                         \n                                              \n                                           \n  29    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investments in Funds at Net Asset \nValue Per Share. Equity securities and debt   \ninstruments, at fair value include investments\nin funds that are measured at NAV of the      \ninvestment fund. The firm uses NAV to measure \nthe fair value of fund investments when (i)   \nthe fund investment does not have a readily   \ndeterminable fair value and (ii) the NAV of   \nthe investment fund is calculated in a manner \nconsistent with the measurement principles of \ninvestment company accounting, including      \nmeasurement of the investments at fair value. \nSubstantially all of the firm\u2019s investments in\nfunds at NAV consist of investments in firm-  \nsponsored private equity, credit, real estate \nand hedge funds where the firm co-investswith \nthird-party investors. Private equity funds   \nprimarily invest in a broad range of          \nindustries worldwide, including leveraged     \nbuyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments\nand distressed investments. Credit funds      \ngenerally invest in loans and other fixed     \nincome instruments and are focused on         \nproviding private high-yield capital for      \nleveraged and management buyout transactions, \nrecapitalizations, financings, refinancings,  \nacquisitions and restructurings for private   \nequity firms, private family companies and    \ncorporate issuers. Real estate funds invest   \nglobally, primarily in real estate companies, \nloan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and   \nproperty. Private equity, credit and real     \nestate funds are closed-endfunds in which the \nfirm\u2019s investments are generally not eligible \nfor redemption. Distributions will be received\nfrom these funds as the underlying assets are \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. The firm also invests in hedge  \nfunds, primarily multi-disciplinary hedge     \nfunds that employ a fundamental bottom-up     \ninvestment approach across various asset      \nclasses and strategies. The firm\u2019s investments\nin hedge funds primarily include interests    \nwhere the underlying assets are illiquid in   \nnature, and proceeds from redemptions will not\nbe received until the underlying assets are   \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain.                                 \nPrivate equity and\nhedge funds described\nabove are primarily\n\u201ccovered funds\u201d as\ndefined in the Volcker\nRule of the U.S. Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act (Dodd-\nFrank Act).\nSubstantially all of\nthe credit and real\nestate funds described\nabove are not covered\nfunds. The Board of\nGovernors of the\nFederal Reserve System\n(FRB) extended the\nconformance period to\nJuly 2022 for the\nfirm\u2019s investments in,\nand relationships with,\ncertain legacy\n\u201cilliquid funds\u201d (as\ndefined in the Volcker\nRule) that were in\nplace prior to December\n2013. This extension is\napplicable to\nsubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s remaining\ninvestments in, and\nrelationships with,\nsuch covered funds. As\nof June 2021, the\nfirm\u2019s total\ninvestments in funds at\nNAV of $ 3.99billion\nincluded$ 1.65 billion\nof investments that\nwere in covered funds.\n\nThe firm expects to\nachieve compliance for\nthese covered funds\nthrough ongoing\nharvesting of\nunderlying fund\ninvestments in the\nordinary course or\nthrough structural\nmodifications to these\nfunds. To the extent\nthat the firm is not\nable to achieve\ncompliance through\nthese measures, the\nfirm will be required\nto sell its interests\nin such funds by July\n2022. If that occurs,\nthe firm may receive a\nvalue for its interests\nthat is less than the\nthen carrying value as\nthere could be a\nlimited secondary\nmarket for these\ninvestments and the\nfirm may be unable to\nsell them in orderly\ntransactions.\nThe table below\npresents the fair value\nof investments in funds\nat NAV and the related\nunfunded commitments.\n                                              \n  $ in\u00a0            Fair\u00a0Value       Unfunded  \n  millions                 of    Commitments  \n                  Investments                 \n  As of June\u00a0                                 \n  2021                                        \n  Private                                  $  \n  equity               $2,137            625  \n  funds                                       \n  Credit                1,490            685  \n  funds                                       \n  Hedge funds              83              \u2013  \n  Real estate             278            206  \n  funds                                       \n  Total                $3,988         $1,516  \n  As of                                       \n  December\u00a0                                   \n  2020                                        \n  Private                                     \n  equity               $2,042                 \n  funds                                       \n  Credit                1,312            680  \n  funds                                       \n  Hedge funds             102              \u2013  \n  Real estate             208            213  \n  funds                                       \n  Total                $3,664         $1,450  \n                                              \n                                           \n  31    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

calculating the fair value of any one  \n       investment. For example, the highest   \n       multiple for private equity            \n  \u2022    securities is appropriate for valuing  \n       a specific private equity security     \n       but may not be appropriate for         \n       valuing any other private equity       \n       security. Accordingly, the ranges of   \n       inputs do not represent uncertainty    \n       in, or possible ranges of, fair value  \n       measurements of level\u00a03 investments.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increases in yield, discount rate,     \n       capitalization rate or duration used   \n       in the valuation of level\u00a03            \n       investments would have resulted in a   \n       lower fair value measurement, while    \n       increases in recovery rate or          \n  \u2022    multiples would have resulted in a     \n       higher fair value measurement as of    \n       both June\u00a02021 and December\u00a02020. Due  \n       to the distinctive nature of each      \n       level\u00a03 investment, the                \n       interrelationship of inputs is not     \n       necessarily uniform within each        \n       product type.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Corporate debt securities, securities  \n       backed by real estate and other debt   \n       obligations are valued using           \n  \u2022    discounted cash flows, and equity      \n       securities are valued using market     \n       comparables and discounted cash        \n       flows.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       The fair value of any one instrument   \n       may be determined using multiple       \n       valuation techniques. For example,     \n  \u2022    market comparables and discounted      \n       cash flows may be used together to     \n       determine fair value. Therefore, the   \n       level\u00a03 balance encompasses both of    \n       these techniques.                      \n                                              \nLevel 3 Rollforward                           \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level 3\ninvestments.\n                                              \n        Th\u2026                 Six               \n        Mo\u2026                 Mo\u2026               \n        En\u2026                 En\u2026               \n        Ju\u2026                 Ju\u2026               \n  $                                           \n  in    20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026     \n  m\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026    $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026     85        40       245       121     \n  g\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  u\u2026    1,\u2026       (1\u2026  )    1,\u2026       (1\u2026  )  \n  g\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    558       344       971       811     \n  S\u2026    (4\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (7\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )  \n  S\u2026    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (5\u2026  )  \n  T\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026    873       428       1,\u2026       5,\u2026     \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  T\u2026                                          \n  o\u2026                                          \n  of    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (2\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )  \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  E\u2026    $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       Changes in fair value are presented    \n  \u2022    for all investments that are           \n       classified in level\u00a03 as of the end    \n       of the period.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates  \n  \u2022    to investments that were still held    \n       atperiod-end.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Transfers between levels of the fair   \n       value hierarchy are reported at the    \n       beginning of the reporting period in   \n  \u2022    which they occur.

To determine the \nallowance for credit losses, the firm         \nclassifies its loans and lending commitments  \naccounted for at amortized cost into wholesale\nand consumer portfolios. These portfolios     \nrepresent the level at which the firm has     \ndeveloped and documented its methodology to   \ndetermine the allowance for credit losses. The\nallowance for credit losses is measured on a  \ncollective basis for loans that exhibit       \nsimilar risk characteristics using a modeled  \napproach and asset-specific basis for loans   \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics. The allowance for credit     \nlosses takes into account the weighted average\nof a range of forecasts of future economic    \nconditions over the expected life of the loan \nand lending commitments. The expected life of \neach loan or lending commitment is determined \nbased on the contractual term adjusted for    \nextension options or demand features. The     \nforecasts include baseline, favorable and     \nadverse economic scenarios over a three-year  \nperiod. For loans with expected lives beyond  \nthree years, the model reverts to historical  \nloss information based on a non-linearmodeled \napproach. The forecasted economic scenarios   \nconsider a number of risk factors relevant to \nthe wholesale and consumer portfolios         \ndescribed below. The firm applies judgment in \nweighing individual scenarios each quarter    \nbased on a variety of factors, including the  \nfirm\u2019s internally derived economic outlook,   \nmarket consensus, recent macroeconomic        \nconditions and industry trends.

The allowance   \nfor credit losses for wholesale loans and     \nlending commitments that exhibit similar risk \ncharacteristics is measured using a modeled   \napproach. These models determine the          \nprobability of default and loss given default \nbased on various risk factors, including      \ninternal credit ratings, industry default and \nloss data, expected life, macroeconomic       \nindicators, the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet   \nits financial obligations, the borrower\u2019s     \ncountry of risk and industry, loan seniority  \nand collateral type. For lending commitments, \nthe methodology also considers probability of \ndrawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans  \nbacked by real estate, risk factors include   \nthe loan-to-valueratio, debt service ratio and\nhome price index. The most significant inputs \nto the forecast model for wholesale loans and \nlending commitments include unemployment      \nrates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and    \nindustrial delinquency rates, short- and long-\nterm interest rates, and oil prices. The      \nallowance for loan losses for wholesale loans \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics, such as nonaccrual loans or  \nloans in a troubled debt restructuring, is    \ncalculated using the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s    \noriginal effective rate, the observable market\nprice of the loan or the fair value of the    \ncollateral. Wholesale loans are charged-      \noffagainst the allowance for loan losses when \ndeemed to be uncollectible. Consumer. The     \nallowance for credit losses for consumer loans\nthat exhibit similar risk characteristics is  \ncalculated using a modeled approach which     \nclassifies consumer loans into pools based on \nborrower-related and exposure-related         \ncharacteristics that differentiate a pool\u2019s   \nrisk characteristics from other pools. The    \nfactors considered in determining a pool are  \ngenerally consistent with the risk            \ncharacteristics used for internal credit risk \nmeasurement and management and include key    \nmetrics, such as FICO credit scores,          \ndelinquency status, loan vintage and          \nmacroeconomic indicators. The most significant\ninputs to the forecast model for consumer     \nloans include unemployment rates and          \ndelinquency rates. The expected life of       \nrevolving credit card loans is determined by  \nmodeling expected future draws and the timing \nand amount of repayments allocated to the     \nfunded balance. The firm also recognizes an   \nallowance for credit losses on commitments to \nacquire loans. However, no allowance for      \ncredit losses is recognized on credit card    \nlending commitments as they are cancellable by\nthe firm. The allowance for credit losses for \nconsumer loans that do not share similar risk \ncharacteristics, such as loans in a troubled  \ndebt restructuring, is calculated using the   \npresent value of expected future cash flows   \ndiscounted at the loan\u2019s original effective   \nrate.                                         \n                                           \n  41    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

In addition, the provision for    \ncredit losses for wholesale loans was impacted\nby ratings downgrades and asset-specific      \nprovisions primarily related to borrowers in  \nthe technology, media & telecommunications,   \ndiversified industrials, and oil and gas      \nindustries. Besides the weaker economic       \noutlook related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the \nprovision for credit losses for consumer loans\nfor the six months ended June 2020 was also   \nimpacted by the continued seasoning of the    \ncredit card portfolio. Net (charge-           \noffs)/recoveries for the six months ended June\n2020 for wholesale loans were substantially   \nall related to corporate loans and net        \n(charge-offs)/recoveries for consumer loans   \nwere primarily related to installment loans.  \n                                           \n  43    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Due  \n       to the distinctive nature of each      \n       level\u00a03 loan, the interrelationship    \n       of inputs is not necessarily uniform   \n       within each product type.              \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Loans are valued using discounted      \n       cash flows.                            \n                                              \nLevel 3 Rollforward                           \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level 3\nloans.\n                                              \n        Th\u2026                 Six               \n        Mo\u2026                 Mo\u2026               \n        En\u2026                 En\u2026               \n        Ju\u2026                 Ju\u2026               \n  $                                           \n  in    20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026     \n  m\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026    $2\u2026       $2\u2026       $2\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026     21        16        47        37     \n  g\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  u\u2026     22        10       (11  )    (53  )  \n  g\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026     35        58        68       397     \n  S\u2026      \u2013         \u2013         \u2013        (7  )  \n  S\u2026    (2\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (3\u2026  )    (3\u2026  )  \n  T\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026     51       163        94       787     \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  T\u2026                                          \n  o\u2026                                          \n  of    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (2\u2026  )    (13  )  \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  E\u2026    $2\u2026       $2\u2026       $2\u2026       $2\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       Changes in fair value are presented    \n  \u2022    for loans that are classified in       \n       level\u00a03 as of the end of the period.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates  \n  \u2022    to loans that were still held          \n       atperiod-end.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Purchases includes originations and    \n       secondary purchases.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Transfers between levels of the fair   \n       value hierarchy are reported at the    \n       beginning of the reporting period in   \n  \u2022    which they occur.

The firm\ngenerally calculates\nthe fair value of\nloans and lending\ncommitments for which\nthe fair value option\nis elected by\ndiscounting future\ncash flows at a rate\nwhich incorporates the\ninstrument-specific\ncredit spreads. For\nfloating-rate loans\nand lending\ncommitments,\nsubstantially all\nchanges in fair value\nare attributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads, whereas for\nfixed-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nchanges in fair value\nare also attributable\nto changes in interest\nrates.\nNote 11. Collateralized Agreements and        \nFinancings Collateralized agreements are      \nresale agreements and securities borrowed.    \nCollateralized financings are repurchase      \nagreements, securities loaned and other       \nsecured financings. The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things, \nfacilitate client activities, invest excess   \ncash, acquire securities to cover short       \npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings are  \npresented on a net-by-counterpartybasis when a\nlegal right of setoff exists. Interest on     \ncollateralized agreements, which is included  \nin interest income, and collateralized        \nfinancings, which is included in interest     \nexpense, is recognized over the life of the   \ntransaction.See Note 23 for further           \ninformation about interest income and interest\nexpense. Resale and Repurchase Agreements A   \nresale agreement is a transaction in which the\nfirm purchases financial instruments from a   \nseller, typically in exchange for cash, and   \nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to    \nresell the same or substantially the same     \nfinancial instruments to the seller at a      \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. A repurchase agreement is a transaction \nin which the firm sells financial instruments \nto a buyer, typically in exchange for cash,   \nand simultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same \nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a     \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale       \nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d)involve the legal transfer of       \nownership of financial instruments, they are  \naccounted for as financing arrangements       \nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the  \nmaturity of the agreement. The financial      \ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and   \nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.  \ngovernment and agency, and investment-grade   \nsovereign obligations. The firm receives      \nfinancial instruments purchased under resale  \nagreements and makes delivery of financial    \ninstruments sold under repurchase agreements. \nTo mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these financial           \ninstruments on a daily basis, and delivers or \nobtains additional collateral due to changes  \nin the market value of the financial          \ninstruments, as appropriate. For resale       \nagreements, the firm typically requires       \ncollateral with a fair value approximately    \nequal to the carrying value of the relevant   \nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.    \n                                           \n  51    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

When assessing goodwill \nfor impairment, first, a qualitative          \nassessment can be made to determine whether it\nis more likely than not that the estimated    \nfair value of a reporting unit is less than   \nits estimated carrying value. If the results  \nof the qualitative assessment are not         \nconclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is   \nperformed. Alternatively, a quantitative      \ngoodwill test can be performed without        \nperforming a qualitative assessment. The      \nquantitative goodwill test compares the       \nestimated fair value of each reporting unit   \nwith its estimated net book value (including  \ngoodwill and identifiable intangible assets). \nIf the reporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value  \nexceeds its estimated net book value, goodwill\nis not impaired. An impairment is recognized  \nif the estimated fair value of a reporting    \nunit is less than its estimated net book      \nvalue. To estimate the fair value of each     \nreporting unit, other than Consumer banking, a\nrelative value technique is used because the  \nfirm believes market participants would use   \nthis technique to value these reporting units.\nThe relative value technique applies          \nobservable price-to-earningsmultiples or      \nprice-to-bookmultiples of comparable          \ncompetitors to reporting units\u2019 net earnings  \nor net book value. To estimate the fair value \nof Consumer banking, a discounted cash flow   \nvaluation approach is used because the firm   \nbelieves market participants would use this   \ntechnique to value that reporting unit given  \nits early stage of development. The estimated \nnet carrying value of each reporting unit     \nreflects an allocation of total shareholders\u2019 \nequity and represents the estimated amount of \ntotal shareholders\u2019 equity required to support\nthe activities of the reporting unit under    \ncurrently applicable regulatory capital       \nrequirements. In the fourth quarter of 2020,  \nthe firm performed its annual assessment of   \ngoodwill for impairment, for each of its      \nreporting units, by performing a qualitative  \nassessment. Multiple factors, including       \nperformance indicators, macroeconomic         \nindicators, firm and industry events, and fair\nvalue indicators, were assessed with respect  \nto each of the firm\u2019s reporting units to      \ndetermine whether it was more likely than not \nthat the estimated fair value of any of these \nreporting units was less than its estimated   \ncarrying value. The qualitative assessment    \nalso considered changes since the quantitative\ntest performed in the fourth quarter of 2019. \nAs a result of the qualitative assessment, the\nfirm determined that it was more likely than  \nnot that the estimated fair value of each of  \nthe reporting units exceeded its respective   \nestimated carrying value. Therefore, the firm \ndetermined that goodwill for each reporting   \nunit was not impaired and that a quantitative \ngoodwill test was not required.               \nThere were no events or\nchanges in\ncircumstances during\nthe six months ended\nJune 2021 that would\nindicate that it was\nmore likely than not\nthat the estimated fair\nvalue of each of the\nreporting units did not\nexceed its respective\nestimated carrying\nvalue as of June 2021.\nIdentifiable Intangible                       \nAssets                                        \nThe table below\npresents

The firm has the right,    \nfrom time to time, to defer payment of        \ninterest on the junior subordinated debt, and \ntherefore cause payment on the Trust\u2019s        \npreferred beneficial interests to be deferred,\nin each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual\nperiods.

Note 16.          \nSecuritization Activities The firm securitizes\nresidential and commercial mortgages,         \ncorporate bonds, loans and other types of     \nfinancial assets by selling these assets to   \nsecuritization vehicles (e.g., trusts,        \ncorporate entities and limited liability      \ncompanies) or through a resecuritization. The \nfirm acts as underwriter of the beneficial    \ninterests that are sold to investors. The     \nfirm\u2019s residential mortgage securitizations   \nare primarily in connection with government   \nagency securitizations. The firm accounts for \na securitization as a sale when it has        \nrelinquished control over the transferred     \nfinancial assets. Prior to securitization, the\nfirm generally accounts for assets pending    \ntransfer at fair value and therefore does not \ntypically recognize significant gains or      \nlosses upon the transfer of assets. Net       \nrevenues from underwriting activities are     \nrecognized in connection with the sales of the\nunderlying beneficial interests to investors. \nThe firm generally receives cash in exchange  \nfor the transferred assets but may also have  \ncontinuing involvement with the transferred   \nfinancial assets, including ownership of      \nbeneficial interests in securitized financial \nassets, primarily in the form of debt         \ninstruments. The firm may also purchase senior\nor subordinated securities issued by          \nsecuritization vehicles (which are typically  \nVIEs) in connection with secondary market-    \nmaking activities.                            \n                                           \n  61    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nfirm also extends\nlending commitments in\nconnection with other\ntypes of corporate\nlending, as well as\ncommercial real estate\nfinancing. See Note 9\nfor further\ninformation about\nfunded loans.\nTo mitigate the credit risk associated with   \nthe firm\u2019s commercial lending activities, the \nfirm obtains credit protection on certain     \nloans and lending commitments through credit  \ndefault swaps, both single-name and index-    \nbased contracts, and through the issuance of  \ncredit-linked notes. In addition, Sumitomo    \nMitsui Financial Group, Inc. provides the firm\nwith credit loss protection on certain        \napproved loan commitments. Warehouse          \nFinancing. The firm provides financing to     \nclients who warehouse financial assets. These \narrangements are secured by the warehoused    \nassets, primarily consisting of residential   \nreal estate, consumer and corporate loans.    \nCredit Cards. The firm\u2019s credit card lending  \ncommitments included $ 26.57billion as of June\n2021 and $ 21.64billion as of December 2020   \nrelated to credit card lines issued by the    \nfirm to consumers.

This amount \nrepresents the portfolio\u2019s outstanding credit \ncard loan balance as of June 2021. However,   \nthe final amount will depend on the           \noutstanding balance of credit card loans at   \nthe closing of the acquisition, which is      \nexpected to occur by the first quarter of     \n2022. Risk Participations The firm also risk  \nparticipates certain of its commercial lending\ncommitments to other financial institutions.  \nIn the event of a risk participant\u2019s default, \nthe firm will be responsible to fund the      \nborrower. Collateralized Agreement            \nCommitments/ Collateralized Financing         \nCommitments Collateralized agreement          \ncommitments includes forward starting resale  \nand securities borrowing agreements, and      \ncollateralized financing commitments includes \nforward starting repurchase and secured       \nlending agreements that settle at a future    \ndate, generally within three business days.   \nCollateralized agreement commitments also     \nincludes transactions where the firm has      \nentered into commitments to provide contingent\nfinancing to its clients and counterparties   \nthrough resale agreements. The firm\u2019s funding \nof these commitments depends on the           \nsatisfaction of all contractual conditions to \nthe resale agreement and these commitments can\nexpire unused.

The firm has\nconcluded that these\nconditions have been\nmet for certain large,\ninternationally active\ncommercial and\ninvestment bank\ncounterparties, central\nclearing\ncounterparties, hedge\nfunds and certain other\ncounterparties.Accordin\ngly, the firm has not\nincluded such contracts\nin the table above. See\nNote 7 for information\nabout credit\nderivatives that meet\nthe definition of a\nguarantee, which are\nnot included in the\ntable above.\n\nDerivatives are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue and therefore the\ncarrying value is\nconsidered the best\nindication of\npayment/performance\nrisk for individual\ncontracts. However, the\ncarrying values in the\ntable above exclude the\neffect of counterparty\nand cash collateral\nnetting.\n\nSecurities Lending and\nClearing Guarantees.\nSecurities lending and\nclearing guarantees\ninclude the\nindemnifications and\nguarantees that the\nfirm provides in its\ncapacity as an agency\nlender and in its\ncapacity as a\nsponsoring member of\nthe Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation.\n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    68  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) As an agency lender, the firm     \nindemnifies most of its securities lending    \ncustomers against losses incurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not return securities and   \nthe collateral held is insufficient to cover  \nthe market value of the securities borrowed.  \nThe maximum payout of such indemnifications   \nwas $ 17.86billion as of June 2021 and $      \n19.86billion as of December 2020. Collateral  \nheld by the lenders in connection with        \nsecurities lending indemnifications was $     \n18.34billion as of June 2021 and $            \n20.39billion as of December 2020. Because the \ncontractual nature of these arrangements      \nrequires the firm to obtain collateral with a \nmarket value that exceeds the value of the    \nsecurities lent to the borrower, there is     \nminimal performance risk associated with these\nindemnifications. As a sponsoring member of   \nthe Government Securities Division of the     \nFixed Income Clearing Corporation, the firm   \nguarantees the performance of its sponsored   \nmember clients to the Fixed Income Clearing   \nCorporation in connection with certain resale \nand repurchase agreements. To minimize        \npotential losses on such guarantees, the firm \nobtains a security interest in the collateral \nthat the sponsored client placed with the     \nFixed Income Clearing Corporation. Therefore, \nthe risk of loss on such guarantees is        \nminimal. There were noamounts outstanding     \nunder the guarantee as of June 2021. As of    \nDecember 2020, the maximum payout on this     \nguarantee was $ 1.49billion and the related   \ncollateral held was $ 1.50billion. Other      \nFinancial Guarantees. In the ordinary course  \nof business, the firm provides other financial\nguarantees of the obligations of third parties\n(e.g., standby letters of credit and other    \nguarantees to enable clients to complete      \ntransactions and fund-related guarantees).    \nThese guarantees represent obligations to make\npayments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed   \nparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a \ncontractual arrangement with that beneficiary.\nOther financial guarantees also include a     \nguarantee that the firm has provided to the   \nGovernment of Malaysia that it will receive at\nleast $ 1.4 billion in assets and proceeds    \nfrom assets seized by governmental authorities\naround the world related to 1Malaysia         \nDevelopment Berhad, a sovereign wealth fund in\nMalaysia (1MDB). The firm evaluates progress  \ntoward satisfying this obligation based on the\nreportthat it receives on a semi-annual basis,\nexpected in February and August. Based on the \nla test report as ofFebruary 2021,            \napproximately$ 220million in assets or        \nproceeds from assets has been returned to the \nGovernment of Malaysia in connection with this\nguarantee, which must be satisfied by August  \n18, 2025. Any amounts paid by the firm under  \nthis guarantee would be subject to            \nreimbursement in the event the assets or      \nproceeds received by the Government of        \nMalaysia through August 18, 2028 exceeds $    \n1.4billion. See Note 27 for further           \ninformation about matters related to 1MDB.    \nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The\nfirm has established trusts, including Goldman\nSachs Capital I, the APEX Trusts and other    \nentities, for the limited purpose of issuing  \nsecurities to third parties, lending the      \nproceeds to the firm and entering into        \ncontractual arrangements with the firm and    \nthird parties related to this purpose. The    \nfirm does not consolidate these entities. See \nNote 14 for further information about the     \ntransactions involving Goldman Sachs Capital I\nand the APEX Trusts. The firm effectively     \nprovides for the full and unconditional       \nguarantee of the securities issued by these   \nentities. Timely payment by the firm of       \namounts due to these entities under the       \nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and     \nrelated contractual arrangements will be      \nsufficient to cover payments due on the       \nsecurities issued by these entities. No       \nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the       \nsecurities of Goldman Sachs Capital I or the  \nAPEX Trusts. Management believes that it is   \nunlikely that any circumstances will occur,   \nsuch as nonperformance on the part of paying  \nagents or other service providers, that would \nmake it necessary for the firm to make        \npayments related to these entities other than \nthose required under the terms of the         \nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and     \nrelated contractual arrangements and in       \nconnection with certain expenses incurred by  \nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of \nService Providers. In the ordinary course of  \nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees \ncertain service providers, such as clearing   \nand custody agents, trustees and              \nadministrators, against specified potential   \nlosses in connection with their acting as an  \nagent of, or providing services to, the firm  \nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses   \narising from its custodial role or caused by  \nacts or omissions of third-party service      \nproviders, including sub-custodiansand third- \nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has \nthe right to seek indemnification from these  \nthird-party service providers for certain     \nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In      \naddition, the firm is a member of payment,    \nclearing and settlement networks, as well as  \nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of   \nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of   \nmember defaults and other loss scenarios.     \n                                           \n  69    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) In connection with the firm\u2019s     \nprime brokerage and clearing businesses, the  \nfirm agrees to clear and settle on behalf of  \nits clients the transactions entered into by  \nthem with other brokerage firms. The firm\u2019s   \nobligations in respect of such transactions   \nare secured by the assets in the client\u2019s     \naccount, as well as any proceeds received from\nthe transactions cleared and settled by the   \nfirm on behalf of the client. In connection   \nwith joint venture investments, the firm may  \nissue loan guarantees under which it may be   \nliable in the event of fraud,                 \nmisappropriation, environmental liabilities   \nand certain other matters involving the       \nborrower. The firm is unable to develop an    \nestimate of the maximum payout under these    \nguarantees and indemnifications. However,     \nmanagement believes that it is unlikely the   \nfirm will have to make any material payments  \nunder these arrangements, and no material     \nliabilities related to these guarantees and   \nindemnifications have been recognized in the  \nconsolidated balance sheets as of both June   \n2021 and December 2020. Other Representations,\nWarranties and Indemnifications. The firm     \nprovides representations and warranties to    \ncounterparties in connection with a variety of\ncommercial transactions and occasionally      \nindemnifies them against potential losses     \ncaused by the breach of those representations \nand warranties. The firm may also provide     \nindemnifications protecting against changes in\nor adverse application of certain U.S. tax    \nlaws in connection with ordinary-course       \ntransactions, such as securities issuances,   \nborrowings or derivatives. In addition, the   \nfirm may provide indemnifications to some     \ncounterparties to protect them in the event   \nadditional taxes are owed or payments are     \nwithheld, due either to a change in or an     \nadverse application of certain non-U.S.tax    \nlaws. These indemnifications generally are    \nstandard contractual terms and are entered    \ninto in the ordinary course of business.      \nGenerally, there are no stated or notional    \namounts included in these indemnifications,   \nand the contingencies triggering the          \nobligation to indemnify are not expected to   \noccur. The firm is unable to develop an       \nestimate of the maximum payout under these    \nguarantees and indemnifications. However,     \nmanagement believes that it is unlikely the   \nfirm will have to make any material payments  \nunder these arrangements, and no material     \nliabilities related to these arrangements have\nbeen recognized in the consolidated balance   \nsheets as of both June 2021 and December 2020.\nGuarantees of Subsidiaries. Group Inc. is the \nentity that fully and unconditionally         \nguarantees the securities issued by GS Finance\nCorp., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of   \nthe firm. Group Inc. has guaranteed the       \npayment obligations of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n(GS&Co.), GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Paris \nInc. et Cie, subject to certain exceptions. In\naddition, Group Inc. has provided guarantees  \nto Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and      \nGoldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) related to\nagreements that each entity has entered into  \nwith certain of its counterparties.           \nFurthermore, Group Inc. provided a guarantee  \nto GS Bank USA in 2020 related to securities  \nthat GS Bank USA acquired from certain        \naffiliated funds of Group Inc. and loans and  \nlending commitments that GS Bank USA acquired \nfrom certain subsidiaries of Group Inc. As of \nJune 2021, none of the securities acquired    \nfrom the affiliated funds were outstanding.   \nGroup Inc. guarantees many of the obligations \nof its other consolidated subsidiaries on a   \ntransaction-by-transactionbasis, as negotiated\nwith counterparties. Group Inc. is unable to  \ndevelop an estimate of the maximum payout     \nunder its subsidiary guarantees.

Regulation and Capital Adequacy The  \nFRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a \nBHC under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of\n1956 and a financial holding company under    \namendments to this Act. The firm is subject to\nconsolidated regulatory capital requirements  \nwhich are calculated in accordance with the   \nregulations of the FRB (Capital Framework).   \nThe capital requirements are expressed as     \nrisk-based capital and leverage ratios that   \ncompare measures of regulatory capital to     \nrisk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets   \nand off-balancesheet exposures. Failure to    \ncomply with these capital requirements could  \nresult in restrictions being imposed by the   \nfirm\u2019s regulators and could limit the firm\u2019s  \nability to repurchase shares, pay dividends   \nand make certain discretionary compensation   \npayments. The firm\u2019s capital levels are also  \nsubject to qualitative judgments by the       \nregulators about components of capital, risk  \nweightings and other factors. Furthermore,    \ncertain of the firm\u2019s subsidiaries are subject\nto separate regulations and capital           \nrequirements. Capital Framework The           \nregulations under the Capital Framework are   \nlargely based on the Basel Committee on       \nBanking Supervision\u2019s (Basel Committee)       \ncapital framework for strengthening           \ninternational capital standards (Basel III)   \nand also implement certain provisions of the  \nDodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework,  \nthe firm is an \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking    \norganization and has been designated as a     \nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB).   \nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum    \nrisk-based capital and the capital            \nconservation buffer requirements. The buffer  \nmust consist entirely of capital that         \nqualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)      \ncapital. The firm calculates its CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in    \naccordance with both the Standardized and     \nAdvanced Capital Rules.

For\nrisk management\npurposes, a 95 % one-\nday VaR is used,\nwhereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements,\na 99 % 10-day VaR is\nused to determine\nMarket RWAs and a 99 %\none-day VaR is used to\ndetermine regulatory\nVaR exceptions. In\naddition, the daily\nnet revenues used to\ndetermine risk\nmanagement VaR\nexceptions (i.e.,\ncomparing the daily\nnet revenues to the\nVaR measure calculated\nas of the end of the\nprior business day)\ninclude intraday\nactivity, whereas the\nCapital Framework\nrequires that intraday\nactivity be excluded\nfrom daily net\nrevenues when\ncalculating regulatory\nVaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity\nincludes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are\nmore likely than not\nto be positive by\ntheir nature. As a\nresult, there may be\ndifferences in the\nnumber of VaR\nexceptions and the\namount of daily net\nrevenues calculated\nfor regulatory VaR\ncompared to the\namounts calculated for\nrisk management VaR.\n\nThe firm\u2019s positional\nlosses observed on a\nsingle day did not\nexceed its 99 % one-\nday regulatory VaR\nduring the six months\nended June\u00a02021 and\nexceeded its 99 % one-\nday regulatory VaR on\nsix occasions during\n2020 (all of which\noccurred during\nMarch\u00a02020 and, as\npermitted by the FRB,\ndid not have any\nimpact on the firm\u2019s\nVaR multiplier used to\ncalculate Market\nRWAs);\n                                              \n       Stressed VaR is the potential loss in  \n       value of trading assets and            \n       liabilities, as well as certain        \n  \u2022    investments, loans, and other          \n       financial assets and liabilities       \n       accounted for at fair value, during a  \n       period of significant market stress;

Standardized\nCredit RWAs as of June\n2021 increased by $\n45.61 billion compared\nwith December 2020,\nprimarily reflecting\nan increase in\ncommitments,\nguarantees and loans\n(principally due to\nincreased lending\nactivity), an increase\nin derivatives\n(principally due to\nincreased exposures),\nan increase in equity\ninvestments\n(principally due to\nincreased exposures as\na result ofgains,\npartially offset by\nsales), and an\nincrease in securities\nfinancing transactions\n(principally due to\nincreasedexposures).\nStandardized Market\nRWAs as of June 2021\nincreased by$ 21.56\nbillion compared with\nDecember 2020,\nprimarily reflecting\nan increase in\nstressed VaR\n(principally due to\nincreased exposures to\ninterest rates).\nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of June 2021 increased\nby$ 32.93 billion compared with December 2020,\nprimarily reflecting an increase in           \ncommitments, guarantees and loans (principally\ndue to increased lending activity), an        \nincrease in equity investments (principally   \ndue to increased exposures as a result        \nofgains, partially offset by sales) and an    \nincrease in other credit RWAs (principally due\nto increased corporate debt , and customer and\noth er receivablesexposures). Advanced Market \nRWAs as of June 2021 increased by$ 21.56      \nbillion compared with December 2020, primarily\nreflecting an increase in stressed VaR        \n(principally due to increased exposures to    \ninterest rates). Year Ended December 2020.    \nStandardized Credit RWAs as of December 2020  \ndecreased by $ 13.55billion compared with     \nDecember 2019, primarily reflecting a decrease\nin equity investments (principally due to the \nsale of certain equity positions) and a       \ndecrease in other (principally due to         \ndecreased receivables as a result of changes  \nin risk measurements). These decreases were   \npartially offset by an increase in securities \nfinancing transactions (principally due to    \nincreased funding exposures). Standardized    \nMarket RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $\n4.14billion compared with December 2019,      \nprimarily reflecting an increase in regulatory\nVaR (principally due to increased market      \nvolatility) and an increase in incremental    \nrisk (principally due to increased exposures  \nin equities held for market-making purposes). \nThese increases were partially offset by a    \ndecrease in specific risk (principally due to \nchanges in risk measurements on certain       \nexposures). Advanced Credit RWAs as of        \nDecember 2020 increased by $ 51.63billion     \ncompared with December 2019, primarily        \nreflecting an increase in derivatives         \n(principally due to the impact of higher      \nlevels of volatility and counterparty credit  \nrisk) and an increase in commitments,         \nguarantees and loans (principally due to      \nincreased lending activity). These increases  \nwere partially offset by a decrease in equity \ninvestments (principally due to the sale of   \ncertain equity positions). Advanced Market    \nRWAs as of December 2020 increased by $       \n4.34billion compared with December 2019,      \nprimarily reflecting an increase in regulatory\nVaR (principally due to increased market      \nvolatility) and an increase in incremental    \nrisk (principally due to increased exposures  \nin equities held for market-making purposes). \nThese increases were partially offset by a    \ndecrease in specific risk (principally due to \nchanges in risk measurements on certain       \nexposures). Advanced Operational RWAs as of   \nDecember 2020 increased by $ 9.13billion      \ncompared with December 2019. The vast majority\nof this increase was associated with          \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings.        \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    78  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

GSIB is\nregulated by the\nPrudential Regulation\nAuthority (PRA) and\nthe Financial Conduct\nAuthority (FCA), and\nGSBE is directly\nsupervised by the\nEuropean Central Bank\nand by BaFin and\nDeutsche Bundesbank in\nthe context of the\nE.U. Single\nSupervisory Mechanism.\nAs of both June\u00a02021\nand December\u00a02020,\nGSIB and GSBE were in\ncompliance with their\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.\nOther. The deposits of GS Bank USA are insured\nby the FDIC to the extent provided by law. The\nFRB requires that GS Bank USA maintain cash   \nreserves with the Federal Reserve. As of both \nJune 2021 and December 2020, the reserve      \nrequirement ratio was zero percent. The amount\ndeposited by GS Bank USA at the Federal       \nReserve was $ 133.09billion as of June 2021   \nand $ 52.71billion as of December 2020.       \nRestrictions on Payments Group Inc. may be    \nlimited in its ability to access capital held \nat certain subsidiaries as a result of        \nregulatory, tax or other constraints. These   \nlimitations include provisions of applicable  \nlaw and regulations and other regulatory      \nrestrictions that limit the ability of those  \nsubsidiaries to declare and pay dividends     \nwithout prior regulatory approval. For        \nexample, the amount of dividends that may be  \npaid by GS Bank USA are limited to the lesser \nof the amounts calculated under a recent      \nearnings test and an undivided profits test.  \nIn connection with the acquisition of GSBE by \nGS Bank USA on July 1, 2021, Group Inc. made a\n$ 33billion cash capital contribution to GS   \nBank USA on that date. Since the acquisition  \nand through the date of this report, GS Bank  \nUSA has declared and paid approximately$      \n33billion of dividends to Group Inc., largely \nreflecting the subsequent maturity or         \nsettlement of assets held by GSBE on the      \nacquisition date. Accordingly, GS Bank USA    \ncannot currently declare any additional       \ndividends without prior regulatory approval . \nIn addition, subsidiaries not subject to      \nseparate regulatory capital requirements may  \nhold capital to satisfy local tax and legal   \nguidelines, rating agency requirements (for   \nentities with assigned credit ratings) or     \ninternal policies, including policies         \nconcerning the minimum amount of capital a    \nsubsidiary should hold based on its underlying\nlevel of risk. Group Inc.\u2019s equity investment \nin subsidiaries was $ 111.10billion as of June\n2021 and $ 103.80billion as of December 2020, \nof which Group Inc. was required to maintain $\n72.26billion as of June 2021 and $            \n63.68billion as of December 2020, of minimum  \nequity capital in its regulated subsidiaries  \nin order to satisfy the regulatory            \nrequirements of such subsidiaries. Group      \nInc.\u2019s capital invested in certain            \nnon-U.S.subsidiaries is exposed to foreign    \nexchange risk, substantially all of which is  \nmanaged through a combination of derivatives  \nand non-U.S.denominated debt.

The firm  \nallocates assets (including allocations of    \nglobal core liquid assets and cash, secured   \nclient financing and other assets), revenues  \nand expenses among the four business segments.\nDue to the integrated nature of these         \nsegments, estimates and judgments are made in \nallocating certain assets, revenues and       \nexpenses. The allocation process is based on  \nthe manner in which management currently views\nthe performance of the segments. The          \nallocation of common shareholders\u2019 equity and \npreferred stock dividends to each segment is  \nbased on the estimated amount of equity       \nrequired to support the activities of the     \nsegment under relevant regulatory capital     \nrequirements. Net earnings for each segment is\ncalculated by applying the firmwide tax rate  \nto each segment\u2019s pre-taxearnings. Management \nbelieves that this allocation provides a      \nreasonable representation of each segment\u2019s   \ncontribution to consolidated net earnings to  \ncommon, return on average common equity and   \ntotal assets. Transactions between segments   \nare based on specific criteria or approximate \nthird-party rates.                            \n                                           \n  83    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These\nactivities expose the\nfirm to many different\nindustries and\ncounterparties, and\nmay also subject the\nfirm to a\nconcentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular central\nbank, counterparty,\nborrower or issuer,\nincluding sovereign\nissuers, or to a\nparticular clearing\nhouse or exchange. The\nfirm seeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by\nactively monitoring\nexposures and\nobtaining collateral\nfrom counterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm\nconsiders when\ndetermining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts. Netting and\ncollateral agreements\npermit the firm to\noffset receivables and\npayables with such\ncounterparties and/or\nenable the firm to\nobtain collateral on\nan upfront or\ncontingent basis.\nThe table below\npresents the credit\nconcentrations\nincluded in trading\ncash instruments and\ninvestments.\n                                              \n                          As of               \n  $ in\u00a0millions        June2021     December  \n                                        2020  \n  U.S. government                             \n  and agency           $144,443     $187,009  \n  obligations                                 \n  Percentage of           10.4%        16.1%  \n  total assets                                \n  Non-U.S.governme\u2026                           \n  and agency            $70,370    $\u00a0\u00a059,580  \n  obligations                                 \n  Percentage of            5.1%         5.1%  \n  total assets                                \n                                              \nIn addition, the firm\nhad $ 202.20billion as\nof June 2021 and $\n116.63billion as of\nDecember 2020 of cash\ndeposits held at\ncentral banks\n(included in cash and\ncash equivalents), of\nwhich $ 133.09billion\nas of June 2021 and $\n52.71billion as of\nDecember 2020 was held\nat the Federal\nReserve.\nAs of both June 2021\nand December 2020, the\nfirm did not have\ncredit exposure to any\nother counterparty\nthat exceeded 2% of\ntotal assets.\nCollateral obtained by\nthe firm related to\nderivative assets is\nprincipally cash and is\nheld by the firm or a\nthird-party custodian.\nCollateral obtained by\nthe firm related to\nresale agreements and\nsecurities borrowed\ntransactions is\nprimarily U.S.\ngovernment and agency\nobligations and\nnon-U.S. government and\nagency obligations.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) With respect to matters described \nbelow for which management has been able to   \nestimate a range of reasonably possible loss  \nwhere (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have \nclaimed an amount of money damages, (ii) the  \nfirm is being, or threatened to be, sued by   \npurchasers in a securities offering and is not\nbeing indemnified by a party that the firm    \nbelieves will pay the full amount of any      \njudgment, or (iii) the purchasers are         \ndemanding that the firm repurchase securities,\nmanagement has estimated the upper end of the \nrange of reasonably possible loss based on (a)\nin the case of (i), the amount of money       \ndamages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the \ndifference between the initial sales price of \nthe securities that the firm sold in such     \noffering and the estimated lowest subsequent  \nprice of such securities prior to the action  \nbeing commenced and (c) in the case of (iii), \nthe price that purchasers paid for the        \nsecurities less the estimated value, if any,  \nas of June 2021 of the relevant securities, in\neach of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking into\naccount any other factors believed to be      \nrelevant to the particular matter or matters  \nof that type. As of the date hereof, the firm \nhas estimated the upper end of the range of   \nreasonably possible aggregate loss for such   \nmatters and for any other matters described   \nbelow where management has been able to       \nestimate a range of reasonably possible       \naggregate loss to be approximately $          \n1.8billion in excess of the aggregate reserves\nfor such matters. Management is generally     \nunable to estimate a range of reasonably      \npossible loss for matters other than those    \nincluded in the estimate above, including     \nwhere (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have \nnot claimed an amount of money damages, except\nin those instances where management can       \notherwise determine an appropriate amount,    \n(ii) matters are in early stages, (iii)       \nmatters relate to regulatory investigations or\nreviews, except in those instances where      \nmanagement can otherwise determine an         \nappropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty \nas to the likelihood of a class being         \ncertified or the ultimate size of the class,  \n(v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of \npending appeals or motions, (vi) there are    \nsignificant factual issues to be resolved,    \nand/or (vii) there are novel legal issues     \npresented. For example, the firm\u2019s potential  \nliabilities with respect to the investigations\nand reviews described below in \u201cRegulatory    \nInvestigations and Reviews and Related        \nLitigation\u201d generally are not included in     \nmanagement\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible  \nloss. However, management does not believe,   \nbased on currently available information, that\nthe outcomes of such other matters will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the firm\u2019s         \nfinancial condition, though the outcomes could\nbe material to the firm\u2019s operating results   \nfor any particular period, depending, in part,\nupon the operating results for such period.   \nSee Note 18 for further information about     \nmortgage-related contingencies. 1MDB-Related  \nMatters Between 2012 and 2013, subsidiaries of\nthe firm acted as arrangers or purchasers of  \napproximately $ 6.5billion of debt securities \nof 1MDB. On November 1, 2018, the U.S.        \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a        \ncriminal information and guilty plea by Tim   \nLeissner, a former participating managing     \ndirector of the firm, and an indictment       \nagainst Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing       \ndirector of the firm. On August 28, 2018,     \nLeissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S.   \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork of conspiring to launder money and to    \nviolate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices    \nAct\u2019s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal        \naccounting controls provisions. Ng was charged\nwith conspiring to launder money and to       \nviolate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery and internal  \naccounting controls provisions. On May 6,     \n2019, Ng pleaded not guilty to the DOJ\u2019s      \ncriminal charges. On August 18, 2020, the firm\nannounced that it entered into a settlement   \nagreement with the Government of Malaysia to  \nresolve the criminal and regulatory           \nproceedings in Malaysia involving the firm,   \nwhich includes a guarantee that the Government\nof Malaysia receives at least $ 1.4billion in \nassets and proceeds from assets seized by     \ngovernmental authorities around the world     \nrelated to 1MDB. On October 22, 2020, the firm\nannounced that it reached settlements of      \ngovernmental and regulatory investigations    \nrelating to 1MDB with the DOJ, the SEC, the   \nFRB, the NYDFS, the FCA, the PRA, the         \nSingapore Attorney General\u2019s Chambers, the    \nSingapore Commercial Affairs Department, the  \nMonetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong  \nKong Securities and Futures Commission. Group \nInc. entered into a three-year deferred       \nprosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a\ncharge against the firm, one count of         \nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and \nwill later be dismissed if the firm abides by \nthe terms of the agreement. In addition, GS   \nMalaysia pleaded guilty to one count of       \nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was       \nsentenced on June 9, 2021. In May 2021, the   \nU.S. Department of Labor granted the firm a   \nfive-year exemption to maintain its status as \na qualified professional asset manager (QPAM).\n                                           \n  87    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) The firm has received multiple    \ndemands, beginning in November 2018, from     \nalleged shareholders under Section 220 of the \nDelaware General Corporation Law for books and\nrecords relating to, among other things, the  \nfirm\u2019s involvement with 1MDB and the firm\u2019s   \ncompliance procedures. On December 13, 2019,  \nan alleged shareholder filed a lawsuit in the \nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware    \nseeking books and records relating to, among  \nother things, the firm\u2019s involvement with 1MDB\nand the firm\u2019s compliance procedures. The     \nparties have agreed to stay proceedings       \npending resolution of the books and records   \ndemand. On February 19, 2019, a purported     \nshareholder derivative action relating to 1MDB\nwas filed in the U.S. District Court for the  \nSouthern District of New York against Group   \nInc. and the directors at the time and a      \nformer chairman and chief executive officer of\nthe firm. The second amended complaint filed  \non November 13, 2020 alleges breaches of      \nfiduciary duties, including in connection with\nalleged insider trading by certain current and\nformer directors, unjust enrichment and       \nviolations of the anti-fraud provisions of the\nExchange Act, including in connection with    \nGroup Inc.\u2019s common stock repurchases and     \nsolicitation of proxies, and seeks unspecified\ndamages, disgorgement and injunctive relief.  \nDefendants moved to dismiss this action on    \nJanuary 15, 2021. Beginning in March 2019, the\nfirm has also received demands from three     \nshareholders to investigate and pursue claims \nagainst certain current and former directors  \nand executive officers based on their         \noversight and public disclosures regarding    \n1MDB and related internal controls. In June   \n2019, the Board appointed a Special Committee \nto consider the demands and, in January 2021, \nthe Board voted to reject them. In June 2021, \nthe firm reached a settlement with the three  \nshareholders. Following the Board\u2019s decision  \nto reject the initial three demands, the firm \nreceived two additional demands from alleged  \nshareholders (one of which is the alleged     \nshareholder that filed the December 2019 books\nand records action in Delaware Chancery Court)\nto investigate and pursue claims related to   \n1MDB (and, for one of the demands, other      \nmatters) against other parties, including     \ncertain current and former directors and      \nexecutive officers of the firm. On December   \n20, 2018, a putative securities class action  \nlawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court  \nfor the Southern District of New York against \nGroup Inc. and certain former officers of the \nfirm alleging violations of the anti-fraud    \nprovisions of the Exchange Act with respect to\nGroup Inc.\u2019s disclosures and public statements\nconcerning 1MDB and seeking unspecified       \ndamages. The plaintiffs filed the second      \namended complaint on October 28, 2019. On June\n28, 2021, the court dismissed the claims      \nagainst one of the individual defendants but  \ndenied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss with \nrespect to the firm and the remaining         \nindividual defendants. Mortgage-Related       \nMatters Beginning in April 2010, a number of  \npurported securities law class actions were   \nfiled in the U.S. District Court for the      \nSouthern District of New York challenging the \nadequacy of Group Inc.\u2019s public disclosure of,\namong other things, the firm\u2019s activities in  \nthe collateralized debt obligation market, and\nthe firm\u2019s conflict of interest management.   \nThe consolidated amended complaint filed on   \nJuly 25, 2011, which named as defendants Group\nInc. and certain current and former officers  \nand employees of Group Inc. and its           \naffiliates, generally alleges violations of   \nSections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act  \nand seeks monetary damages. The defendants    \nhave moved for summary judgment. On April 7,  \n2020, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals     \naffirmed the district court\u2019s August 14, 2018 \ngrant of class certification. On June 21,     \n2021, the United States Supreme Court vacated \nthe judgment of the Second Circuit and        \nremanded the case for further proceedings.    \nComplaints were filed in the U.S. District    \nCourt for the Southern District of New York on\nJuly 25, 2019 and May 29, 2020 against Goldman\nSachs Mortgage Company and GS Mortgage        \nSecurities Corp. by U.S. Bank National        \nAssociation, as trustee for two residential   \nmortgage-backed securitization trusts that    \nissued $ 1.7billion of securities. The        \ncomplaints generally allege that mortgage     \nloans in the trusts failed to conform to      \napplicable representations and warranties and \nseek specific performance or, alternatively,  \ncompensatory damages and other relief. On     \nNovember 23, 2020, the court granted in part  \nand denied in part defendants\u2019 motion to      \ndismiss the complaint in the first action and \ndenied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the      \ncomplaint in the second action. On January 14,\n2021, amended complaints were filed in both   \nactions.                                      \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    88  \n                                           \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The \nthird amended complaint in the U.S. district  \ncourt action, filed on August 3, 2020,        \ngenerally alleges that the defendants violated\nfederal antitrust law and state common law in \nconnection with an alleged conspiracy to      \nmanipulate the foreign currency exchange      \nmarkets and seeks declaratory and injunctive  \nrelief, as well as unspecified amounts of     \ncompensatory, punitive, treble and other      \ndamages. The claim in the U.K. action is for  \nbreaches of U.K. and E.U. competition rules   \nfrom 2003 to 2013 and alleges manipulation of \nforeign exchange rates and bid/offer spreads, \nthe exchange of commercially sensitive        \ninformation among defendants and collusive    \ntrading. Banco Espirito Santo S.A. and Oak    \nFinance Beginning in February 2015, GSI       \ncommenced actions against Novo Banco S.A.     \n(Novo Banco) in the English Commercial Court  \nand the Bank of Portugal (BoP) in Portuguese  \nAdministrative Court in response to BoP\u2019s     \ndecision in December 2014 not to transfer to  \nNovo Banco an $ 835million facility agreement \n(the Facility), structured by GSI, between Oak\nFinance Luxembourg S.A. (Oak Finance), a      \nspecial purpose vehicle formed in connection  \nwith the Facility, and Banco Espirito Santo   \nS.A. (BES) prior to the failure of BES. In    \nJuly 2018, the English Supreme Court found    \nthat the English courts did not have          \njurisdiction over GSI\u2019s action. In July 2018, \nthe Liquidation Committee for BES issued a    \ndecision seeking to claw back $ 54million paid\nto GSI and $ 50million paid to Oak Finance in \nconnection with the Facility, alleging that   \nGSI acted in bad faith in extending the       \nFacility, including because GSI allegedly knew\nthat BES was at risk of imminent failure. GSI \nhas also issued a claim against the Portuguese\nState seeking compensation for losses related \nto the failure of BES, including a contingent \nclaim for the $ 104million sought by the      \nLiquidation Committee. Financial Advisory     \nServices Group Inc. and certain of its        \naffiliates are from time to time parties to   \nvarious civil litigation and arbitration      \nproceedings and other disputes with clients   \nand third parties relating to the firm\u2019s      \nfinancial advisory activities. These claims   \ngenerally seek, among other things,           \ncompensatory damages and, in some cases,      \npunitive damages, and in certain cases allege \nthat the firm did not appropriately disclose  \nor deal with conflicts of interest.           \nUnderwriting Litigation Firm affiliates are   \namong the defendants in a number of           \nproceedings in connection with securities     \nofferings. In these proceedings, including    \nthose described below, the plaintiffs assert  \nclass action or individual claims under       \nfederal and state securities laws and in some \ncases other applicable laws, allege that the  \noffering documents for the securities that    \nthey purchased contained material             \nmisstatements and omissions, and generally    \nseek compensatory and rescissory damages in   \nunspecified amounts. Certain of these         \nproceedings involve additional allegations.   \nAltice USA, Inc. GS&Co. is among the          \nunderwriters named as defendants in putative  \nsecurities class actions pending in New York  \nSupreme Court, County of Queens, and the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork beginning in June 2018, relating to      \nAltice USA, Inc.\u2019s (Altice) $ 2.15billion June\n2017 initial public offering. In addition to  \nthe underwriters, the defendants include      \nAltice and certain of its officers and        \ndirectors.

Based on our reviews, \nwe are not aware of any material modifications\nthat should be made to the accompanying       \ninterim financial statements for them to be in\nconformity with accounting principles         \ngenerally accepted in the United States of    \nAmerica. We have previously audited, in       \naccordance with the standards of the Public   \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United    \nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance     \nsheet of the Company as of December 31, 2020, \nand the related consolidated statements of    \nearnings, comprehensive income, changes in    \nshareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for the   \nyear then ended (not presented herein), and in\nour report dated February 19, 2021, which     \nincluded a paragraph describing a change in   \nthe manner of accounting for credit losses on \ncertain financial instruments in the 2020     \nconsolidated financial statements, we         \nexpressed an unqualified opinion on those     \nconsolidated financial statements. In our     \nopinion, the information set forth in the     \naccompanying consolidated balance sheet as of \nDecember 31, 2020 is fairly stated in all     \nmaterial respects in relation to the          \nconsolidated balance sheet from which it has  \nbeen derived. Basis for Review Results These  \ninterim financial statements are the          \nresponsibility of the Company\u2019s management. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with  \nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent  \nwith respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the      \napplicable rules and regulations of the       \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the    \nPCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance  \nwith the standards of the PCAOB. A review of  \ninterim financial information consists        \nprincipally of applying analytical procedures \nand making inquiries of persons responsible   \nfor financial and accounting matters. It is   \nsubstantially less in scope than an audit     \nconducted in accordance with the standards of \nthe PCAOB, the objective of which is the      \nexpression of an opinion regarding the        \nfinancial statements taken as a whole.        \nAccordingly, we do not express such an        \nopinion. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New   \nYork, New York August 3, 2021                 \n                                           \n  95    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We generated net earnings of $5.49 \nbillion for the second quarter of 2021,       \nsignificantly higher compared with $373       \nmillion for the second quarter of 2020.       \nDiluted earnings per common share (EPS) was   \n$15.02 for the second quarter of 2021,        \nsignificantly higher compared with $0.53 for  \nthe second quarter of 2020. Annualized return \non average common shareholders\u2019 equity (ROE)  \nwas 23.7% for the second quarter of 2021,     \ncompared with 1.0% for the second quarter of  \n2020. Book value per common share was $264.90 \nas of June 2021, 5.6% higher compared with    \nMarch 2021 and 12.2% higher compared with     \nDecember 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, \nnet provisions for litigation and regulatory  \nproceedings reduced diluted EPS by $8.23 and  \nannualized ROE by 14.5 percentage points. Net \nrevenues were $15.39 billion for the second   \nquarter of 2021, 16% higher than the second   \nquarter of 2020, due to significantly higher  \nnet revenues in Asset Management, reflecting  \nstrong Equity investments net revenues, in    \nInvestment Banking, primarily reflecting      \nstrong Financial advisory and Underwriting net\nrevenues, and in Consumer & Wealth Management,\nreflecting growth in both Wealth management   \nand Consumer banking net revenues. These      \nincreases were partially offset by            \nsignificantly lower net revenues in Global    \nMarkets compared with a very strong second    \nquarter of 2020, which included strong        \nactivity levels amid heightened volatility and\nsignificant market dislocations. The decrease \nin Global Markets reflected significantly     \nlower net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency  \nand Commodities (FICC) and lower net revenues \nin Equities. Provision for credit losses was a\nnet benefit of $92 million for the second     \nquarter of 2021, compared with net provisions \nof $1.59 billion for the second quarter of    \n2020. The second quarter of 2021 included     \nreserve reductions on wholesale and consumer  \nloans reflecting continued improvement in the \nbroader economic environment following        \nchallenging conditions that began in the first\nhalf of 2020 as a result of the coronavirus   \n(COVID-19)pandemic, partially offset by       \nprovisions related to portfolio growth        \n(primarily in credit cards).                  \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    98  \n                                           \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nexpenses were $8.64 billion for the second    \nquarter of 2021, 17% lower than the second    \nquarter of 2020, due to significantly lower   \nnet provisions for litigation and regulatory  \nproceedings, partially offset by higher       \ncompensation and benefits expenses (reflecting\nstrong performance). In addition, transaction \nbased expenses and technology expenses were   \nhigher. Our efficiency ratio (total operating \nexpenses divided by total net revenues) for   \nthe second quarter of 2021 was 56.1%, compared\nwith 78.3% for the second quarter of 2020. In \nthe second quarter of 2020, net provisions for\nlitigation and regulatory proceedings         \nincreased our efficiency ratio by 22.2        \npercentage points. We returned $1.44 billion  \nof capital to common shareholders, including  \n$1.00 billion of share repurchases and $441   \nmillion of common stock dividends. As of June \n2021, our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital \nratio was 14.4% under the Standardized Capital\nRules and 13.4% under the Advanced Capital    \nRules. See Note 20 to the consolidated        \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout our capital ratios. We remain focused on\nour strategic initiative to achieve the annual\nrun-rateexpense efficiencies target of $1.3   \nbillion by year-end2022. In addition, we      \nexpect that we will achieve an additional $400\nmillion of expense efficiencies beyond year-  \nend2022. Six Months Ended June 2021 versus    \nJune 2020. We generated net earnings of $12.32\nbillion for the first half of 2021,           \nsignificantly higher compared with $1.59      \nbillion for the first half of 2020. Diluted   \nEPS was $33.64 for the first half of 2021,    \nsignificantly higher compared with $3.66 for  \nthe first half of 2020. Annualized ROE was    \n27.3% for the first half of 2021, compared    \nwith 3.3% for the first half of 2020. In the  \nfirst half of 2020, net provisions for        \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings reduced \ndiluted EPS by $8.76 and annualized ROE by 7.8\npercentage points. Net revenues were $33.09   \nbillion for the first half of 2021, 50% higher\nthan the first half of 2020, due to           \nsignificantly higher net revenues in Asset    \nManagement, primarily reflecting strong Equity\ninvestments net revenues, in Investment       \nBanking, primarily reflecting strong          \nUnderwriting and Financial advisory net       \nrevenues, and in Consumer & Wealth Management,\nreflecting growth in both Wealth management   \nand Consumer banking net revenues. Net        \nrevenues in Global Markets were strong across \nboth FICC and Equities, but essentially       \nunchanged compared with the first half of     \n2020. Provision for credit losses was a net   \nbenefit of $162 million for the first half of \n2021, compared with net provisions of $2.53   \nbillion for the first half of 2020. The first \nhalf of 2021 included reserve reductions on   \nwholesale and consumer loans reflecting       \ncontinued improvement in the broader economic \nenvironment following challenging conditions  \nthat began in the first half of 2020 as a     \nresult of the COVID-19pandemic, partially     \noffset by provisions related to portfolio     \ngrowth (primarily in credit cards, including  \nprovisions related to the pending acquisition \nof the General Motors co-brandedcredit card   \nportfolio). Operating expenses were $18.08    \nbillion for the first half of 2021, 7% higher \nthan the first half of 2020, reflecting       \nsignificantly higher compensation and benefits\nexpenses (reflecting strong performance),     \npartially offset by significantly lower non-  \ncompensationexpenses. Within non-             \ncompensationexpenses, net provisions for      \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings were    \nsignificantly lower, partially offset by      \nhigher transaction based expenses and higher  \ntechnology expenses. Our efficiency ratio     \n(total operating expenses divided by total net\nrevenues) for the first half of 2021 was      \n54.6%, compared with 76.6% for the first half \nof 2020. In the first half of 2020, net       \nprovisions for litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings increased our efficiency ratio by \n14.3 percentage points. During the first half \nof 2021, we returned $4.59 billion of capital \nto common shareholders, including $3.70       \nbillion of common share repurchases and $889  \nmillion in common stock dividends. Business   \nEnvironment In the second quarter of 2021, the\nglobal economy continued its recovery from the\nCOVID-19pandemic, as the lifting of health and\nsafety restrictions in parts of the world amid\nvaccine distribution facilitated an increase  \nin global economic activity. The broader      \neconomic improvement was also aided by        \naccommodative monetary policy provided by     \nglobal central banks in response to the       \npandemic (through low policy rates and large- \nscale asset purchases) and, in the U.S., the  \nprospect of further fiscal stimulus in the    \nform of infrastructure spending. The growth in\neconomic activity and demand for goods and    \nservices, alongside labor shortages and supply\nchain complications, contributed to rising    \ninflationary pressures. However, investors    \nremained optimistic about the prospect for    \ncontinued economic recovery, as global equity \nprices generally increased during the quarter,\nwhile volatility continued to moderate from   \nelevated levels. In addition, long-term       \ngovernment bond yields generally declined.    \n                                           \n  99    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                           \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Use of   \nEstimates U.S. GAAP requires us to make       \ncertain estimates and assumptions. In addition\nto the estimates we make in connection with   \nfair value measurements and the allowance for \ncredit losses on loans and lending commitments\nheld for investment and accounted for at      \namortized cost, the use of estimates and      \nassumptions is also important in determining  \ndiscretionary compensation accruals, the      \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and provisions for losses    \nthat may arise from tax audits. A substantial \nportion of our compensation and benefits      \nrepresents discretionary compensation, which  \nis finalized at year-end.We believe the most  \nappropriate way to allocate estimated year-   \nenddiscretionary compensation among interim   \nperiods is in proportion to the net revenues  \nearned in such periods. In addition to the    \nlevel of net revenues, our overall            \ncompensation expense in any given year is also\ninfluenced by, among other factors, overall   \nfinancial performance, prevailing labor       \nmarkets, business mix, the structure of our   \nshare-based compensation programs and the     \nexternal environment. Goodwill is assessed for\nimpairment annually in the fourth quarter or  \nmore frequently if events occur or            \ncircumstances change that indicate an         \nimpairment may exist. When assessing goodwill \nfor impairment, first, a qualitative          \nassessment can be made to determine whether it\nis more likely than not that the estimated    \nfair value of a reporting unit is less than   \nits estimated carrying value. If the results  \nof the qualitative assessment are not         \nconclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is   \nperformed. Alternatively, a quantitative      \ngoodwill test can be performed without        \nperforming a qualitative assessment.          \nEstimating the fair value of our reporting    \nunits requires judgment. Critical inputs to   \nthe fair value estimates include projected    \nearnings and allocated equity. There is       \ninherent uncertainty in the projected         \nearnings. The estimated carrying value of each\nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and represents the       \nestimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity\nrequired to support the activities of the     \nreporting unit under currently applicable     \nregulatory capital requirements. See Note 12  \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about goodwill. If we     \nexperience a prolonged or severe period of    \nweakness in the business environment,         \nfinancial markets, our performance or our     \ncommon stock price, or additional increases in\ncapital requirements, our goodwill could be   \nimpaired in the future. Identifiable          \nintangible assets are tested for impairment   \nwhen events or changes in circumstances       \nsuggest that an asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s      \ncarrying value may not be fully recoverable.  \nJudgment is required to evaluate whether      \nindications of potential impairment have      \noccurred, and to test intangible assets for   \nimpairment, if required. An impairment is     \nrecognized if the estimated undiscounted cash \nflows relating to the asset or asset group is \nless than the corresponding carrying value.   \nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial     \nstatements for further information about      \nidentifiable intangible assets. We also       \nestimate and provide for potential losses that\nmay arise out of litigation and regulatory    \nproceedings to the extent that such losses are\nprobable and can be reasonably estimated. In  \naddition, we estimate the upper end of the    \nrange of reasonably possible aggregate loss in\nexcess of the related reserves for litigation \nand regulatory proceedings where we believe   \nthe risk of loss is more than slight. See     \nNotes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial \nstatements for information about certain      \njudicial, litigation and regulatory           \nproceedings. Significant judgment is required \nin making these estimates and our final       \nliabilities may ultimately be materially      \ndifferent. Our total estimated liability in   \nrespect of litigation and regulatory          \nproceedings is determined on a case-by-       \ncasebasis and represents an estimate of       \nprobable losses after considering, among other\nfactors, the progress of each case, proceeding\nor investigation, our experience and the      \nexperience of others in similar cases,        \nproceedings or investigations, and the        \nopinions and views of legal counsel. In       \naccounting for income taxes, we recognize tax \npositions in the financial statements only    \nwhen it is more likely than not that the      \nposition will be sustained on examination by  \nthe relevant taxing authority based on the    \ntechnical merits of the position. See Note 24 \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about income taxes.

Results of Operations The       \ncomposition of our net revenues has varied    \nover time as financial markets and the scope  \nof our operations have changed. The           \ncomposition of net revenues can also vary over\nthe shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S.  \nand global economic and market conditions.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nEnvironment. During the second quarter of     \n2021, economic recovery, the lifting of health\nand safety restrictions in parts of the world \namid vaccine distribution, and continued      \nmonetary and fiscal support from central banks\nand governments provided a favorable market   \nbackdrop. These factors contributed to        \ngenerally higher global equity prices compared\nwith the first quarter of 2021, a supportive  \nenvironment for alternative investments,      \nelevated investment banking activity levels,  \nand more modest yet solid market-making       \nactivity levels. If optimism about the        \neconomic outlook declines or the ongoing      \nefforts to mitigate the impact of the         \nCOVID-19pandemic are ineffective (including   \ndue to new variants or complications with the \nvaccine distribution), it may lead to worsened\neconomic conditions for alternative           \ninvestments, a further decline in market-     \nmaking activity levels, a decline in          \ninvestment banking activity levels, and a     \ndecline in global equity markets, and net     \nrevenues and the provision for credit losses  \nwould likely be negatively impacted. See      \n\u201cSegment Assets and Operating Results \u2014       \nSegment Operating Results\u201d for information    \nabout the operating environment and material  \ntrends and uncertainties that may impact our  \nresults of operations. Three Months Ended June\n2021 versus June 2020. Net revenues in the    \nconsolidated statements of earnings were      \n$15.39 billion for the second quarter of 2021,\n16% higher than the second quarter of 2020,   \nreflecting significantly higher other         \nprincipal transactions, investment banking    \nrevenues and net interest income, and higher  \ninvestment management revenues, partially     \noffset by significantly lower market making   \nrevenues. Non-InterestRevenues. Investment    \nbanking revenues in the consolidated          \nstatements of earnings were $3.45 billion for \nthe second quarter of 2021, 26% higher than   \nthe second quarter of 2020, reflecting        \nsignificantly higher revenues in financial    \nadvisory, reflecting an increase in completed \nmergers and acquisitions transactions, and    \nhigher revenues in equity underwriting,       \nprimarily driven by strong industry-wide      \ninitial public offering activity, partially   \noffset by a significant decline in industry-  \nwide secondary offerings. These increases were\npartially offset by slightly lower revenues in\ndebt underwriting, primarily reflecting       \nsignificantly lower industry-wide investment- \ngrade volumes, partially offset by elevated   \nindustry-wide leveraged finance volumes.      \nInvestment management revenues in the         \nconsolidated statements of earnings were $1.91\nbillion for the second quarter of 2021, 17%   \nhigher than the second quarter of 2020,       \nprimarily due to higher management and other  \nfees, reflecting the impact of higher average \nassets under supervision (AUS), partially     \noffset by fee waivers on money market funds.  \nCommissions and fees in the consolidated      \nstatements of earnings were $833 million for  \nthe second quarter of 2021, slightly lower    \nthan the second quarter of 2020. Market making\nrevenues in the consolidated statements of    \nearnings were $3.27 billion for the second    \nquarter of 2021, 43% lower than the second    \nquarter of 2020, primarily due to             \nsignificantly lower revenues in interest rate \nproducts, credit products, equity products    \n(primarily in cash products), commodities and \ncurrencies. Other principal transactions      \nrevenues in the consolidated statements of    \nearnings were $4.30 billion for the second    \nquarter of 2021, compared with $1.32 billion  \nfor the second quarter of 2020, primarily     \nreflecting significantly higher net gains from\ninvestments in private equities, driven by    \ncompany-specific events, including capital    \nraises and sales, and improved corporate      \nperformance versus a challenging second       \nquarter of 2020. Net Interest Income. Net     \ninterest income in the consolidated statements\nof earnings was $1.63 billion for the second  \nquarter of 2021, 73% higher than the second   \nquarter of 2020, reflecting a decrease in     \ninterest expense primarily related to long-   \nterm borrowings and deposits, both reflecting \nthe impact of lower interest rates. The       \ndecrease in interest expense was partially    \noffset by a decrease in interest income       \nprimarily related to collateralized agreements\nand trading assets, both reflecting the impact\nof lower interest rates partially offset by   \nthe impact of higher average balances for     \nother interest-earning assets.

Such \nexpenses were previously reported in other    \nexpenses. Previously reported amounts have    \nbeen conformed to the current presentation.   \nThree Months Ended June 2021 versus June 2020.\nOperating expenses in the consolidated        \nstatements of earnings were $8.64 billion for \nthe second quarter of 2021, 17% lower than the\nsecond quarter of 2020. Our efficiency ratio  \n(total operating expenses divided by total net\nrevenues) for the second quarter of 2021 was  \n56.1%, compared with 78.3% for the second     \nquarter of 2020. In the second quarter of     \n2020, net provisions for litigation and       \nregulatory proceedings increased our          \nefficiency ratio by 22.2 percentage points.   \nThe decrease in operating expenses compared   \nwith the second quarter of 2020 was due to    \nsignificantly lower non-compensationexpenses, \npartially offset by higher compensation and   \nbenefits expenses (reflecting strong          \nperformance). Within non-compensationexpenses,\nnet provisions for litigation and regulatory  \nproceedings were significantly lower,         \npartially offset by higher transaction based  \nexpenses and higher technology expenses       \n(included in communications and technology and\ndepreciation and amortization). Net provisions\nfor litigation and regulatory proceedings for \nthe second quarter of 2021 were $226 million  \ncompared with $2.96 billion for the second    \nquarter of 2020. As of June 2021, headcount   \nwas essentially unchanged compared with March \n2021. Six Months Ended June 2021 versus June  \n2020. Operating expenses in the consolidated  \nstatements of earnings were $18.08 billion for\nthe first half of 2021, 7% higher than the    \nfirst half of 2020. Our efficiency ratio      \n(total operating expenses divided by total net\nrevenues) for the first half of 2021 was      \n54.6%, compared with 76.6% for the first half \nof 2020. In the first half of 2020, net       \nprovisions for litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings increased our efficiency ratio by \n14.3 percentage points. The increase in       \noperating expenses compared with the first    \nhalf of 2020 was due to significantly higher  \ncompensation and benefits expenses (reflecting\nstrong performance), partially offset by      \nsignificantly lower non-compensationexpenses. \nWithin non-compensationexpenses, net          \nprovisions for litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings were significantly lower,         \npartially offset by higher transaction based  \nexpenses and higher technology expenses       \n(included in communications and technology and\ndepreciation and amortization). Net provisions\nfor litigation and regulatory proceedings for \nthe first half of 2021 were $300 million      \ncompared with $3.14 billion for the first half\nof 2020. As of June 2021, headcount was       \nessentially unchanged compared with December  \n2020. Provision for Taxes The effective income\ntax rate for the first half of 2021 was 18.8%,\ndown from the full year income tax rate of    \n24.2% for 2020, primarily due to a decrease in\nprovisions for non-deductiblelitigation in the\nfirst half of 2021 compared with 2020. The    \nincrease compared with 18.0% for the first    \nquarter of 2021 was primarily due to a        \ndecrease in the impact of tax benefits on the \nsettlement of share-based awards in the first \nhalf of 2021 compared with the first quarter  \nof 2021. In March 2021, the American Rescue   \nPlan Act of 2021 (Rescue Plan) was signed into\nlaw. The Rescue Plan is a $1.9 trillion       \nstimulus package enacted to help address the  \neconomic and health impacts of the            \nCOVID-19pandemic. The Rescue Plan includes a  \nrepeal of a provision under which U.S.        \naffiliated groups could elect a worldwide     \nallocation of interest expense for foreign tax\ncredit limitation purposes for one year       \nbeginning in January 2021. Additionally,      \nbeginning in 2027, the limitation on corporate\ntax deductions for compensation payable to the\nCEO, CFO and the top three highest paid       \nemployees will be expanded to include the next\nfive highest paid employees. The legislation  \nis not expected to have a material impact on  \nour 2021 annual effective tax rate. In April  \n2021, the New York State (NYS) FY 2022 budget \nwas enacted. The legislation temporarily      \nincreased the NYS corporate income tax rate   \nfrom 6.5% to 7.25% for calendar years 2021    \nthrough 2023. The legislation is not expected \nto have a material impact on our 2021 annual  \neffective tax rate. The U.K. Finance Act 2021 \nwas enacted in June 2021 and includes a six   \npercent increase in the corporate income tax  \nrate effective from April 2023. During the    \nsecond quarter of 2021, U.K. deferred tax     \nassets and liabilities were remeasured and a  \ndeferred tax benefit of approximately $100    \nmillion was recognized. Following the increase\nin the U.K. corporate tax rate, the U.K.      \ngovernment has indicated that it will         \nundertake a review of the eight percent bank  \nsurcharge in order to ensure that the combined\ntax burden on banks does not rise             \nsubstantially. The results of the review,     \nincluding any changes to the bank surcharge,  \nwill be announced in the second half of 2021  \nand legislated as Finance Bill 2021-22.The    \nbank surcharge is currently applicable to     \ncertain of our U.K. subsidiaries and branches,\nincluding Goldman Sachs International (GSI)   \nand Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB).  \nFollowing Royal Assent, the associated impact \nof any change to the bank surcharge on U.K.   \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities could have\na material impact on our effective tax rate,  \ndepending on the operating results for the    \nquarter during which this legislation is      \nenacted. We expect our tax rate for the       \nremainder of 2021 to be approximately 21%,    \nexcluding the impact of any potential changes \nin current income tax rates.                  \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    106  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

During the second      \nquarter of 2021, Investment Banking operated  \nin an environment characterized by strong     \nindustry-wide activity across mergers and     \nacquisitions and underwriting, as the global  \neconomy continued to recover. In mergers and  \nacquisitions, industry-wide completed and     \nannounced transactions remained at high       \nlevels, reflecting supportive market          \nconditions and CEO confidence. In             \nunderwriting, industry-wide activity levels   \nreflected continued strength in equity        \nunderwriting, particularly in initial public  \nofferings, and debt underwriting, reflecting  \nelevated leveraged finance volumes. In the    \nfuture, if market and economic conditions     \ndeteriorate, and industry-wide mergers and    \nacquisitions transactions decline, or if      \nindustry-wide equity and debt underwriting    \nvolumes decline, or credit spreads related to \nhedges on our relationship lending portfolio  \ntighten, net revenues in Investment Banking   \nwould likely be negatively impacted. In       \naddition, a deterioration in the              \ncreditworthiness of borrowers would negatively\nimpact the provision for credit losses. Three \nMonths Ended June 2021 versus June 2020. Net  \nrevenues in Investment Banking were $3.61     \nbillion for the second quarter of 2021, 36%   \nhigher than the second quarter of 2020,       \nreflecting significantly higher net revenues  \nin Financial advisory and Corporate lending   \nand higher net revenues in Underwriting. The  \nincrease in Financial advisory net revenues   \nreflected an increase in completed mergers and\nacquisitions transactions. The increase in    \nCorporate lending net revenues primarily      \nreflected higher net interest income. The     \nincrease in Underwriting net revenues was due \nto higher net revenues in Equity underwriting,\nprimarily driven by strong industry-wide      \ninitial public offering activity, partially   \noffset by a significant decline in industry-  \nwide secondary offerings. Debt underwriting   \nnet revenues were slightly lower, primarily   \nreflecting significantly lower industry-wide  \ninvestment-grade volumes, partially offset by \nelevated industry-wide leveraged finance      \nvolumes. Provision for credit losses was a net\nbenefit of $107 million for the second quarter\nof 2021, compared with net provisions of $819 \nmillion for the second quarter of 2020,       \nprimarily due to reserve reductions reflecting\ncontinued improvement in the broader economic \nenvironment following challenging conditions  \nthat began in the first half of 2020.         \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    108  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

In this role, we seek to earn the\ndifference between the price at which a market\nparticipant is willing to sell an instrument  \nto us and the price at which another market   \nparticipant is willing to buy it from us, and \nvice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In       \naddition, we maintain (i) market-making       \npositions, typically for a short period of    \ntime, in response to, or in anticipation of,  \nclient demand, and (ii) positions to actively \nmanage our risk exposures that arise from     \nthese market-making activities (collectively, \ninventory). Our inventory is recorded in      \ntrading assets (long positions) or trading    \nliabilities (short positions) in our          \nconsolidated balance sheets. Our results are  \ninfluenced by a combination of interconnected \ndrivers, including (i) client activity levels \nand transactional bid/offer spreads           \n(collectively, client activity), and (ii)     \nchanges in the fair value of our inventory and\ninterest income and interest expense related  \nto the holding, hedging and funding of our    \ninventory (collectively, market-making        \ninventory changes). Due to the integrated     \nnature of our market-making activities,       \ndisaggregation of net revenues into client    \nactivity and market-making inventory changes  \nis judgmental and has inherent complexities   \nand limitations. The amount and composition of\nour net revenues vary over time as these      \ndrivers are impacted by multiple interrelated \nfactors affecting economic and market         \nconditions, including volatility and liquidity\nin the market, changes in interest rates,     \ncurrency exchange rates, credit spreads,      \nequity prices and commodity prices, investor  \nconfidence, and other macroeconomic concerns  \nand uncertainties. In general, assuming all   \nother market-making conditions remain         \nconstant, increases in client activity levels \nor bid/offer spreads tend to result in        \nincreases in net revenues, and decreases tend \nto have the opposite effect. However, changes \nin market-making conditions can materially    \nimpact client activity levels and bid/offer   \nspreads, as well as the fair value of our     \ninventory. For example, a decrease in         \nliquidity in the market could have the impact \nof (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii)  \ndecreasing investor confidence and thereby    \ndecreasing client activity levels, and (iii)  \nwidening of credit spreads on our inventory   \npositions.                                    \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    110  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nEnvironment. In the second quarter of 2021,   \nAsset Management benefitted from a supportive \noperating environment, as generally higher    \nglobal equity prices, optimism about the      \neconomic recovery and continued support from  \ncentral banks and governments globally        \nprovided a more favorable backdrop for asset  \nmanagement activities and investments. If     \noptimism about the economic outlook declines  \nor the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact \nof the COVID-19pandemic are ineffective, it   \nmay lead to a decline in asset prices,        \nwidening of credit spreads, and investors     \ntransitioning to asset classes that typically \ngenerate lower fees or investors withdrawing  \ntheir assets, and net revenues in Asset       \nManagement would likely be negatively         \nimpacted. Three Months Ended June 2021 versus \nJune 2020. Net revenues in Asset Management   \nwere $5.13 billion for the second quarter of  \n2021, more than double the amount in the      \nsecond quarter of 2020, primarily driven by   \nsignificantly higher net revenues in Equity   \ninvestments. In addition, Lending and debt    \ninvestments net revenues, Incentive fees and  \nManagement and other fees were each higher.   \nThe increase in Equity investments net        \nrevenues primarily reflected significantly    \nhigher net gains from investments in private  \nequities, driven by company-specific events,  \nincluding capital raises and sales, and       \nimproved corporate performance versus a       \nchallenging second quarter of 2020. The       \nincrease in Lending and debt investments net  \nrevenues was primarily due to higher net      \ninterest income. The increase in Incentive    \nfees was due to harvesting. Management and    \nother fees included the impact of higher      \naverage assets under supervision and higher   \nother fees, partially offset by fee waivers on\nmoney market funds. Provision for credit      \nlosses was a net benefit of $65 million for   \nthe second quarter of 2021, compared with net \nprovisions of $271 million for the second     \nquarter of 2020, primarily due to reserve     \nreductions reflecting continued improvement in\nthe broader economic environment following    \nchallenging conditions that began in the first\nhalf of 2020. Operating expenses were $1.94   \nbillion for the second quarter of 2021, 46%   \nhigher than the second quarter of 2020,       \nprimarily due to significantly higher         \ncompensation and benefits expenses (reflecting\nstrong performance). Pre-taxearnings were     \n$3.25 billion for the second quarter of 2021, \ncompared with $498 million for the second     \nquarter of 2020. Six Months Ended June 2021   \nversus June 2020. Net revenues in Asset       \nManagement were $9.75 billion for the first   \nhalf of 2021, compared with $2.01 billion for \nthe first half of 2020, driven by             \nsignificantly higher net revenues in Equity   \ninvestments and Lending and debt investments. \nManagement and other fees were higher, while  \nIncentive fees were lower. The increase in    \nEquity investments net revenues primarily     \nreflected significantly higher net gains from \ninvestments in private equities, driven by    \ncompany-specific events, including capital    \nraises and sales, and improved corporate      \nperformance versus a challenging first half of\n2020. In addition, net gains from investments \nin public equities were significantly higher, \nreflecting the impact of generally higher     \nglobal equity prices. Lending and debt        \ninvestments net revenues reflected net gains  \nacross debt investments for the first half of \n2021, reflecting generally tighter corporate  \ncredit spreads, compared with net losses for  \nthe first half of 2020. The increase in       \nManagement and other fees reflected the impact\nof higher average assets under supervision,   \npartially offset by fee waivers on money      \nmarket funds. The decrease in Incentive fees  \nwas driven by higher performance in the first \nhalf of 2020. Provision for credit losses was \na net benefit of $12 million for the first    \nhalf of 2021, compared with net provisions of \n$350 million for the first half of 2020,      \nprimarily due to reserve reductions reflecting\ncontinued improvement in the broader economic \nenvironment following challenging conditions  \nthat began in the first half of 2020.         \nOperating expenses were $3.83 billion for the \nfirst half of 2021, 52% higher than the first \nhalf of 2020, primarily due to significantly  \nhigher compensation and benefits expenses     \n(reflecting strong performance). Pre-         \ntaxearnings were $5.93 billion for the first  \nhalf of 2021, compared with a pre-taxloss of  \n$875 million for the first half of 2020.      \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    114  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

During the second quarter of     \n2021, improved market and economic conditions \ncontributed to a more favorable backdrop for  \nconsumer banking and wealth management        \nactivities. Global equity prices generally    \nincreased and, in the U.S., unemployment      \ndecreased and consumer spending increased     \ncompared with the first quarter of 2021, aided\nby optimism about the economic recovery and   \ncontinued support from central banks and      \ngovernments globally. If optimism about the   \neconomic outlook declines or the ongoing      \nefforts to mitigate the impact of the         \nCOVID-19pandemic are ineffective, it may lead \nto a decline in asset prices, investors       \nfavoring asset classes that typically generate\nlower fees, investors withdrawing their assets\nand consumers withdrawing their deposits or   \ndeterioration in consumer credit, and net     \nrevenues and the provision for credit losses  \nin Consumer & Wealth Management would likely  \nbe negatively impacted. Three Months Ended    \nJune 2021 versus June 2020. Net revenues in   \nConsumer & Wealth Management were $1.75       \nbillion for the second quarter of 2021, 28%   \nhigher than the second quarter of 2020. Net   \nrevenues in Wealth management were $1.38      \nbillion, 25% higher than the second quarter of\n2020. Management and other fees were higher,  \nreflecting the impact of higher average assets\nunder supervision, and net revenues in Private\nbanking and lending were higher, primarily    \nreflecting higher loan balances. Net revenues \nin Consumer banking were $363 million, 41%    \nhigher than the second quarter of 2020,       \nreflecting higher deposit and credit card     \nbalances. Provision for credit losses was $66 \nmillion for the second quarter of 2021, 79%   \nlower than the second quarter of 2020. The    \nsecond quarter of 2021 included provisions    \nrelated to growth in credit card loans,       \npartially offset by reserve reductions        \nreflecting continued improvement in the       \nbroader economic environment following        \nchallenging conditions that began in the first\nhalf of 2020. Operating expenses were $1.37   \nbillion for the second quarter of 2021, 14%   \nhigher than the second quarter of 2020,       \nprimarily due to higher compensation and      \nbenefits expenses (reflecting strong          \nperformance). Pre-taxearnings were $312       \nmillion for the second quarter of 2021,       \ncompared with a pre-taxloss of $155 million   \nfor the second quarter of 2020. Six Months    \nEnded June 2021 versus June 2020. Net revenues\nin Consumer & Wealth Management were $3.49    \nbillion for the first half of 2021, 22% higher\nthan the first half of 2020. Net revenues in  \nWealth management were $2.75 billion, 19%     \nhigher than the first half of 2020, due to    \nhigher Management and other fees, primarily   \nreflecting the impact of higher average assets\nunder supervision, and significantly higher   \nnet revenues in Private banking and lending,  \nprimarily reflecting higher loan balances,    \nwhile Incentive fees were lower. Net revenues \nin Consumer banking were $734 million, 36%    \nhigher than the first half of 2020, reflecting\nhigher deposit and credit card balances.      \nProvision for credit losses was $126 million  \nfor the first half of 2021, compared with $485\nmillion for the first half of 2020. The first \nhalf of 2021 included provisions for portfolio\ngrowth in credit cards, including $185 million\nof provisions related to the pending          \nacquisition of the General Motors co-         \nbrandedportfolio, partially offset by reserve \nreductions reflecting continued improvement in\nthe broader economic environment following    \nchallenging conditions that began in the first\nhalf of 2020. Operating expenses were $2.87   \nbillion for the first half of 2021, 17% higher\nthan the first half of 2020, primarily due to \nsignificantly higher compensation and benefits\nexpenses (reflecting strong performance). Pre-\ntaxearnings were $491 million for the first   \nhalf of 2021, compared with a pre-taxloss of  \n$75 million for the first half of 2020.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Our      \nstress tests incorporate our internally       \ndesigned stress scenarios, including our      \ninternally developed severely adverse         \nscenario, and those required by the FRB, and  \nare designed to capture our specific          \nvulnerabilities and risks. We provide further \ninformation about our stress test processes   \nand a summary of the results on our website as\ndescribed in \u201cAvailable Information.\u201d As      \nrequired by the FRB\u2019s CCAR rules, we submit an\nannual capital plan for review by the FRB. The\npurpose of the FRB\u2019s review is to ensure that \nwe have a robust, forward-looking capital     \nplanning process that accounts for our unique \nrisks and that permits continued operation    \nduring times of economic and financial stress.\nThe FRB evaluates us based, in part, on       \nwhether we have the capital necessary to      \ncontinue operating under the baseline and     \nseverely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB\nand those developed internally. This          \nevaluation also takes into account our process\nfor identifying risk, our controls and        \ngovernance for capital planning, and our      \nguidelines for making capital planning        \ndecisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our \nplan to make capital distributions (i.e.,     \ndividend payments and repurchases or          \nredemptions of stock, subordinated debt or    \nother capital securities) and issue capital,  \nacross the range of macroeconomic scenarios   \nand firm-specific assumptions. The FRB        \ndetermines the SCB applicable to us based on  \nits own annual stress test. The SCB under the \nStandardized approach is calculated as (i) the\ndifference between our starting and minimum   \nprojected CET1 capital ratios under the       \nsupervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii)\nour planned common stock dividends for each of\nthe fourth through seventh quarters of the    \nplanning horizon, expressed as a percentage of\nrisk-weighted assets (RWAs). We submitted our \n2021 CCAR capital plan in April 2021 and      \npublished a summary of our annual DFAST       \nresults in June 2021. See \u201cAvailable          \nInformation.\u201d Based on our 2021 CCAR          \nsubmission, the FRB has reduced our SCB from  \n6.6% to 6.4%, resulting in a Standardized CET1\ncapital ratio requirement of 13.4%, which will\nbe effective for the period from October 1,   \n2021 through September 30, 2022. See \u201cShare   \nRepurchase Program\u201d for further information   \nabout common stock repurchases and dividends. \nGS Bank USA has its own capital planning      \nprocess and, starting in 2022, will be        \nrequired to submit its annual stress test     \nresults to the FRB. GSI, GSIB and Goldman     \nSachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) also have their   \nown capital planning and stress testing       \nprocess, which incorporates internally        \ndesigned stress tests developed in accordance \nwith the guidelines of their respective       \nregulators. Contingency Capital Plan. As part \nof our comprehensive capital management       \npolicy, we maintain a contingency capital     \nplan. Our contingency capital plan provides a \nframework for analyzing and responding to a   \nperceived or actual capital deficiency,       \nincluding, but not limited to, identification \nof drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as\nmitigants and potential actions. It outlines  \nthe appropriate communication procedures to   \nfollow during a crisis period, including      \ninternal dissemination of information, as well\nas timely communication with external         \nstakeholders. Capital Attribution. We assess  \neach of our businesses\u2019 capital usage based on\nour internal assessment of risks, which       \nincorporates an attribution of our relevant   \nregulatory capital requirements. These        \nregulatory capital requirements are allocated \nusing our attributed equity framework, which  \ntakes into consideration our most binding     \ncapital constraints. Our most binding capital \nconstraint is based on the results of the     \nFRB\u2019s annual stress test, which includes the  \nStandardized risk-based capital and leverage  \nratios. We review and make any necessary      \nadjustments to our attributed equity framework\neach year, in January, to reflect our final   \nCCAR results from the prior year. On January  \n1, 2021, we adjusted our attributed equity    \nframework to reflect the results of our 2020  \nCCAR submission. The adjusted attributed      \nequity framework places greater emphasis on   \nactivities that generate significant stress   \nlosses and higher Standardized risk weights.  \nAs a result of this adjustment, relative to   \nthe allocation as of December 2020, the       \nallocation of attributed equity among our     \nsegments at the start of this year changed as \nfollows: attributed equity increased by       \napproximately $3.7 billion for Asset          \nManagement and approximately $0.7 billion for \nConsumer & Wealth Management, while attributed\nequity decreased by approximately $2.3 billion\nfor Global Markets and approximately $2.1     \nbillion for Investment Banking. See \u201cSegment  \nAssets and Operating Results \u2014 Segment        \nOperating Results\u201d for information about our  \naverage quarterly attributed equity by        \nsegment. Share Repurchase Program. We use our \nshare repurchase program to help maintain the \nappropriate level of common equity. The       \nrepurchase program is effected primarily      \nthrough regular open-market purchases (which  \nmay include repurchase plans designed to      \ncomply with Rule 10b5-1and accelerated share  \nrepurchases), the amounts and timing of which \nare determined primarily by our current and   \nprojected capital position and our capital    \nplan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The\namounts and timing of the repurchases may also\nbe influenced by general market conditions and\nthe prevailing price and trading volumes of   \nour common stock.                             \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    124  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis During   \nthe first half of 2021, large bank holding    \ncompanies (BHCs) were subject to the          \nCOVID-19-relatedrestrictions by the FRB that  \nlimited the amount of stock repurchases and   \ncommon stock dividends to the average net     \nincome of the BHC over the prior four quarters\nand precluded BHCs from increasing common     \nstock dividends. These restrictions ceased on \nJuly 1, 2021. During the second quarter of    \n2021, we returned a total of $1.44 billion to \nshareholders, including common stock          \nrepurchases of $1.0 billion and $441 million  \nin common stock dividends. Consistent with our\ncapital management philosophy and in          \nrecognition of attractive capital deployment  \nopportunities, we lowered our stock           \nrepurchases in the second quarter of 2021     \ncompared with the first quarter of 2021. The  \nBoard of Directors of Group Inc. (Board)      \napproved an increase in our common stock      \ndividend from $1.25 to $2.00 per share        \nbeginning in the third quarter of 2021. We    \nwill continue deploying capital in our        \nbusiness where returns are attractive. As of  \nJune 2021, the remaining share authorization  \nunder our existing repurchase program was 38.1\nmillion shares. See \u201cUnregistered Sales of    \nEquity Securities and Use of Proceeds\u201d in Part\nII, Item 2 of this Form 10-Qand Note 19 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about our share repurchase        \nprogram, and see above for information about  \nour capital planning and stress testing       \nprocess. Resolution Capital Models. In        \nconnection with our resolution planning       \nefforts, we have established a Resolution     \nCapital Adequacy and Positioning framework,   \nwhich is designed to ensure that our major    \nsubsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co.\nLLC (GS&Co.), GSI, GSIB, GSBE, Goldman Sachs  \nJapan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset  \nManagement, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Asset      \nManagement International) have access to      \nsufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the    \nform of equity, subordinated debt and         \nunsecured senior debt) so that they are able  \nto wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy\nfiling in accordance with our preferred       \nresolution strategy. In addition, we have     \nestablished a triggers and alerts framework,  \nwhich is designed to provide the Board with   \ninformation needed to make an informed        \ndecision on whether and when to commence      \nbankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc. Rating  \nAgency Guidelines The credit rating agencies  \nassign credit ratings to the obligations of   \nGroup Inc., which directly issues or          \nguarantees substantially all of our senior    \nunsecured debt obligations. GS&Co. and GSI    \nhave been assigned long- and short-term issuer\nratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS \nBank USA, GSIB and GSBE have also been        \nassigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, \nas well as ratings on their long- and short-  \nterm bank deposits. In addition, credit rating\nagencies have assigned ratings to debt        \nobligations of certain other subsidiaries of  \nGroup Inc. The level and composition of our   \nequity capital are among the many factors     \nconsidered in determining our credit ratings. \nEach agency has its own definition of eligible\ncapital and methodology for evaluating capital\nadequacy, and assessments are generally based \non a combination of factors rather than a     \nsingle calculation.

Consolidated Regulatory Capital We   \nare subject to consolidated regulatory capital\nrequirements which are calculated in          \naccordance with the regulations of the FRB    \n(Capital Framework).

The capital requirements calculated  \nunder the Capital Framework include the       \ncapital conservation buffer requirements,     \nwhich are comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under   \nthe Advanced Capital Rules), the SCB (under   \nthe Standardized Capital Rules), a            \ncountercyclical capital buffer (under both    \nCapital Rules) and the G-SIBsurcharge (under  \nboth Capital Rules). Our G-SIBsurcharge is    \n2.5% for 2021 and 2022. We expect that our    \nG-SIBsurcharge will be 3.0% beginning in 2023.\nBased on financial data for the six months    \nended June 2021, our current estimate is that \nwe are above the threshold for the 3.5%       \nG-SIBsurcharge. The earliest this surcharge   \ncould be effective is January 2024. The       \nG-SIBsurcharge and countercyclical capital    \nbuffer in the future may differ due to        \nadditional guidance from our regulators and/or\npositional changes, and our SCB is likely to  \nchange from year to year based on the results \nof the annual supervisory stress tests. Our   \ntarget Standardized CET1 capital ratio remains\nin a range between 13.0% and 13.5% (including \nmanagement buffers) based upon the execution  \nof our previously announced strategic         \ninitiatives and achievement of capital        \nefficiencies. However, in light of our most   \nrecent SCB based on our 2021 CCAR submission, \nachieving this target by year-end 2022 will be\nchallenging. See Note 20 to the consolidated  \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout our risk-based capital ratios and       \nleverage ratios, and the Capital Framework.   \nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) We are   \nalso subject to the FRB\u2019s TLAC and related    \nrequirements. Failure to comply with the TLAC \nand related requirements could result in      \nrestrictions being imposed by the FRB and     \ncould limit our ability to repurchase shares, \npay dividends and make certain discretionary  \ncompensation payments.                        \n                                            \n  125    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

GSI had\na leverage ratio of 4.2% as of June 2021 and  \n4.7% as of December 2020.

These profits contributed     \napproximately 5 basis points to the leverage  \nratio. This leverage ratio is based on our    \ncurrent interpretation and understanding of   \nthis rule and may evolve as we discuss the    \ninterpretation and application of the U.K.    \nleverage ratio framework with GSI\u2019s           \nregulators. GSI is also subject to a minimum  \nrequirement for own funds and eligible        \nliabilities issued to affiliates. This        \nrequirement is subject to a transitional      \nperiod which began to phase in from January   \n2019 and will become fully effective beginning\nin January 2022. As of both June 2021 and     \nDecember 2020, GSI was in compliance with this\nrequirement. GSJCL, our Japanese broker-      \ndealer, is regulated by Japan\u2019s Financial     \nServices Agency. GSJCL and certain other      \nnon-U.S.subsidiaries are also subject to      \ncapital requirements promulgated by           \nauthorities of the countries in which they    \noperate.

In     \nApril 2021, the State of New York approved    \nlegislation which minimizes legal and economic\nuncertainty for contracts that are governed by\nNew York law and have no fallback provisions  \nor have fallback provisions that are based on \nLIBOR by providing a statutory framework to   \nreplace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on  \nthe Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).  \nThe U.S. federal banking agencies have also   \nissued guidance strongly encouraging banking  \norganizations to cease using USD LIBOR as a   \nreference rate in new contracts as soon as    \npracticable and in any event by December 31,  \n2021. The International Swaps and Derivatives \nAssociation (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks        \nProtocol (IBOR Protocol), which became        \neffective in January 2021, provides           \nderivatives market participants with amended  \nfallbacks for legacy and new derivatives      \ncontracts to mitigate legal or economic       \nuncertainty. Both counterparties will have to \nadhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in      \nbilateral amendments for the terms to be      \neffective for derivative contracts. ISDA      \nconfirmed that the FCA\u2019s formal announcement  \nin March 2021 fixed the spread adjustment for \nall LIBOR rates and that fallbacks will       \nautomatically occur for outstanding           \nderivatives contracts that incorporate the    \nrelevant terms. We have a program in place    \nthat focuses on achieving an orderly          \ntransition from IBORs to alternative risk-free\nreference rates for us and our clients, and   \ncontinue to make progress on our transition   \nprogram. As part of this transition, we       \ncontinue to actively engage with our          \nregulators and clients, as well as participate\nin central bank and sector working groups. The\nmajority of our LIBOR risk exposure is to USD \nLIBOR, which is primarily in connection with  \nour derivative contracts and to a lesser      \nextent our unsecured debt, preferred stock and\nloan portfolio. For non-USDLIBOR,             \nsubstantially all of our risk exposure is in  \nconnection with derivative contracts. Our     \nderivative contracts are primarily with       \ncounterparties under bilateral agreements     \nwhich adhere to the IBOR Protocol or with     \ncentral clearing counterparties which have    \nincorporated fallbacks consistent with the    \nIBOR Protocol in their rule books and have    \nannounced that they plan to convert all LIBOR \ncontracts to alternative risk-free reference  \nrates before LIBOR cessation. We continue to  \nmonitor the potential legislative developments\nas they relate to unsecured debt and preferred\nstock and will take actions designed to       \nfacilitate an orderly transition. We are also \nengaged with our clients in order to remediate\nour loan agreements through bilateral         \namendments. We have also issued debt and      \ndeposits linked to SOFR and Sterling Overnight\nIndex Average (SONIA) and executed SOFR- and  \nSONIA-based derivative contracts to make      \nmarkets and facilitate client activities. When\nappropriate, we continue to execute           \ntransactions in the market to reduce our LIBOR\nexposures arising from hedges to our fixed-   \nrate debt issuances and replace with          \nalternative reference rate exposures.

Impact of COVID-19Pandemic. During   \nthe second quarter of 2021, the economic      \nrecovery gained significant traction in       \ncountries in which comprehensive vaccination  \nprograms have led to the lifting of health and\nsafety restrictions, such as the U.S. and     \nChina. However, other countries encountered   \nmore challenging circumstances as a result of \nslower distribution of vaccines and the spread\nof new variants, most notably the Delta       \nvariant.                                      \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    128  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis We have  \ncontinued to successfully execute on our      \nBusiness Continuity Planning (BCP) strategy   \nsince initially activating it in the first    \nquarter of 2020 in response to the emergence  \nof the COVID-19pandemic. Our priority has been\nto safeguard our employees and to seek to     \nensure continuity of business operations on   \nbehalf of our clients. Our business continuity\nresponse to the COVID-19pandemic is managed by\na central team, which is led by our chief     \nadministrative officer and chief medical      \nofficer, and includes senior management within\nRisk and the chief operating officers across  \nall regions and businesses. Given that the    \nsituation regarding COVID-19varies            \ngeographically, our approach to transitioning \nback to the office is tailored to the         \ncircumstances of each location, and it evolves\nas the specific conditions and requirements of\neach location change. During the second       \nquarter of 2021, we formally welcomed         \nemployees back to our offices in New York,    \nDallas, Salt Lake City, Hong Kong and other   \nlocations, and approximately 50% of employees \nin these offices have since been working from \nthe office on a regular basis. Going forward, \nwe will look to re-openmore locations         \nconsistent with the health and safety         \nguidelines of each city in which we operate.  \nOur systems and infrastructure have been      \nrobust throughout the COVID-19pandemic,       \nenabling us to conduct our activities without \ndisruption. Communication throughout our      \norganization has remained active during the   \npandemic and our risk management processes    \nhave continued to operate in a rigorous and   \ndisciplined manner. From the onset of the     \npandemic, our people have stayed connected    \nwith our clients. In addition, as part of our \nvendor management processes, we have ongoing  \ndialogues with third-party service providers, \nwhich are intended to ensure that they        \ncontinue to meet our criteria for business    \ncontinuity. We maintained high liquidity      \nlevels during the second quarter of 2021, as  \nour GCLA averaged $329 billion. We have       \ncontinued to access our traditional funding   \nsources in the normal course and service our  \ndebt and other obligations on a timely basis. \nOur unsecured long-term borrowings increased  \nby $20 billion during the second quarter of   \n2021, driven by the issuance of $18 billion of\nour benchmark debt to support the growth in   \nour total assets amid client demand and       \nattractive return opportunities. We expect to \ncontinue this issuance if accretive           \nopportunities requiring non-bankfunding       \npersist. However, we expect that the pace of  \nour issuance will moderate relative to the    \nfirst half of 2021. See \u201cBalance Sheet and    \nFunding Sources\u201d and \u201cRisk Management \u2014       \nLiquidity Risk Management\u201d for further        \ninformation. Accounting estimates,            \nparticularly those made in connection with    \ndetermining the allowance for credit losses   \nand the fair value of certain level 3 assets, \nare sensitive to assumptions regarding future \neconomic conditions. Predicting the trajectory\nof the economic recovery is highly judgmental \ngiven the uncertainty as to how the pandemic  \nwill evolve, as it will largely depend on the \nspeed and extent of further vaccine           \ndistribution and the impact of the Delta      \nvariant or other variants that might arise.   \nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial      \nstatements for further information about our  \nallowance for credit losses and Note 4 to the \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about fair value measurements.    \nFinancial markets remained constructive during\nthe second quarter of 2021, and although      \ntrading volumes and volatility moderated,     \nclient activity was still solid. We continued \nto deploy our balance sheet to intermediate   \nrisk and to support client activity. Our      \naverage daily Value-at-Risk(VaR) for the      \nsecond quarter of 2021 was essentially        \nunchanged compared with the first quarter of  \n2021. We have maintained our proactive        \napproach to managing market risk levels, which\nentails ongoing review and monitoring of      \nexposures and focusing on ways to mitigate    \nrisk. As a result of the improved broader     \neconomic backdrop, credit risk in general has \nabated from the depths of the pandemic,       \nincluding the risk associated with industries \nthat were most severely impacted by lockdowns,\nsuch as hospitality and airlines. However, the\npotential exists for the Delta variant or     \nother variants to impede the recovery and we  \ncontinue to closely monitor our exposures to  \nindustries that would be most negatively      \nimpacted by a resurgence in the pandemic. See \n\u201cRisk Management \u2014 Market Risk Management\u201d and\n\u201c\u2014 Credit Risk Management\u201d for further        \ninformation. Although progress in the fight   \nagainst the COVID-19pandemic has occurred     \nunevenly across regions and countries since   \nvaccines first became available, optimism     \nregarding the continued rebound of the global \neconomy remains high. However, if progress    \ntoward an end to the pandemic were to stall or\nreverse and a sustained period of weak        \neconomic conditions were to ensue, our        \nbusinesses would be adversely impacted. This  \nwould have a negative impact on factors that  \nare important to our operating performance,   \nsuch as the level of client activity,         \ncreditworthiness of counterparties and        \nborrowers, and the amount of our AUS. We will \ncontinue to closely monitor the rollout of    \nvaccines across regions, as well as the impact\nof new variants of the virus, and will take   \nfurther actions, as necessary, in order to    \nbest serve the interests of our employees,    \nclients and counterparties.

Overview and        \nStructure of Risk Management Overview We      \nbelieve that effective risk management is     \ncritical to our success. Accordingly, we have \nestablished an enterprise risk management     \nframework that employs a comprehensive,       \nintegrated approach to risk management, and is\ndesigned to enable comprehensive risk         \nmanagement processes through which we         \nidentify, assess, monitor and manage the risks\nwe assume in conducting our activities. Our   \nrisk management structure is built around     \nthree core components: governance, processes  \nand people. Governance. Risk management       \ngovernance starts with the Board, which both  \ndirectly and through its committees, including\nits Risk Committee, oversees our risk         \nmanagement policies and practices implemented \nthrough the enterprise risk management        \nframework. The Board is also responsible for  \nthe annual review and approval of our risk    \nappetite statement. The risk appetite         \nstatement describes the levels and types of   \nrisk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in \norder to achieve our objectives included in   \nour strategic business plan, while remaining  \nin compliance with regulatory requirements.   \nThe Board reviews our strategic business plan \nand is ultimately responsible for overseeing  \nand providing direction about our strategy and\nrisk appetite.                                \n                                            \n  131    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Our Intraday        \nLiquidity Model measures our intraday         \nliquidity needs using a scenario analysis     \ncharacterized by the same qualitative elements\nas our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model   \nassesses the risk of increased intraday       \nliquidity requirements during a scenario where\naccess to sources of intraday liquidity may   \nbecome constrained. Long-Term Stress Testing. \nWe utilize longer-term stress tests to take a \nforward view on our liquidity position through\nprolonged stress periods in which we          \nexperience a severe liquidity stress and      \nrecover in an environment that continues to be\nchallenging. We are focused on ensuring       \nconservative asset-liability management to    \nprepare for a prolonged period of potential   \nstress, seeking to maintain a diversified     \nfunding profile with an appropriate tenor,    \ntaking into consideration the characteristics \nand liquidity profile of our assets.          \nResolution Liquidity Models. In connection    \nwith our resolution planning efforts, we have \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy \nand Positioning framework, which estimates    \nliquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a\nstressed environment. The liquidity needs are \nmeasured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow  \nassumptions and include certain additional    \ninter-affiliate exposures. We have also       \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Execution\nNeed framework, which measures the liquidity  \nneeds of our major subsidiaries to stabilize  \nand wind-down following a Group Inc.          \nbankruptcy filing in accordance with our      \npreferred resolution strategy. In addition, we\nhave established a triggers and alerts        \nframework, which is designed to provide the   \nBoard with information needed to make an      \ninformed decision on whether and when to      \ncommence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\nLimits We use liquidity risk limits at various\nlevels and across liquidity risk types to     \nmanage the size of our liquidity exposures.   \nLimits are measured relative to acceptable    \nlevels of risk given our liquidity risk       \ntolerance. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for information about the limit   \napproval process. Limits are monitored by     \nTreasury and Liquidity Risk.

Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow   \nand Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a    \nrequirement for Group Inc., as well as a      \nstandalone requirement for each of our major  \nbroker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding  \nIHC is required to provide the necessary      \nliquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary   \ncourse of business, and is also obligated to  \nprovide capital and liquidity support to major\nsubsidiaries in the event of our material     \nfinancial distress or failure. Liquidity held \ndirectly in each of our major broker-dealer   \nand bank subsidiaries is intended for use only\nby that subsidiary to meet its liquidity      \nrequirements and is assumed not to be         \navailable to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless \n(i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no\nadditional regulatory, tax or other           \nrestrictions. In addition, the Modeled        \nLiquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model\nalso incorporate a broader assessment of      \nstandalone liquidity requirements for other   \nsubsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA\ndirectly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to      \nsupport such requirements. Other Unencumbered \nAssets. In addition to our GCLA, we have a    \nsignificant amount of other unencumbered cash \nand financial instruments, including other    \ngovernment obligations, high-grade money      \nmarket securities, corporate obligations,     \nmarginable equities, loans and cash deposits  \nnot included in our GCLA. The fair value of   \nour unencumbered assets averaged $249.61      \nbillion for the three months ended June 2021  \nand $224.01 billion for the three months ended\nMarch 2021. We do not consider these assets   \nliquid enough to be eligible for our GCLA.    \nLiquidity Regulatory Framework As a BHC, we   \nare subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage   \nRatio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the\nU.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR\nrule requires organizations to maintain an    \nadequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows   \nunder an acute, short-term liquidity stress   \nscenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by \nsubsidiaries that is in excess of their       \nminimum requirement and is subject to transfer\nrestrictions.

VaR    \nexcludes the impact of changes in counterparty\ncredit spreads, our own credit spreads and    \nunsecured funding spreads on derivatives, as  \nwell as changes in our own credit spreads     \n(debt valuation adjustment) on financial      \nliabilities for which the fair value option   \nwas elected. The estimated sensitivity to a   \none basis point increase in credit spreads    \n(counterparty and our own) and unsecured      \nfunding spreads on derivatives (including     \nhedges) was a loss of $2 million as of both   \nJune 2021 and March 2021. In addition, the    \nestimated sensitivity to a one basis point    \nincrease in our own credit spreads on         \nfinancial liabilities for which the fair value\noption was elected was a gain of $31 million  \nas of June 2021 and $28 million as of March   \n2021. However, the actual net impact of a     \nchange in our own credit spreads is also      \naffected by the liquidity, duration and       \nconvexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to\nchanges in yields) of those financial         \nliabilities for which the fair value option   \nwas elected, as well as the relative          \nperformance of any hedges undertaken. Interest\nRate Sensitivity. Loans accounted for at      \namortized cost were $116.04 billion as of June\n2021 and $104.60 billion as of March 2021,    \nsubstantially all of which had floating       \ninterest rates. The estimated sensitivity to a\n100 basis point increase in interest rates on \nsuch loans was $826 million as of June 2021   \nand $808 million as of March 2021 of          \nadditional interest income over a twelve-month\nperiod, which does not take into account the  \npotential impact of an increase in costs to   \nfund such loans.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Our      \ncredit risk management systems capture credit \nexposure to individual counterparties and on  \nan aggregate basis to counterparties and their\nsubsidiaries. These systems also provide      \nmanagement with comprehensive information     \nabout our aggregate credit risk by product,   \ninternal credit rating, industry, country and \nregion. Risk Measures We measure our credit   \nrisk based on the potential loss in the event \nof non-paymentby a counterparty using current \nand potential exposure. For derivatives and   \nsecurities financing transactions, current    \nexposure represents the amount presently owed \nto us after taking into account applicable    \nnetting and collateral arrangements, while    \npotential exposure represents our estimate of \nthe future exposure that could arise over the \nlife of a transaction based on market         \nmovements within a specified confidence level.\nPotential exposure also takes into account    \nnetting and collateral arrangements. For loans\nand lending commitments, the primary measure  \nis a function of the notional amount of the   \nposition. Stress Tests We conduct regular     \nstress tests to calculate the credit          \nexposures, including potential concentrations \nthat would result from applying shocks to     \ncounterparty credit ratings or credit risk    \nfactors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates,\nequity prices). These shocks cover a wide     \nrange of moderate and more extreme market     \nmovements, including shocks to multiple risk  \nfactors, consistent with the occurrence of a  \nsevere market or economic event. In the case  \nof sovereign default, we estimate the direct  \nimpact of the default on our sovereign credit \nexposures, changes to our credit exposures    \narising from potential market moves in        \nresponse to the default, and the impact of    \ncredit market deterioration on corporate      \nborrowers and counterparties that may result  \nfrom the sovereign default. Unlike potential  \nexposure, which is calculated within a        \nspecified confidence level, stress testing    \ndoes not generally assume a probability of    \nthese events occurring. We also perform       \nfirmwide stress tests. See \u201cOverview and      \nStructure of Risk Management\u201d for information \nabout firmwide stress tests. To supplement    \nthese regular stress tests, as described      \nabove, we also conduct tailored stress tests  \non an ad hoc basis in response to specific    \nmarket events that we deem significant. We    \nalso utilize these stress tests to estimate   \nthe indirect impact of certain hypothetical   \nevents on our country exposures, such as the  \nimpact of credit market deterioration on      \ncorporate borrowers and counterparties along  \nwith the shocks to the risk factors described \nabove. The parameters of these shocks vary    \nbased on the scenario reflected in each stress\ntest. We review estimated losses produced by  \nthe stress tests in order to understand their \nmagnitude, highlight potential loss           \nconcentrations, and assess and mitigate our   \nexposures where necessary. Limits We use      \ncredit risk limits at various levels, as well \nas underwriting standards to manage the size  \nand nature of our credit exposures. Limits for\nindustries and countries are based on our risk\nappetite and are designed to allow for regular\nmonitoring, review, escalation and management \nof credit risk concentrations. See \u201cOverview  \nand Structure of Risk Management\u201d for         \ninformation about the limit approval process. \nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring     \nthese limits, and identifying and escalating  \nto senior management and/or the appropriate   \nrisk committee, on a timely basis, instances  \nwhere limits have been exceeded. Risk         \nMitigants To reduce our credit exposures on   \nderivatives and securities financing          \ntransactions, we may enter into netting       \nagreements with counterparties that permit us \nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. We may also reduce credit risk\nwith counterparties by entering into          \nagreements that enable us to obtain collateral\nfrom them on an upfront or contingent basis   \nand/or to terminate transactions if the       \ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating falls below a    \nspecified level. We monitor the fair value of \nthe collateral to ensure that our credit      \nexposures are appropriately collateralized. We\nseek to minimize exposures where there is a   \nsignificant positive correlation between the  \ncreditworthiness of our counterparties and the\nmarket value of collateral we receive. For    \nloans and lending commitments, depending on   \nthe credit quality of the borrower and other  \ncharacteristics of the transaction, we employ \na variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk   \nmitigants include collateral provisions,      \nguarantees, covenants, structural seniority of\nthe bank loan claims and, for certain lending \ncommitments, provisions in the legal          \ndocumentation that allow us to adjust loan    \namounts, pricing, structure and other terms as\nmarket conditions change. The type and        \nstructure of risk mitigants employed can      \nsignificantly influence the degree of credit  \nrisk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into\na counterparty\u2019s financial strength or when we\nbelieve a counterparty requires support from  \nits parent, we may obtain third-party         \nguarantees of the counterparty\u2019s obligations. \nWe may also mitigate our credit risk using    \ncredit derivatives or participation           \nagreements.                                   \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    148  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Statements about the progress or \nthe status of remediation activities relating \nto 1MDB are based on our expectations         \nregarding our current remediation plans.      \nAccordingly, our ability to complete the      \nremediation activities may change, possibly   \nmaterially, from what is currently expected.  \nStatements about our objectives in management \nof our human capital, including our diversity \ngoals, are based on our current expectations  \nand are subject to the risk that we may not   \nachieve these objectives and goals due to,    \namong other things, competition in recruiting \nand attracting diverse candidates and         \nunsuccessful efforts in retaining diverse     \nemployees. Statements about our plans for our \npeople to return to our offices are based on  \nour current expectations and that return may  \nbe delayed due to, among other factors, future\nevents that are unpredictable, including the  \ncourse of the COVID-19pandemic, responses of  \ngovernmental authorities and the availability,\nuse and effectiveness of vaccines.
