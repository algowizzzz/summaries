The firm delivered record\nfinancial performance, announced two strategic\nacquisitions, added two new independent\ndirectors and began to bring our people back\ntogether in person. In carrying out its work,\nour Board met actively throughout 2021, with\n78 Board and committee meetings, and for me,\nas Lead Director, an additional 55 meetings,\ncalls and engagements with the firm and our\npeople, our shareholders, regulators and other\nstakeholders, including meetings with\nshareholders representing over 25% of our\nshares outstanding. The firm\u0092s performance in\n2021 was extraordinary, with records set\nacross a variety of firmwide and divisional\nmetrics. As a Board, we view these results as\na testament to management\u0092s ability to set out\na clear strategic direction and execute on it\nto deliver for our shareholders, supported by\nthe dedication and quality of our people\nacross all levels of the organization, and\ncreating strong momentum for the future. It\nwould be easy in a year such as this to focus\nsolely on these record financial results, but\nto do so would not be fulfilling our\nfundamental role as a Board as stewards of our\nshareholders\u0092 interests. We have also focused\non how these results were achieved\u0097 as it is\nthrough furtherance of our culture and core\nvalues, sound risk management and execution of\nour people strategy that we will create\nenduring success for our clients and our\ncommunities, and long-term sustainable value\nfor our shareholders. This ethos remained at\nthe core of the work of our Board and its\ncommittees in 2021 as we engaged with David\nSolomon, John Waldron and the broader senior\nmanagement team on the key drivers and risks\nrelating to the execution of our strategy on a\nfirmwide, divisional and regional level. This\nincluded regular updates on the firm\u0092s\nexecution priorities and organizational\nhealth, review and approval of the firm\u0092s\nstrategic acquisitions, the tracking of key\nperformance indicators, and a focus on how\nmanagement is driving continued progress,\naddressing the inevitable obstacles and\nplanning for the next phase of the firm\u0092s\ngrowth strategy. Strategy, and the execution\nthereof, will remain top of mind for our Board\nin the coming year, and as David communicated\nduring his February 2022 strategic update, the\nfirm remains committed to its strategy to\noperate with a growth mindset, strengthen our\nbusinesses over the medium and long term, and\nproduce consistent, durable returns. We\nbelieve that the firm is well-positioned to\nexecute on its goals, and as a Board, we will\ncontinue to hold management accountable for\ndoing so. While driving long-term shareholder\nvalue remains a top focus, that does not\ndiminish the importance we place on driving\nvalue for our other stakeholders as well.\nSustainability \u0096 which the firm defines\nthrough its commitments to advance climate\ntransition and inclusive growth \u0096 remained top\nof mind for us during 2021. Sustainability is\nnot a buzz word for our Board or the firm, but\nrather encapsulates all that we do for our\nclients, our communities and ultimately, you,\nas our shareholders. Whether it be the launch\nof One Million Black Women, the issuance of\nthe firm\u0092s first sustainability bond, the\nannouncement of a net zero commitment and\ninterim decarbonization targets, or the next\nphase of corporate engagement programs such as\n10,000 Small Businesses, sustainability\nconsiderations continue to be central to our\nBoard and committee oversight and discussions.\nWe also continued to engage with management as\nthe firm makes the necessary investments for\ncontinued growth. Importantly, this includes\ninvesting not only in our businesses and\ntechnology, but in the firm\u0092s people. To this\nend, we continued our focus on the firm\u0092s\npeople strategy with respect to immediate\ntasks such as supporting our people through\nthe ongoing pandemic and developing an\nappropriate return to office strategy. We are\nalso maintaining our focus on fundamental\nconsiderations and priorities such as our\ncontinued progress around diversity, inclusion\nand equity, the development of the firm\u0092s\n\u0093next generation\u0094 of leaders and the firm\u0092s\nbroader people strategy goals around\nattracting and retaining talent, sustaining\nour culture and broadening our impact. Success\nin each of these areas, including the\nstrength, depth and diversity of our\nleadership bench, will be paramount to our\nlong-term success.\n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2022         |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    iii  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nLETTER FROM OUR LEAD DIRECTOR In this regard,\nthe highly competitive market for talent was\nalso a key focus during 2021. An important\nresponsibility for our Compensation Committee\nand Board is putting in place an executive\ncompensation program that appropriately\nreflects the firm\u0092s pay for performance\nculture and provides rigorous alignment across\nour senior leadership team with long-term\nshareholder value creation. This past year we\ntook two key actions in furtherance of this\nresponsibility. First, we expanded the use of\nperformance-based equity compensation for\nmembers of our Management Committee, so that\nour annual incentive structure is aligned\nacross our most senior leaders. Second, we\ngranted one-time Shareholder Value Creation\nAwards to David, John and the members of our\nManagement Committee. These awards, which have\na five-year performance period and rigorous\nTSR-based thresholds, are designed to respond\nto the competitive pressures we face to retain\nour top talent and ensure continuity in our\nsenior leadership over the next phase of the\nfirm\u0092s growth strategy while also further\naligning pay outcomes with long-term\nshareholder value creation. More information\nabout our 2021 annual compensation decisions\nas well as the Shareholder Value Creations\nAwards is included in this Proxy Statement. In\naddition, I cannot mention the firm\u0092s\nleadership team without thanking Stephen\nScherr for his outstanding service over his\nnearly three-decade long career with the firm.\nOur Board had the opportunity to engage with\nStephen for almost a decade, as chief strategy\nofficer, head of the then Consumer &\nCommercial Banking Division and most recently\nas Chief Financial Officer. Stephen\nexemplifies the firm\u0092s core values and made\nlasting contributions to the firm, not the\nleast of which includes his focus on ensuring\na smooth and successful transition to Denis\nColeman as Chief Financial Officer. Denis\nembodies the next generation of the firm\u0092s\nleadership, and we look forward to working\nwith him in his new role. As I emphasize to\nyou each year, we continue our regular reviews\nof our Board composition, as well as our\ngovernance processes, to help ensure that our\nBoard has an appropriate and diverse mix and\nbalance of skills and experiences, strong\nindependent leadership, and sound governance\nprocesses so that we can effectively carry out\nour responsibilities, including those\ndescribed above and elsewhere in this Proxy\nStatement. To this end, during 2021, we\nwelcomed two new directors to our Board,\nreviewed our leadership structure, enhanced\nour annual Board evaluation process and\nreviewed our various governance policies and\npractices. We were pleased to add Jessica Uhl,\nwho recently announced her retirement as CFO\nof Shell plc, who was elected by shareholders\nat our 2021 annual meeting and joined our\nBoard in July 2021, and Kimberley Harris,\nExecutive Vice President of Comcast\nCorporation and Executive Vice President and\nGeneral Counsel of NBCUniversal, who was\nappointed to our Board in May 2021. Jessica\nand Kim have already made strong contributions\nto our Board and its committees, and we look\nforward to their continued insights. Lastly,\nas part of our Board succession planning, and\ntaking into account feedback received in\nconnection with our Board evaluation process,\nwe have asked Mark Winkelman, who recently\nturned 75, to stand for re-election at our\n2022 Annual Meeting for one additional term.\nMark has been an exceptional Chair of our Risk\nCommittee, and we have benefited immensely\nfrom his judgment, counsel and depth of\nexpertise. On behalf of our Board, I am\ngrateful for your ongoing support of our Board\nand the firm. We value your investment and our\nongoing engagement, which informs our work. I\nlook forward to continuing our dialogue in the\nyear to come.

             \nProcess for Independence Assessment A director\nis considered independent under NYSE rules if\nour Board determines that the director does\nnot have any direct or indirect material\nrelationship with Goldman Sachs. Our Board has\nestablished a Director Independence Policy\nthat provides standards to assist our Board in\ndetermining which relationships and\ntransactions might constitute a material\nrelationship that would cause a director not\nto be independent. To assess independence, our\nGovernance Committee and our Board review\ndetailed information regarding our independent\ndirectors or nominees, including employment\nand public company and not-for-\nprofitdirectorships, as well as information\nregarding immediate family members and\naffiliated entities. Through the course of\nthis review, our Governance Committee and our\nBoard consider relationships between the\nindependent directors or nominees (and their\nimmediate family members and affiliated\nentities) on the one hand, and Goldman Sachs\nand its affiliates on the other, in accordance\nwith our Director Independence Policy. This\nincludes a review of revenues to the firm\nfrom, and payments or donations made by us to,\nrelevant entities affiliated with our\ndirectors or nominees (or their immediate\nfamily members) as a result of ordinary course\ntransactions or contributions to not-for-\nprofitorganizations.

The review considered a\nvariety of factors, including our governance\npractices and shareholder feedback on our\nBoard and its leadership structure. In\naddition, our Governance Committee considers\nfeedback on the Chairman of the Board received\nin connection with the Board evaluation. As a\nresult of this review, our Governance\nCommittee determined that continuing to have\nMr. Solomon serve as both Chairman and\nCEO\u0097working together with a strong independent\nLead Director\u0097is the most effective leadership\nstructure for our Board and our firm at this\ntime. Ultimately, we believe that our current\nleadership structure, together with strong\ngovernance practices, creates a productive\nrelationship between our Board and management,\nincluding strong independent oversight that\nbenefits our shareholders. We will continue to\nconduct Board leadership assessments annually.\nIf at any time our Governance Committee\ndetermines it would be appropriate to appoint\nan independent Chairman, it will not hesitate\nto do so.\n                               \n  BENEFITS OF A COMBINED ROLE  \n                               \n                                              \n       A combined Chairman-CEO structure      \n       provides our firm with a senior        \n       leader who serves                      \n       as a primary liaison between our       \n  \u220e    Board and management, and as a         \n       primary public face of our firm.

The Committee carries out this\nfunction through an ongoing, year-round\nprocess, which includes the Committee\u0092s annual\nevaluation of our Board and individual\ndirector evaluations. Each director and\ndirector candidate is evaluated by our\nGovernance Committee based on his or her\nindividual merits, taking into account our\nfirm\u0092s needs and the composition of our Board.\nTo assist in this evaluation, the Committee\nutilizes as a discussion tool a matrix of\ncertain skills and experiences that would be\nbeneficial to have represented on our Board\nand on our Committees at any particular point\nin time. For example, the Committee is focused\non what skills are beneficial for service in\nkey Board positions, such as Lead Director and\nCommittee Chairs, and conducts a succession\nplanning process for those positions. Our\nGovernance Committee welcomes candidates\nrecommended by shareholders and will consider\nthese candidates in the same manner as other\ncandidates.

Upon joining\nour Board, new directors are provided with a\ncomprehensive orientation about our firm,\nincluding our business, strategy and\ngovernance. For example, new directors\n(including Ms. Uhl and Ms. Harris during 2021)\ntypically meet with senior leaders covering\neach of our revenue-producing divisions and\nregions, as well as with senior leaders from\nkey control, finance and operating functions.\nNew directors also participate in orientation\nsessions covering the responsibilities and key\nareas of focus of each of the Board\u0092s\nCommittees.

We believe this\nbalanced approach, which is consistent with\nindustry practice, is appropriate for our\nfirm, and that a more formulaic compensation\nprogram would not be in the long-term best\ninterests of our firm, our shareholders and\nother stakeholders.\n                                              \n       Avoids Unintended Consequences and     \n       Mitigates Compensation-Related Risk.   \n       Our business is dynamic and requires   \n       us to respond rapidly to changes in    \n       our operating environment. As such,    \n  \u220e    our annual compensation program is     \n       designed to encourage appropriate      \n       prudence by our senior leaders, on     \n       behalf of our shareholders and our     \n       clients, regardless of prevailing      \n       market conditions.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       We utilize a Performance Assessment    \n       Framework to provide greater           \n       definition to, and transparency        \n       regarding, the pre-established         \n       financial and non-financial factors    \n       considered by the Compensation         \n       Committee to assess the firm\u0092s          \n  \u00bb    performance in connection with         \n       compensation decisions                 \n       for our NEOs and other senior          \n       leaders. However, a strictly           \n       formulaic compensation program would   \n       not permit adjustments based on less   \n       quantifiable factors, such as          \n       unexpected external events or          \n       individual performance.                \n                                              \n                                              \n       As an example, during Spring 2020,     \n       the Board was able to utilize its      \n       judgment without being constrained by  \n  \u00bb    a formulaic plan                       \n       to hold 2020 compensation for our CEO  \n       flat year-over-year, despite the       \n       firm\u0092s strong performance and before    \n       applying the 1MDB-related reduction.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Performance-Based Pay Provides         \n       Alignment.

To this                    \n       end, we engage extensively with our    \n       stakeholders each year and the         \n       feedback received continues to inform  \n  \u220e    our Board and Compensation Committee   \n       actions. For example, in 2021 we       \n       (including, in certain cases, our      \n       Lead Director and/or our Compensation  \n       Committee Chair) met with              \n       shareholders representing more than    \n       35% of Common Stock outstanding to     \n       discuss compensation-related matters   \n       and other areas of focus.              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Board Responsiveness.

without   \n       ascribing specific weight to any       \n       single factor or metric, as we         \n       continue to believe that a formulaic   \n       compensation program would not be in

 for 2021, the Committee received       \n       absolute and relative financial        \n       metrics and took                       \n  \u220e    into account the records set across a  \n       variety of firmwide and divisional     \n       metrics as well as the context of the  \n       broader operating environment,         \n       including the sustainability of        \n       certain

2021 results were       \n       achieved, including how the firm       \n       continued to invest in                 \n       its future, and how each NEO and each  \n  \u220e    division contributed to the various    \n       client, risk management, and people    \n       scorecard-related strategies and       \n       goals set forth in the Framework,      \n       including as

our        \n       Executive Leadership Team, drove       \n       execution of our strategic plan        \n       throughout 2021 and                    \n       made continued, strong progress        \n       towards our January 2020 Investor Day  \n       goals and strategic objectives,        \n  \u220e    including through the announced        \n       acquisitions of NNIP and GreenSky.     \n       Pursuant to the Performance            \n       Assessment Framework, the Committee    \n       considered                             \n       progress towards achieving our         \n       strategic goals in 2021 by reviewing   \n       a dashboard of progress across         \n       various KPIs.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       These actions are expected to set the  \n       firm on a path to more durable         \n       revenues over time, drive continued    \n  \u00bb    financial

In addition,\nour NEOs, non-employeedirectors and all other\nemployees are prohibited from hedging or\npledging their equity-based awards. Our\nemployees, other than our executive officers,\nmay hedge only shares of our Common Stock that\nthey can otherwise sell.

Qualified\nRetirement Benefits During 2021, each NEO\n(other than Mr. Berlinski) participated in The\nGoldman Sachs 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan), which\nis our U.S. broad-based tax-\nqualifiedretirement plan. In 2021, these\nindividuals were eligible to make pre-\ntaxand/or \u0093Roth\u0094 after-taxcontributions to our\n401(k) Plan and receive a dollar-for-\ndollarmatching contribution from us on the\namount they contributed, up to a maximum of\n$11,600. For 2021, these individuals each\nreceived a matching contribution of $11,600.\nMr. Berlinski has not participated in the U.K.\ndefined contribution arrangement, known as\nLifeSight (the U.K. Defined Contribution\nArrangement) since July 2019, when he\nrelocated on assignment to the U.S. The firm\nprovides overseas employees who can no longer\nparticipate in the U.K. Defined Contribution\nArrangement with an annual payment in lieu of\nhis or her participation. The amount of this\npayment for 2021 for Mr. Berlinski was\n$17,004, which is approximately equal to the\nfirm\u0092s annual cost in respect of participation\nin the U.K. Defined Contribution Arrangement.\nPerquisites and Other Benefits Our NEOs\nreceived in 2021 certain benefits that are\nconsidered \u0093perquisites\u0094 for purposes of the\nSEC rules regarding compensation disclosure.\nWhile our Compensation Committee was provided\nwith the estimated value of these items, it\ndetermined, as in prior years, not to give\nthese amounts significant consideration in\ndetermining our NEOs\u0092 2021 variable\ncompensation.\n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2022          |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    55  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u0097COMPENSATION DISCUSSION\nAND ANALYSIS GS GIVES During 2021, we made\navailable to each of our Executive Leadership\nTeam a car and driver and, in some cases,\nother services for security and/or business\npurposes. We also offered our NEOs benefits\nand tax counseling services, generally\nprovided or arranged by our subsidiary, The\nAyco Company, L.P. (Ayco), to assist them with\ntax and regulatory compliance and to provide\nthem with more time to focus on the needs of\nour business. Our NEOs participate in our\nexecutive medical and dental program and\nreceive executive life insurance while they\nremain PMDs. Our NEOs also receive long-term\ndisability insurance coverage. Our NEOs (and\ntheir covered dependents) are also eligible\nfor a retiree healthcare program and receive\ncertain other perquisites, some of which have\nno incremental cost to us. At our request, Mr.\nBerlinski relocated from London to our New\nYork office in August 2019, and during 2021,\nconsistent with our standard Global Mobility\nServices program, Mr. Berlinski received\ninternational assignment benefits and tax\nequalization and protection payments in\nconnection with that arrangement. See \u0093All\nOther Compensation\u0094 and footnote (e) in \u0097\nExecutive Compensation\u00972021 Summary\nCompensation Table. Section 162(m) Section\n162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the\ntax deductibility of executive compensation\npaid to each of our \u0093covered employees\u0094 to $1\nmillion. In setting 2021 executive\ncompensation, our Compensation Committee\nconsidered the factors identified in more\ndetail in \u0097 How Our Compensation Committee\nMakes Its Decisionsand did not take this limit\non deductibility into account.\n         \n  GS     \n  GIVES  \n         \nAs a key element of the firm\u0092s overall impact\ninvesting platform, we established our GS\nGivesprogram to coordinate, facilitate and\nencourage global philanthropy by our PMDs.\nDuring 2020, the firm made contributions that\nsupported an approximately $180 million 2021\nGS Givesprogram. GS Givesunderscores our\ncommitment to philanthropy through diversified\nand impactful giving, harnessing the\ncollaborative spirit of the firm\u0092s partnership\nwhile also inspiring our firm\u0092s next\ngeneration of philanthropists. We ask our PMDs\nto make recommendations of not-for-\nprofitorganizations to receive grants from the\nfirm\u0092s contributions to GS Gives. GS Giveshas\nmade approximately $2 billion in grants and\npartnered with over 8,500 not-for-\nprofitorganizations in 100+ countries around\nthe world since its inception. Grant\nrecommendations from our PMDs help to ensure\nthat GS Givesinvests in a diverse group of\ncharities that improves the lives of people in\ncommunities around the world. We encourage our\nPMDs to make recommendations of grants to\norganizations consistent with GS Gives\u0092mission\nof fostering innovative ideas, solving\neconomic and social issues, and enabling\nprogress in underserved communities globally.\nGS Givesundertakes diligence procedures for\ndonations and has no obligation to follow\nrecommendations made to us by our PMDs. In\n2021, GS Givesaccepted the recommendations of\nover 570 current and retired PMDs and granted\nover $230 million to over 2,500 not-for-\nprofitorganizations around the world. GS\nGivesmade grants in support of a broad range\nof large-scale initiatives, including the\nAnalyst Impact Fund, ongoing COVID-19relief\nefforts, and advancing racial equity.

For a discussion\nof 2021 annual NEO compensation, please read \u0097\nCompensation Discussion and Analysisabove.\nPursuant to SEC rules, the 2021 Summary\nCompensation Table is required to include for\na particular year only those equity-based\nawards granted duringthat year, rather than\nawards granted after year-end,even if awarded\nfor services in that year. SEC rules require\ndisclosure of cash compensation to be included\nin the year earned, even if payment is made\nafter year-end.

Mr. Berlinski has   \n  two records in the plan, the normal         \n  retirement age for the first period of      \n  service is age 50, and the normal           \n  retirement age for the second period of     \n  service is age 65.

For        \n       2019 Year-End RSUs, the NEO generally  \n       would have forfeited all of these      \n       awards if the association occurred in  \n       2020; would have forfeited two-thirds  \n       of these awards if                     \n       the association occurred in 2021; and  \n       will forfeit one-third of these        \n       awards if the association occurs in    \n       2022. For 2020, 2019 and 2018          \n       Year-End PSUs and the SVC Awards,      \n       the NEO generally would forfeit all    \n       of these awards if the association     \n       occurred or occurs in the applicable   \n       performance period (which is 2021      \n       through 2023, 2020 through 2022 and    \n       2019 through 2021, for Year-End        \n       PSUs respectively, and 2021 through    \n       2026 for SVC Awards).

The\nfirm amended the retiree healthcare program\neffective January 1, 2022 to provide a subsidy\nequal to 100% of the individual premium for\ncurrent retirees with eight years of PMD\nservice and active PMDs who retire with eight\nyears of PMD service. Any elected coverage for\nspouses/partners or dependents will no longer\nbe subsidized by the firm. In addition, any\nnew PMDs promoted or hired on or after January\n1, 2021, will no longer receive a firm subsidy\ntoward retiree healthcare and will be required\nto pay 100% of the retiree medical premium.\nEach of our NEOs (other than Ms. Ruemmler) is\neligible for this revised subsidy; Ms.\nRuemmler is eligible to receive access to the\nretiree healthcare program at full cost with\nno firm subsidy. The values provided above\nreflect the present value of the cost to us of\nthe 100% individual subsidy starting in 2022\n(current plan still in effect for 2021) and\nwere determined using a December 31, 2021\nretirement date and the following assumptions:\na 3.12% discount rate; mortality estimates\nbased on the PRI-2012white collar fully\ngenerational mortality table, with adjustments\nto reflect continued improvements in mortality\nbased on Scale MP-2021;estimates of future\nincreases in healthcare subsidy costs of 5.75%\npre-65,6.25% post-65,increasing 0.25% in 2023\nand then grading down 0.25% per year until\nultimate rate of 4.50% for medical and\npharmacy and 5.25% for dental; and assumptions\nfor subsequent eligibility for alternative\ncoverage, which would eliminate subsidies\nunder our program (60% firm subsidized and 40%\nnot firm subsidized). If an NEO becomes\nassociated with certain entities, including\ncertain Covered Enterprises, the NEO may\nforfeit some or all of his or her benefits\nand/or coverage under our retiree healthcare\nprogram. Other Terms As PMDs, during 2021, our\nNEOs were generally subject to a policy of 90\ndays\u0092 notice of termination of employment. We\nmay require that an NEO be inactive (i.e., on\n\u0093garden leave\u0094) during the notice period (or\nwe may waive the requirement). For purposes of\ndescribing our PSUs, RSUs and the SVC Awards,\nthe above-referenced terms generally have the\nfollowing meanings: \u0093 Cause\u0094 means the NEO (a)\nis convicted in a criminal proceeding on\ncertain misdemeanor charges, on a felony\ncharge or an equivalent charge;

compensation consultant, to conduct\nan independent review of our non-\nemployeeDirector Compensation Program. FW Cook\nassessed the structure of our Director\nCompensation Program and its value compared to\ncompetitive market practices, taking into\naccount the emphasis on equity compensation,\nthe hold-through retirement requirement and\nother restrictions on the RSUs as well as the\nAugust 2020 resolution of the director\ncompensation litigation and the fixed amount\nof annual director compensation specified in\nthe SIP, which was approved by our\nshareholders at the 2021 Annual Meeting. FW\nCook determined that the Director Compensation\nProgram remained competitive with the market\nand continued to align the interests of our\nnon-employeedirectors with the long-term\ninterests of our shareholders. Our Governance\nCommittee determined that FW Cook is\nindependent and does not have conflicts of\ninterest in providing services to our\nGovernance Committee.\n                         \n  2021 DIRECTOR SUMMARY  \n  COMPENSATION TABLE     \n                         \nThe following table sets forth the\ncompensation for our non-employeedirectors as\ndetermined by SEC rules, which require us to\ninclude equity awards granted during2021 and\ncash compensation earned for2021.\nHistorically, we have granted equity-based\nawards to our non-employeedirectors for a\nparticular year shortly after that year\u0092s end.\nWhile we continue this practice for the Annual\nGrant RSUs, this year we started granting RSUs\nin respect of the 2021 Annual Retainer and/or\nCommittee Chair Fee, quarterly in arrears (to\nprovide for periodic grants and payments over\nthe course of the year and in alignment with\nmarket practice).

Shareholder Proposal Regarding\nCharitable Giving Reporting The National\nCenter for Public Policy Research, 20 F\nStreet, NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC 20001,\nbeneficial owner of at least $2,000 in market\nvalue of the company\u0092s Common Stock for at\nleast three years, is the proponent of the\nfollowing shareholder proposal. The proponent\nhas advised us that a representative will\npresent the proposal and related supporting\nstatement at our Annual Meeting.\n              \n  PROPONENT\u0092S  \n  STATEMENT   \n              \nCharitable Giving Reporting Whereas:Charitable\ncontributions should enhance the image of our\ncompany in the eyes of the public. Increased\ndisclosure of these contributions would serve\nto create greater goodwill for our Company. It\nwould also allow the public to better voice\nits opinions on our corporate giving strategy.\nInevitably, some organizations might be viewed\nmore favorably than others. This could be\nuseful in guiding our Company\u0092s philanthropic\ndecision making in the future. Corporate\ngiving should ultimately enhance shareholder\nvalue. Resolved:That the shareholders request\nthe Company to list the recipients of\ncorporate charitable contributions of $5,000\nor more on the company website, along with the\nmaterial limitations, if any, placed on the\nrestrictions, and/or the monitoring of the\ncontributions and its uses, if any, that the\nCompany undertakes. Supporting\nStatement:Current disclosure is insufficient\nto allow the Company\u0092s Board and shareholders\nto evaluate the proper use of corporate assets\nby outside organizations and how those assets\nshould be used, especially for controversial\ncauses.\n                  \n  DIRECTORS\u0092       \n  RECOMMENDATION  \n                  \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE\nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS We already\nprovide significant public information on our\ncore community engagement and philanthropic\nand educational initiatives on our website (\nwww.gs.com , \u0093Our Commitments\u0094), a summary of\nwhich is set forth below, as well as through\nour annual Sustainability Report. These\ninitiatives, together with our employee\nmatching gift program, represent the vast\nmajority of our charitable giving. We also\nmake public filings with the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) for GS Givesand the Goldman\nSachs Foundation, which entities fund the\nsignificant majority of our philanthropic\nactivities; these filings are publicly\navailable on the IRS website (\nwww.irs.gov/charities-and-nonprofits ). To\nthis end, additional reporting, particularly\nat such a low threshold as requested by the\nproposal, would neither provide material\ninformation to our shareholders, nor a clear\npicture of our broader initiatives and the\nstrategic direction of our giving plans. As\nsuch, we believe that adoption of this\nproposal is unnecessary and not in the best\ninterests of our firm or our shareholders.\n                                              \n       In conducting our community            \n       engagement and carrying out our        \n       philanthropic and educational          \n       initiatives, we are guided by          \n       five key principles.

Shareholder\nProposal Regarding a Policy to Ensure Lending\nand Underwriting do not Contribute to New\nFossil Fuel Development The Sierra Club\nFoundation, 2101 Webster Street, Suite 2150,\nOakland, California 94612, beneficial owner of\nat least $2,000 in market value of the\ncompany\u0092s Common Stock since January 2020, is\nthe proponent of the following shareholder\nproposal. The proponent has advised us that a\nrepresentative will present the proposal and\nrelated supporting statement at our Annual\nMeeting.\n              \n  PROPONENT\u0092S  \n  STATEMENT   \n              \nResolved: Shareholders request that the Board\nof Directors adopt a policy by the end of 2022\ncommitting to proactive measures to ensure\nthat the company\u0092s lending and underwriting do\nnot contribute to new fossil fuel development,\nconsistent with fulfilling the United Nations\nEnvironmental Program Finance Initiative\nrecommendations to the G20 Sustainable Finance\nWorking Group, and the International Energy\nAgency\u0092s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario,\nfor credible net zero commitments. Supporting\nStatement Goldman Sachs recognizes that\nclimate change poses a material risk to its\nbusiness. As the 2020 10-Kstates: \u0093Climate\nchange concerns could disrupt our businesses,\nadversely affect client activity levels,\nadversely affect the creditworthiness of our\ncounterparties and damage our reputation.\u0094 1\nGoldman is a member of the Net Zero Banking\nAlliance (NZBA), for which our CEO committed\nto align with pathways consistent with a\nmaximum temperature rise of 1.5 degrees\nCelsius above pre-industriallevels, utilizing\ndecarbonization scenarios from \u0093credible and\nwell-recognized sources.\u0094 2 However,\nmembership in the Alliance does not\nnecessarily equate with alignment with global\nclimate goals. The United Nations\nEnvironmental Program Finance Initiative (UNEP\nFI), which convenes the NZBA, published an\nInput Paper to the G20 Sustainable Finance\nWorking Group which defines credible net zero\ncommitments of financial institutions,\nincluding: \u0093A financial institution\nestablishing a net-zerocommitment should begin\naligning with the required assumptions and\nimplications of IPCC 1.5\u00b0C no/low overshoot\npathways as soon as possible .All no/low\novershoot scenarios indicate an immediate\nreduction in fossil fuels, signaling that\ninvestment in new fossil fuel development is\nnot aligned with 1.5\u00b0C.\u0094 3Another of the\nworld\u0092s most credible sources, the\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA), in its Net\nZero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), states\nthat \u0093no fossil fuel exploration is required\nand no new oil and natural gas fields are\nrequired beyond those that have already been\napproved for development.\u0094 4Goldman has\nrestricted financing for new coal operations\nand Arctic drilling, but has no policy to halt\nfinancing any new oil and gas exploration and\ndevelopment. Goldman is the six-highestU.S.\nfinancier or facilitator of companies\nexpanding fossil fuels, according to the\nBanking on Climate Chaos report. 5 Goldman\nfaces two associated problems: first, its\nprominence in asserting climate leadership\nflies in the face of its actions, creating\nreputational risk from accusations of\ngreenwashing; second, in underwriting projects\nwhich are unneeded under the UNEP FI\nrecommendations or IEA NZE scenario, it is\nknowingly loading potentially stranded assets\nonto its clients\u0092 balance sheets, creating\nlitigation risk. 6In this regard, investors\nneed to know that Goldman\u0092s lending and\nunderwriting policies are consistent with its\nown net zero commitment.\n                                           \n  1  Goldman\u00a0Sachs 2020 Form 10-K, at 43.  \n                                           \n                                              \n  2  https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-co\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  https://g20sfwg.org/wp-content/uploads\u2026  \n     , at 15.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/asse\u2026  \n     , at 100.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  5  https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads\u2026  \n     , at 38.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  6  https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/goldman\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2022          |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    79  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nITEMS 4-7.

Goldman\nSachs has long been committed to driving\ninnovative, commercial solutions to mitigate\nclimate riskand accelerate the climate\ntransition. Our approach to addressing climate\nchange is grounded in our commitment to drive\ndecarbonization in the real economy in\npartnership with our clients. We have embraced\nclimate transition as a key driver of both\nrisk and opportunity, and we have been\ninnovating and expanding our commercial\ncapabilities to help our clients accelerate\ntheir transition. We strongly share the\nproponent\u0092s belief in the criticality of\nclimate transition and achieving the ambitious\ngoals of the Paris Agreement. However, we do\nnot believe that adopting policies that limit\nour ability to provide financing to hard-to-\nabatesectors, which critically need both our\nengagement and our capital, is in the best\ninterests of our shareholders, clients or\ncommunities. We do not believe that placing\nlimits on financing to producers will result\nin either reduction in emissions or demand for\nfossil fuels. Based on a Global Financial\nMarkets Association report, it is estimated\nthat $100 to $150 trillion in investment is\nneeded globally in the highest emitting\nsectors over the next three decades to\ntransition to a low-carboneconomy,\ndemonstrating the critical role that capital\nmarkets can play to support and accelerate\ntransition in the years ahead. Further,\nclimate transition will require thoughtful\npublic policy that strikes a balance between\ncurrent energy capabilities and support for\nnew technology, as well as concrete measures,\nlike a price on carbon, that will accelerate a\njust and orderly transition. Given our\nsignificant investment in decarbonization and\ntransition finance capabilities, we believe\nour shareholders, clients and communities are\nbetter served by our engagement, not our\ndivestment.

We believe\nthat the adoption of this proposal is\nunnecessary and not in the best interests of\nour firm or our shareholders, and it would\nundermine our role in the low carbon\ntransition.\n                                              \n       Goldman\u00a0Sachs has a long-standing      \n       commitment to address the impacts of   \n       climate change and accelerate the      \n       transition to                          \n       a low-carbon economy\u0097we were one of     \n       the first major banks to acknowledge   \n       the scale and urgency of climate       \n       change in 2005 through our             \n       Environmental Policy Framework.

Item\n7. Shareholder Proposal Regarding Special\nShareholder Meeting Thresholds John Chevedden,\n2215 Nelson Avenue, Redondo Beach, California\n90278, beneficial owner of at least $2,000 in\nmarket value of the company\u0092s Common Stock for\nat least three years, is the proponent of the\nfollowing shareholder proposal. The proponent\nhas advised us that a representative will\npresent the proposal and related supporting\nstatement at our Annual Meeting.\n              \n  PROPONENT\u0092S  \n  STATEMENT   \n              \nProposal 7\u0097Special Shareholder Meeting\nImprovement For shareholder Rights\nShareholders ask our board to take the steps\nnecessary to amend the appropriate company\ngoverning documents to give the-ownersof a\ncombined 10% of our outstanding common stock\nthe power to call a special shareholder\nmeeting. Although it now takes a theoretical\n25% of all shares to call for a special\nshareholder meeting, this translates into 33%\nof the Goldman Sachs shares that typically\nvote at the annual meeting. It would be\nhopeless to think that the shares that do not\nhave time to vote at the annual meeting would\nhave the time to take the special procedural\nsteps to call for a special shareholder\nmeeting. Plus the 33% of shares that vote at\nthe annual meeting could translate into\nupwards of 40% support from the shares that\nvote when the shares are included that are in\nsupport of calling an annual meeting but made\na paperwork error which is easy to do. The\nlikelihood of the need to obtain upwards of\n40% shareholder support just to call a special\nmeeting is nothing for management to brag\nabout especially when Goldman Sachs\nshareholders have absolutely no right to act\nby written consent. Plus GS shareholders gave\n42% support to the 2021 shareholder proposal\ncalling for a shareholder right to act by\nwritten consent. This 42% support may have\nrepresented over 51% support from the shares\nthat have access to independent proxy voting\nadvice and are not forced to rely too much on\nthe biased management voting recommendations.\n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2022          |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    81  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nITEMS 4-7. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS Many\ncompanies provide for both a shareholder right\nto call a special shareholder meeting and a\nshareholder right to act by written consent.\nSouthwest Airlines and Target are companies\nthat do not provide for shareholder written\nconsent and yet provide for 10% of shares to\ncall for a special shareholder meeting.\nShareholders also need a more reasonable stock\nownership to call a special shareholder\nmeeting to help make up for the use of online\nshareholder meetings that give management more\ncontrol. At an online meeting management can\ndictate that only one shareholder can speak.\nAnd the vast majority of 2021 online\nshareholder meetings dictated that absolutely\nno shareholders could speak. A reasonable\nshareholder right to call for a special\nshareholder meeting in our bylaws will help\nensure that management engages with\nshareholders in good faith because\nshareholders will have a viable Plan B by\ncalling for a special shareholder meeting. Our\nbylaws give no assurance that shareholder\nengagement will continue. A special\nshareholder meeting can be called to elect a\nnew director. A reasonable right for\nshareholders to call for a special meeting\ncould inspire better performance by existing\ndirectors. For instance, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal\nreceived by far the most negative votes of any\nGS director at the 2021 GS annual meeting.\nPlease vote yes: Special Shareholder Meeting\nImprovement\u0097Proposal 7\n                  \n  DIRECTORS\u0092       \n  RECOMMENDATION  \n                  \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE\nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. Our Board\nregularly seeks input from shareholders to\nhelp ensure our policies reflect best\npractices and are appropriately aligned with\nshareholder interests. Our Board recognizes\nthat many shareholders view the ability to\ncall special meetings as a good corporate\ngovernance practice that enhances shareholder\nrights. We agree, and our Restated Certificate\nof Incorporation and our Amended and Restated\nBy-Lawspermit holders of 25% of our\noutstanding shares of Common Stock the right\nto call a special meeting. Despite assertions\nraised in the proposal, special meetings may\nbe called at the 25% ownership threshold;\nhigher ownership thresholds are not required.\nImportantly, our shareholders\u0092 right to call a\nspecial meeting is only one of many strong\ncorporate governance practices to which we are\ncommitted, including an active, year-round\nshareholder and stakeholder engagement program\nthat includes Board-level engagement. In\naddition, feedback on our special meeting\nthreshold has generally only been raised by\nour shareholders in the context of relevant\nshareholder proposals. For the reasons set\nforth herein, we believe that the adoption of\nthis proposal is unnecessary and not in the\nbest interests of our firm or our\nshareholders.\n                                              \n       We are committed to active engagement  \n       with our shareholders and other        \n  \u220e    stakeholders and we provide a number   \n       of avenues                             \n       for such engagement.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Active, year-round engagement. Our firm  \n     and our Board maintain open lines of     \n     communication with our shareholders      \n     (see Stakeholder Engagement). For        \n     example, during 2021, we engaged with    \n  \u00bb  shareholders representing more than 35%  \n     of our Common Stock outstanding.         \n     Further, our Lead Director and/or the    \n     Chair of our Compensation Committee met  \n     with shareholders                        \n     representing more than 25% of our        \n     Common Stock outstanding in 2021.        \n                                              \n                                              \n     Annual Meetings. Annual shareholder      \n     meetings provide an appropriate          \n     mechanism for all shareholders,          \n     including                                \n     small holders, such as the proponent,    \n     to raise matters for shareholder         \n     deliberation in an organized,            \n     predictable, efficient and informed      \n  \u00bb  manner. We are committed to annual       \n     meeting best practices. Contrary to      \n     assertions raised in the proposal, and   \n     taking into account feedback from our    \n     extensive shareholder engagement         \n     program, we are not aware of any         \n     shareholder\u0097including the proponent\u0097who    \n     had concerns or complaints regarding     \n     the way in which we conducted our 2021   \n     Annual Meeting.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Special Meetings. We provide             \n     shareholders with a meaningful right to  \n     call a special meeting that takes into   \n     account the composition of our           \n     shareholder base.

Related Person\nTransactions Policy Our Board has a written\nRelated Person Transactions Policy regarding\nthe review and approval of transactions\nbetween us and \u0093related persons\u0094 (directors,\nexecutive officers, immediate family members\nof a director or executive officer, or known\n5% shareholders). Under this policy,\ntransactions that exceed $120,000 in which a\nrelated person has, may have or may be deemed\nto have a direct or indirect material interest\nare submitted to the Designated Reviewers (the\nChairs of the Governance, Audit and Risk\nCommittees) or our full Governance Committee\nfor review and approval, as applicable.\nCertain transactions, including employment\nrelationships, ordinary course banking,\nbrokerage, investment, lending and other\nservices, payment of certain regulatory filing\nfees and certain other ordinary course non-\npreferentialtransactions, have been determined\nby the Governance Committee to be preapproved\ntransactions, and thus do not require specific\nreview and approval under the policy (although\nthese transactions must be reported to our\nGovernance Committee and may still be\nsubmitted for review and approval if deemed\nappropriate). In reviewing and determining\nwhether to approve a related person\ntransaction, the following factors, among\nothers, are considered:\n                                              \n  \u220e    Whether the transaction is in the      \n       interests of us and our shareholders;  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction would impair   \n  \u220e    the independence of an independent     \n       director;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction presents a     \n       conflict of interest, taking into      \n       account the size of the transaction,   \n       the financial                          \n  \u220e    position of the director or executive  \n       officer, the nature of the director\u0092s   \n       or executive officer\u0092s interest in the  \n       transaction, the ongoing nature of     \n       the transaction and any other          \n       relevant factors;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction is fair and    \n       reasonable to us and on substantially  \n  \u220e    the same terms as would apply to       \n       comparable                             \n       third\u00a0parties;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    The business reasons for the           \n       transaction;                           \n                                              \n                                     \n  \u220e    Any reputational issues; and  \n                                     \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction is material,   \n  \u220e    taking into account the significance   \n       of the transaction to our investors.   \n                                              \nAll of the transactions and relationships\nreported under \u0097 Certain Relationships and\nTransactionswere determined, under the\nmechanisms of the Related Person Transactions\nPolicy, to be in the best interests of the\nfirm and its shareholders. In addition to our\npolicies on director independence and related\nperson transactions, we also maintain a policy\nwith respect to outside director involvement\nwith financial firms, such as private equity\nfirms or hedge funds. Under this policy, in\ndetermining whether to approve any current or\nproposed affiliation of a non-employeedirector\nwith a financial firm, our Board will\nconsider, among other things, the legal,\nreputational, operational and business issues\npresented, and the nature, feasibility and\nscope of any restrictions, procedures or other\nsteps that would be necessary or appropriate\nto ameliorate any perceived or potential\nfuture conflicts or other issues.\n                                              \n                              PROXY\u00a0          \n                              STATEMENT\u00a0FOR\u00a0  \n  84    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    |    THE\u00a02022\u00a0       \n                              ANNUAL\u00a0MEETING  \n                              OF\u00a0             \n                              SHAREHOLDERS    \n                                              \nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED\nTRANSACTIONS\u0097CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND\nTRANSACTIONS Certain Relationships and\nTransactions\n                                  \n  BROKERAGE AND BANKING SERVICES  \n                                  \nSome of our directors and executive officers\n(and persons or entities affiliated with them)\nhave brokerage and/ or discretionary accounts\nat our broker-dealer affiliates and may\nutilize other ordinary course banking or\nlending products (such as credit cards)\noffered by Goldman Sachs Bank USA.

We believe the\nopportunity to make such investments helps to\npromote teamwork and collaboration across the\nfirm and provides alignment with the firm\u0092s\nstrategy to grow the alternatives business.\nInvestment decisions for the Employee Funds\nare made by the investment teams or committees\nthat are fiduciaries for such funds, and no\nexecutive officers are members of such\ninvestment teams or committees. The Employee\nFunds generally maintain diversified\ninvestment portfolios, and these investment\nopportunities do not affect the incentives of\nour executive officers under our compensation\nprogram. Many of our employees, their spouses,\nrelated charitable foundations or entities\nthey own or control have invested in these\nEmployee Funds. In some cases, we have limited\nparticipation to our PMDs, including our\nexecutive officers, or limited the amount of\nparticipation, and in some cases participation\nmay be limited to individuals eligible to\ninvest pursuant to applicable law. Certain of\nthe Employee Funds provide applicable\ninvestors with an interest in the overrides we\nreceive for managing the funds for independent\ninvestors (Overrides); the level of Override\nfor which applicable investors may be eligible\nmay vary based on certain criteria. Employee\nFunds generally do not require our current or\nretired PMDs and other current or retired\nemployees to pay management fees and do not\ndeduct Overrides from fund distributions.\nSimilarly, certain other investments may be\nmade available to our PMDs, retired PMDs and\nother current employees on a fee-freeor\nreduced fee basis. Distributions and\nredemptions exceeding $120,000 from Employee\nFunds made to our 2021 executive officers (or\npersons or certain entities affiliated with\nthem) during 2021, consisting of profits and\nother income and return of amounts initially\ninvested (excluding Overrides generally\navailable only to PMDs, which are discussed\nbelow) (Distributions), were approximately, in\nthe aggregate, as follows: Mr. Solomon \u0096 $20.9\nmillion; Mr. Waldron \u0096 $6.6 million; Mr.\nScherr \u0096 $7.3 million; Mr. Berlinski \u0096 $2.4\nmillion; John F.W.

During\n2021, Mr. Viniar received approximately $4.8\nmillion in Distributions and $986,000 in\nOverrides in connection with certain legacy\ninvestments in Employee Funds he made prior to\nthe end of his employment in January 2013. Mr.\nViniar has agreed to forfeit any remaining\ninterest in Overrides in connection with these\nlegacy investments in exchange for the fair\nmarket value of these interests. In addition,\nthe firm will repurchase certain of Mr.\nViniar\u0092s legacy investments in Employee Funds\nat a price based on the net asset value of\nthese investments as of December 31, 2021, in\naccordance with firm policy. Based on the most\nrecent available data, the value of these\ninterests to be repurchased, and the value of\nthe Overrides to be forfeited, is estimated to\nbe approximately $2.3 million in the\naggregate. Mr. Viniar will receive payment for\nthese interests after the December 31, 2021\nvaluation is finalized in the ordinary course\nof business, at which time all of Mr. Viniar\u0092s\ninvestments with the firm will be on\nsubstantially the same terms and conditions as\nother similarly situated investors who are\nneither directors nor employees.\n                                              \n  PROXY                                       \n  STATEMENT FOR                               \n  THE 2022          |    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    85  \n  ANNUAL                                      \n  MEETING OF                                  \n  SHAREHOLDERS                                \n                                              \nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED\nTRANSACTIONS\u0097CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND\nTRANSACTIONS Subject to applicable laws, in\naddition, certain of our directors and\nexecutive officers may from time to time\ninvest their personal funds in other funds or\ninvestments that we have established and that\nwe manage or sponsor.

This facility\nis currently partially drawn, resulting in an\napproximately $36 million loan from Goldman\nSachs outstanding under this facility. Goldman\nSachs also participates in a $212.5 million\ncredit facility for an entity in which\nArcelorMittal is an approximately 25%\nshareholder, which facility was extended in\n2022. Under the facility, Goldman Sachs has\nagreed to lend up to approximately $22.5\nmillion at an interest rate of Libor + 450\nbasis points. Goldman Sachs currently has no\nloan outstanding under this facility. In June\n2021, Goldman Sachs acted as a dealer manager\nin connection with a cash tender offer by\nArcelorMittal to buyback approximately $1.4\nbillion, in the aggregate, of certain of its\nU.S. dollar- and Euro-denominated debt. Each\nof these transactions was conducted on, and\nall of these services were provided on, an\narm\u0092s-lengthbasis. Mr. Ogunlesi is the\nChairman and Managing Partner of Global\nInfrastructure Partners LLC (together with its\naffiliates, GIP). In connection with his role\nat GIP, Mr. Ogunlesi is entitled to less than\n5% of the total profit of the fund that\nparticipated in the following transactions,\nand he also has a direct or indirect interest\nin such fund amounting to less than 0.02% of\nsuch fund. During 2021, Goldman Sachs acted as\nfinancial advisor to a third-party client that\nacquired a GIP fund\u0092s stake in a portfolio\ncompany in an approximately $2.5 billion\ntransaction resulting from a competitive\nbidding process. In August 2021, Goldman Sachs\nacted as an underwriter in an approximately\n$750 million private debt offering for a\ncompany in which a fund managed by GIP is an\ninvestor. Proceeds were primarily used to fund\na repurchase of units in the company owned by\nsuch fund managed by GIP. In October 2021,\nGoldman Sachs also acted as an underwriter in\nan approximately $224 million public common\nstock offering for a company in which a fund\nmanaged by GIP was a selling stockholder. Such\nfund received approximately $109 million of\nthe proceeds of the offering. In each of these\ntransactions, Goldman Sachs\u0092 relationship with\nthis company pre-datesGIP\u0092s investment\ntherein. Each of these transactions was\nconducted on, and all of these services were\nprovided on, an arm\u0092s-lengthbasis. During\n2021, Goldman Sachs continued its consulting\nrelationship with the company for which the\nspouse of Mr. Rogers serves as CEO and\nmanaging partner; the service agreement\nprovides for annual fees of approximately $1\nmillion for the provision of advice and\ninsights in support of the firm\u0092s business\nstrategy in China. This consulting\nrelationship was entered into on an\narm\u0092s-lengthbasis.\n                   \n  5% SHAREHOLDERS  \n                   \nFor information on transactions involving\nGoldman Sachs, on the one hand, and BlackRock,\nInc., State Street Corporation or The Vanguard\nGroup, on the other, see footnotes (a), (b)\nand (c) under Beneficial Ownership\u0097Beneficial\nOwners of More Than Five Percent.\n                                              \n                              PROXY\u00a0          \n                              STATEMENT\u00a0FOR\u00a0  \n  86    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    |    THE\u00a02022\u00a0       \n                              ANNUAL\u00a0MEETING  \n                              OF\u00a0             \n                              SHAREHOLDERS    \n                                              \nBENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP\u0097BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF\nDIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Beneficial\nOwnership Beneficial Ownership of Directors\nand Executive Officers The following table\ncontains certain information, as of February\n28, 2022, regarding beneficial ownership of\nCommon Stock by each director, nominee and\nNEO, as well as by all directors, nominees,\nNEOs and other executive officers as a group\nas of such date.

What is a Broker\nNon-Vote? A \u0093broker\nnon-vote\u0094occurs when\nyour broker submits a\nproxy for the meeting\nwith respect to the\nratification of the\nappointment of our\nindependent registered\npublic accounting firm\nbut does not vote on\nnon-\ndiscretionarymatters\nbecause you did not\nprovide voting\ninstructions on these\nmatters. What is the\nquorum requirement for\nour Annual Meeting? A\nquorum is required to\ntransact business at\nour Annual Meeting. The\nholders of a majority\nof the outstanding\nshares of Common Stock\nas of February 28,\n2022, present in person\nor represented by proxy\nand entitled to vote,\nwill constitute a\nquorum.

If you\nchoose to abstain from\nvoting on the Election\nof Directors, your\nabstention will have no\neffect, as the required\nvote is calculated\nthrough the following\ncalculation: votes FOR\ndivided by the sum of\nvotes FOR plus votes\nAGAINST. If you choose\nto abstain from voting\non any other matter at\nour Annual Meeting,\nyour abstention will be\ncounted as a vote\nAGAINST the proposal,\nas the required vote is\ncalculated through the\nfollowing calculation:\nvotes FOR divided by\nthe sum of votes FOR\nplus votes AGAINST plus\nvotes ABSTAINING.\n                                              \n                              PROXY\u00a0          \n                              STATEMENT\u00a0FOR\u00a0  \n  96    GOLDMAN\u00a0SACHS    |    THE\u00a02022\u00a0       \n                              ANNUAL\u00a0MEETING  \n                              OF\u00a0             \n                              SHAREHOLDERS    \n                                              \nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Who counts the\nvotes cast at our Annual Meeting?\nRepresentatives of Broadridge will tabulate\nthe votes cast at our Annual Meeting, and\nAmerican Election Services, LLC will act as\nthe independent inspector of election. How is\nvoting affected by shareholders who\nparticipate in certain Goldman Sachs Partner\nCompensation plans? Employees of Goldman Sachs\nwho participate in the PCP are \u0093covered\npersons\u0094 under our Shareholders\u0092 Agreement.\nOur Shareholders\u0092 Agreement governs, among\nother things, the voting of shares of Common\nStock owned by each covered person directly or\njointly with a spouse (but excluding shares\nacquired under our 401(k) Plan). Shares of\nCommon Stock subject to our Shareholders\u0092\nAgreement are called \u0093voting shares.\u0094 Our\nShareholders\u0092 Agreement requires that before\nany of our shareholders vote, a separate,\npreliminary vote is held by the persons\ncovered by our Shareholders\u0092 Agreement. In the\nelection of directors, all voting shares will\nbe voted in favor of the election of the\ndirector nominees receiving the highest\nnumbers of votes cast by the covered persons\nin the preliminary vote. For all other\nmatters, all voting shares will be voted in\naccordance with the majority of the votes cast\nby the covered persons in the preliminary\nvote. If you are a party to our Shareholders\u0092\nAgreement, you previously gave an irrevocable\nproxy to our Shareholders\u0092 Committee to vote\nyour voting shares at our Annual Meeting in\naccordance with the preliminary vote, and to\nvote on any other matters that may come before\nour Annual Meeting as the proxy holder sees\nfit in a manner that is not inconsistent with\nthe preliminary vote and that does not\nfrustrate the intent of the preliminary vote.\nAs of February 28, 2022, 9,362,045 shares of\nCommon Stock were beneficially owned by the\nparties to the Shareholders\u0092 Agreement. Each\nperson who is a party to our Shareholders\u0092\nAgreement disclaims beneficial ownership of\nthe shares subject to the agreement that are\nowned by any other party. As of February 28,\n2022, 8,669,230 of the outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock that were held by parties to our\nShareholders\u0092 Agreement were subject to the\nvoting provisions of our Shareholders\u0092\nAgreement (representing approximately 2.57% of\nthe outstanding shares entitled to vote at our\nAnnual Meeting). The preliminary vote with\nrespect to the voting shares will be concluded\non or about April 15, 2022. Other than this\nShareholders\u0092 Agreement (which covers our\nChairman and CEO, who is also a director),\nthere are no voting agreements by or among any\nof our directors. Where can I find the voting\nresults of our Annual Meeting? We expect to\nannounce the preliminary voting results at our\nAnnual Meeting. The final voting results will\nbe reported in a Current Report on Form\n8-Kthat will be posted on our website.

Once you sign up, you will\ncontinue to receive proxy materials\nelectronically until you revoke this\npreference. Who pays the expenses of this\nproxy solicitation? Our proxy materials are\nbeing used by our Board in connection with the\nsolicitation of proxies for our Annual\nMeeting.

Our directors,\nofficers and employees will receive no\nadditional compensation for any such\nsolicitation. We have also hired Morrow Sodali\nLLC, 333 Ludlow Street, 5th Floor, South\nTower, Stamford, Connecticut 06902, to assist\nin the solicitation and distribution of\nproxies, for which they will receive a fee of\n$25,000, as well as reimbursement for certain\nout-of-pocketcosts and expenses. We will\nreimburse brokers, including Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC, and other similar institutions for\ncosts incurred by them in mailing proxy\nmaterials to beneficial owners.

ROTE is calculated by\ndividing net earnings applicable to common\nshareholders by average monthly tangible\ncommon shareholders\u0092 equity (tangible common\nshareholders\u0092 equity is calculated as total\nshareholders\u0092 equity less preferred stock,\ngoodwill and identifiable intangible assets).\nManagement believes that ROTE is meaningful\nbecause it measures the performance of\nbusinesses consistently, whether they were\nacquired or developed internally, and that\ntangible common shareholders\u0092 equity is\nmeaningful because it is a measure that the\nfirm and investors use to assess capital\nadequacy. ROTE and tangible common\nshareholders\u0092 equity are non-GAAPmeasures and\nmay not be comparable to similar non-\nGAAPmeasures used by other companies.
