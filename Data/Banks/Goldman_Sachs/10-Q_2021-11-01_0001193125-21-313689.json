The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a      \nvoting interest entity or a variable interest \nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)   \nthe total equity investment at risk is        \nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity  \nholders have the power to direct the          \nactivities of the entity that most            \nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the    \nentity and the right to receive the residual  \nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting  \ninterest entity is ownership of a majority    \nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest \nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable  \nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that    \nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a \nvoting interest entity. The firm has a        \ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when  \nthe firm has a variable interest or interests \nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct  \nthe activities of the VIE that most           \nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic       \nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb \nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive     \nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially  \nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for    \nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method \nInvestments. When the firm does not have a    \ncontrolling financial interest in an entity   \nbut can exert significant influence over the  \nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair \nvalue by electing the fair value option       \navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant        \ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns \n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstancecommon stock. In certain cases, the  \nfirm applies the equity method of accounting  \nto new investments that are strategic in      \nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s       \nprincipal business activities, when the firm  \nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or   \nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less     \nsignificant. See Note 8 for further           \ninformation about equity-method investments.  \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form        6  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investment Funds. The firm has    \nformed investment funds with third-party      \ninvestors. These funds are typically organized\nas limited partnerships or limited liability  \ncompanies for which the firm acts as general  \npartner or manager. Generally, the firm does  \nnot hold a majority of the economic interests \nin these funds. These funds are usually voting\ninterest entities and generally are not       \nconsolidated because third-party investors    \ntypically have rights to terminate the funds  \nor to remove the firm as general partner or   \nmanager. Investments in these funds are       \ngenerally measured at net asset value (NAV)   \nand are included in investments. See Notes 8, \n18 and 22 for further information about       \ninvestments in funds. Use of Estimates        \nPreparation of these consolidated financial   \nstatements requires management to make certain\nestimates and assumptions, the most important \nof which relate to fair value measurements,   \nthe allowance for credit losses on loans and  \nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,    \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and provisions for losses    \nthat may arise from tax audits. These         \nestimates and assumptions are based on the    \nbest available information but actual results \ncould be materially different. Revenue        \nRecognition Financial Assets and Liabilities  \nat Fair Value. Trading assets and liabilities \nand certain investments are carried at fair   \nvalue either under the fair value option or in\naccordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, \nthe firm has elected to account for certain of\nits loans and other financial assets and      \nliabilities at fair value by electing the fair\nvalue option. The fair value of a financial   \ninstrument is the amount that would be        \nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer \na liability in an orderly transaction between \nmarket participants at the measurement date.  \nFinancial assets are marked to bid prices and \nfinancial liabilities are marked to offer     \nprices. Fair value measurements do not include\ntransaction costs. Fair value gains or losses \nare generally included in market making or    \nother principal transactions. See Note 4 for  \nfurther information about fair value          \nmeasurements. Revenue from Contracts with     \nClients. The firm recognizes revenue earned   \nfrom contracts with clients for services, such\nas investment banking, investment management, \nand execution and clearing (contracts with    \nclients), when the performance obligations    \nrelated to the underlying transaction are     \ncompleted. Revenues from contracts with       \nclients represent approximately 50% of total  \nnon-interestrevenues for the three months     \nended September 2021 and approximately 40% for\nthe nine months ended September 2021 (in each \ncase, reflecting approximately 90% of         \ninvestment banking revenues, approximately 95%\nof investment management revenues and all     \ncommissions and fees), and approximately 45%  \nof total non-interest revenues for both the   \nthree and nine months ended September 2020 (in\neach case, reflecting approximately 90% of    \ninvestment banking revenues, approximately 95%\nof investment management revenues and all     \ncommissions and fees). See Note 25 for        \ninformation about net revenues by business    \nsegment. Investment Banking Advisory. Fees    \nfrom financial advisory assignments are       \nrecognized in revenues when the services      \nrelated to the underlying transaction are     \ncompleted under the terms of the assignment.  \nNon-refundabledeposits and milestone payments \nin connection with financial advisory         \nassignments are recognized in revenues upon   \ncompletion of the underlying transaction or   \nwhen the assignment is otherwise concluded.   \nExpenses associated with financial advisory   \nassignments are recognized when incurred and  \nare included in transaction based expenses.   \nClient reimbursements for such expenses are   \nincluded in investment banking revenues.      \nUnderwriting. Fees from underwriting          \nassignments are recognized in revenues upon   \ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses      \nassociated with underwriting assignments are  \ngenerally deferred until the related revenue  \nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise  \nconcluded. Such expenses are included in      \ntransaction based expenses for completed      \nassignments.                                  \n                                              \n  7    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form      \n       10-Q                                   \n                                              \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.      \nDistribution fees paid by the firm are        \ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net     \nasset value or the committed capital. Such    \nfees are included in transaction based        \nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are  \ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or     \nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other   \nperformance target. Incentive fees are        \ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a   \nfund. Fees that are based on performance over \na twelve-month period are subject to          \nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment \nperformance over the life of the fund, future \ninvestment underperformance may require fees  \npreviously distributed to the firm to be      \nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned   \nfrom a fund or separately managed account are \nrecognized when it is probable that a         \nsignificant reversal of such fees will not    \noccur, which is generally when such fees are  \nno longer subject to fluctuations in the      \nmarket value of investments held by the fund  \nor separately managed account. Therefore,     \nincentive fees recognized during the period   \nmay relate to performance obligations         \nsatisfied in previous periods. Commissions and\nFees The firm earns commissions and fees from \nexecuting and clearing client transactions on \nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter(OTC) transactions.           \nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides \nthird-party research services to clients in   \nconnection with certain soft-dollar           \narrangements. Third-party research costs      \nincurred by the firm in connection with such  \narrangements are presented net within         \ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance   \nObligations Remaining performance obligations \nare services that the firm has committed to   \nperform in the future in connection with its  \ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining  \nperformance obligations are generally related \nto its financial advisory assignments and     \ncertain investment management activities.     \nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory    \nassignments cannot be determined until the    \noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s    \ninvestment management activities, where fees  \nare calculated based on the net asset value of\nthe fund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining       \nperformance obligations cannot be determined  \nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in   \nthe market value of investments held by the   \nfund or separately managed account. The firm  \nis able to determine the future revenues      \nassociated with management fees calculated    \nbased on committed capital. As of September   \n2021, substantially all future net revenues   \nassociated with such remaining performance    \nobligations will be recognized through 2028.  \nAnnual revenues associated with such          \nperformance obligations average less than $   \n250million through 2028. Transfers of         \nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has  \nrelinquished control over the assets          \ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses   \nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or     \nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s        \ncontinuing involvement with transferred       \nfinancial assets are initially recognized at  \nfair value. For transfers of financial assets \nthat are not accounted for as sales, the      \nassets are generally included in trading      \nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a \ncollateralized financing, with the related    \ninterest expense recognized over the life of  \nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further      \ninformation about transfers of financial      \nassets accounted for as collateralized        \nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted \nfor as sales.                                 \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form        8  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Cash and    \ncash equivalents also included interest-      \nbearing deposits with banks of $ 201.60billion\nas of September 2021 and $ 143.89billion as of\nDecember 2020. The firm segregates cash for   \nregulatory and other purposes related to      \nclient activity. Cash and cash equivalents    \nsegregated for regulatory and other purposes  \nwere $ 24.71billion as of September 2021 and $\n24.52billion as of December 2020. In addition,\nthe firm segregates securities for regulatory \nand other purposes related to client activity.\nSee Note 11 for further information about     \nsegregated securities. Customer and Other     \nReceivables Customer and other receivables    \nincluded receivables from customers and       \ncounterparties of $ 109.60billion as of       \nSeptember 2021 and $ 82.39billion as of       \nDecember 2020, and receivables from brokers,  \ndealers and clearing organizations of $       \n62.18billion as of September 2021 and $       \n38.94billion as of December 2020. Such        \nreceivables primarily consist of customer     \nmargin loans, receivables resulting from      \nunsettled transactions and collateral posted  \nin connection with certain derivative         \ntransactions. Substantially all of these      \nreceivables are accounted for at amortized    \ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,  \nwhich generally approximates fair value. As   \nthese receivables are not accounted for at    \nfair value, they are not included in the      \nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through\n10. Had these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of   \nboth September 2021 and December 2020. See    \nNote 10 for further information about customer\nand other receivables accounted for at fair   \nvalue under the fair value option. Interest on\ncustomer and other receivables is recognized  \nover the life of the transaction and included \nin interest income. Customer and other        \nreceivables includes receivables from         \ncontracts with clients and contract assets.   \nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to \nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s    \nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n3.23billion as of September 2021 and $        \n2.60billion as of December 2020. As of both   \nSeptember 2021 and December 2020 contract     \nassets were not material. Customer and Other  \nPayables Customer and other payables included \npayables to customers and counterparties of $ \n230.71billion as of September 2021 and $      \n183.57billion as of December 2020, and        \npayables to brokers, dealers and clearing     \norganizations of $ 21.41billion as of         \nSeptember 2021 and $ 7.09billion as of        \nDecember 2020. Such payables primarily consist\nof customer credit balances related to the    \nfirm\u2019s prime brokerage activities. Customer   \nand other payables are accounted for at cost  \nplus accrued interest, which generally        \napproximates fair value. As these payables are\nnot accounted for at fair value, they are not \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 through 10. Had these payables been   \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,  \nsubstantially all would have been classified  \nin level 2 as of both September 2021 and      \nDecember 2020. Interest on customer and other \npayables is recognized over the life of the   \ntransaction and included in interest expense. \nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities To reduce   \ncredit exposures on derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter    \ninto master netting agreements or similar     \narrangements (collectively, netting           \nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a      \ncontract with a counterparty that permits net \nsettlement of multiple transactions with that \ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of  \ntermination rights by a non-defaultingparty.  \nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all \ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is \ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with     \nrespect to its derivatives and securities     \nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms  \nof the related credit support agreements or   \nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit    \nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit    \nsupport agreement grants the non-             \ndefaultingparty exercising termination rights \nthe right to liquidate the collateral and     \napply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In    \norder to assess enforceability of the firm\u2019s  \nright of setoff under netting and credit      \nsupport agreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in   \nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the        \nagreement.                                    \n                                              \n  9    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form      \n       10-Q                                   \n                                              \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Derivatives are reported on a net-\nby-counterpartybasis (i.e., the net payable or\nreceivable for derivative assets and          \nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the  \nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting \nagreement. Resale agreements and securities   \nsold under agreements to repurchase           \n(repurchase agreements) and securities        \nborrowed and loaned transactions with the same\nterm and currency are presented on a net-by-  \ncounterpartybasis in the consolidated balance \nsheets when such transactions meet certain    \nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements. In the consolidated balance       \nsheets, derivatives are reported net of cash  \ncollateral received and posted under          \nenforceable credit support agreements, when   \ntransacted under an enforceable netting       \nagreement. In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and         \nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not       \nreported net of the related cash and          \nsecurities received or posted as collateral.  \nSee Note 11 for further information about     \ncollateral received and pledged, including    \nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See \nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about  \noffsetting assets and liabilities. Share-Based\nCompensation The cost of employee services    \nreceived in exchange for a share-based award  \nis generally measured based on the grant-date \nfair value of the award. Share-based awards   \nthat do not require future service (i.e.,     \nvested awards, including awards granted to    \nretirement-eligible employees) are expensed   \nimmediately. Share-based awards that require  \nfuture service are amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recorded when \nthey occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on \nrestricted stock units (RSUs) are generally   \ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that    \nrequire future service are forfeited, the     \nrelated dividend equivalents originally       \ncharged to retained earnings are reclassified \nto compensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues  \nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of   \nshare-based awards. In certain cases,         \nprimarily related to conflicted employment (as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements), \nthe firm may cash settle share-based          \ncompensation awards accounted for as equity   \ninstruments. For these awards, whose terms    \nallow for cash settlement, additional paid-   \nincapital is adjusted to the extent of the    \ndifference between the value of the award at  \nthe time of cash settlement and the grant-date\nvalue of the award. The tax effect related to \nthe settlement of share-based awards is       \nrecorded in income tax benefit or expense.    \nForeign Currency Translation Assets and       \nliabilities denominated in non-U.S.currencies \nare translated at rates of exchange prevailing\non the date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at   \naverage rates of exchange for the period.     \nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies   \nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a  \nnon-U.S.operation, when the functional        \ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are   \nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the     \nconsolidated statements of comprehensive      \nincome. Recent Accounting Developments        \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial     \nInstruments (ASC 326). In June 2016, the FASB \nissued ASU No. 2016-13,\u201cFinancial Instruments \n\u2014 Credit Losses (Topic 326) \u2014 Measurement of  \nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d This \nASU amends several aspects of the measurement \nof credit losses on certain financial         \ninstruments, including replacing the existing \nincurred credit loss model and other models   \nwith the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL)\nmodel and amending certain aspects of         \naccounting for purchased financial assets with\ndeterioration in credit quality since         \norigination. The firm adopted this ASU in     \nJanuary 2020 under a modified retrospective   \napproach. As a result of adopting this ASU,   \nthe firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses on     \nfinancial assets and commitments that are     \nmeasured at amortized cost reflects           \nmanagement\u2019s estimate of credit losses over   \nthe remaining expected life of such assets.   \nExpected credit losses for newly recognized   \nfinancial assets and commitments, as well as  \nchanges to expected credit losses during the  \nperiod, are recognized in earnings. These     \nexpected credit losses are measured based on  \nhistorical experience, current conditions and \nforecasts that affect the collectability of   \nthe reported amount. The cumulative effect of \nmeasuring the allowance under CECL as a result\nof adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020 was\nan increase in the allowance for credit losses\nof $ 848million. The increase in the allowance\nis driven by the fact that the allowance under\nCECL covers expected credit losses over the   \nfull expected life of the loan portfolios and \nalso takes into account forecasts of expected \nfuture economic conditions. In addition, in   \naccordance with the ASU, the firm elected the \nfair value option for loans that were         \npreviously accounted for as Purchased Credit  \nImpaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease  \nto the allowance for PCI loans of $           \n169million. The cumulative effect of adopting \nthis ASU was a decrease to retained earnings  \nof $ 638million (net of tax).                 \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form       10  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In addition, in January 2021 the FASB \nissued ASU No. 2021-01,\u201cReference Rate Reform \n\u2014 Scope,\u201d which clarified the scope of ASC 848\nrelating to contract modifications. The firm  \nadopted these ASUs upon issuance and elected  \nto apply the relief available to certain      \nmodified derivatives. The adoption of these   \nASUs did not have a material impact on the    \nfirm\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Note\n4. Fair Value Measurements The fair value of a\nfinancial instrument is the amount that would \nbe received to sell an asset or paid to       \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid      \nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not  \ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures  \ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a \nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to \nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active  \nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by    \nreference to prices for similar instruments,  \nquoted prices or recent transactions in less  \nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or            \nindependently sourced inputs, including, but  \nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities, \nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding  \nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference       \nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower \ncould finance a given financial instrument    \nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.  \nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for          \ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This   \nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation \ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving \nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based \non the lowest level of input that is          \nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In \nevaluating the significance of a valuation    \ninput, the firm considers, among other        \nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to   \nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as    \nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical, \nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.  \nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are       \nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values \nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial \nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain  \nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and      \nliabilities may require valuation adjustments \nthat a market participant would require to    \narrive at fair value for factors, such as     \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,   \nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments  \nare generally based on market evidence. The   \nvaluation techniques and nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair value of the\nfirm\u2019s financial instruments are described    \nbelow. See Notes 5 through 10 for further     \ninformation about significant unobservable    \ninputs used to value level 3 financial        \ninstruments.                                  \n                                              \n  11    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These instruments are valued \nusing quoted prices for identical unrestricted\ninstruments in active markets. The firm       \ndefines active markets for equity instruments \nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market  \ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm   \ndefines active markets for debt instruments   \nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity. \nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain  \nnon-U.S.government obligations, most agency   \nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and   \nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,  \nmost state and municipal obligations, most    \nmoney market instruments, most other debt     \nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed \nequities, certain private equities,           \ncommodities and certain lending commitments.  \nValuations of level 2 instruments can be      \nverified to quoted prices, recent trading     \nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative    \npricing sources with reasonable levels of     \nprice transparency. Consideration is given to \nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor executable) and the relationship of recent \nmarket activity to the prices provided from   \nalternative pricing sources. Valuation        \nadjustments are typically made to level 2     \ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject  \nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair   \nvalue.

Credit default   \n       swaps that reference indices, large    \n       corporates and major sovereigns        \n       generally exhibit the most price       \n       transparency. For credit default       \n       swaps with other underliers, price     \n       transparency varies based on credit    \n       rating, the cost of borrowing the      \n       underlying reference obligations, and  \n  \u2022    the availability of the underlying     \n       reference obligations for delivery     \n       upon the default of the issuer.        \n       Credit default swaps that reference    \n       loans, asset-backed securities and     \n       emerging market debt instruments tend  \n       to have less price transparency than   \n       those that reference corporate bonds.  \n       In addition, more complex credit       \n       derivatives, such as those sensitive   \n       to the correlation between two or      \n       more underlying reference              \n       obligations, generally have less       \n       price transparency.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  13    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Price transparency      \n       varies based on the underlying         \n  \u2022    commodity, delivery location, tenor    \n       and product quality (e.g., diesel      \n       fuel compared to unleaded gasoline).   \n       In general, price transparency for     \n       commodity derivatives is greater for   \n       contracts with shorter tenors and      \n       contracts that are more closely        \n       aligned with major and/or benchmark    \n       commodity indices.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Equity.Price transparency for equity   \n       derivatives varies by market and       \n       underlier. Options on indices and the  \n       common stock of corporates included    \n       in major equity indices exhibit the    \n       most price transparency.

In addition,    \n  \u2022    the valuation of certain structured    \n       trades requires the use of level\u00a03     \n       correlation inputs, such as the        \n       correlation of the price performance   \n       of two or more individual stocks or    \n       the correlation of the price           \n       performance for a basket of stocks to  \n       another asset class, such as           \n       commodities.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form       14  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Subsequent to the initial         \nvaluation of a level 3 derivative, the firm   \nupdates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to     \nreflect observable market changes and any     \nresulting gains and losses are classified in  \nlevel 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when      \ncorroborated by evidence, such as similar     \nmarket transactions, third-party pricing      \nservices and/or broker or dealer quotations or\nother empirical market data. In circumstances \nwhere the firm cannot verify the model value  \nby reference to market transactions, it is    \npossible that a different valuation model     \ncould produce a materially different estimate \nof fair value. See Note 7 for further         \ninformation about significant unobservable    \ninputs used in the valuation of level 3       \nderivatives. Valuation Adjustments. Valuation \nadjustments are integral to determining the   \nfair value of derivative portfolios and are   \nused to adjust the mid-marketvaluations       \nproduced by derivative pricing models to the  \nexit price valuation. These adjustments       \nincorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of    \nliquidity, and credit and funding valuation   \nadjustments, which account for the credit and \nfunding risk inherent in the uncollateralized \nportion of derivative portfolios. The firm    \nalso makes funding valuation adjustments to   \ncollateralized derivatives where the terms of \nthe agreement do not permit the firm to       \ndeliver or repledge collateral received.      \nMarket-based inputs are generally used when   \ncalibrating valuation adjustments to market-  \nclearing levels. In addition, for derivatives \nthat include significant unobservable inputs, \nthe firm makes model or exit price adjustments\nto account for the valuation uncertainty      \npresent in the transaction. Valuation         \nTechniques and Significant Inputs for Other   \nFinancial Instruments at Fair Value In        \naddition to trading cash instruments,         \nderivatives, and certain investments and      \nloans, the firm accounts for certain of its   \nother financial assets and liabilities at fair\nvalue under the fair value option. Such       \ninstruments include resale and repurchase     \nagreements; certain securities borrowed and   \nloaned transactions; certain customer and     \nother receivables, including certain margin   \nloans; certain time deposits, including       \nstructured certificates of deposit, which are \nhybrid financial instruments; substantially   \nall other secured financings, including       \ntransfers of assets accounted for as          \nfinancings; certain unsecured short- and long-\nterm borrowings, substantially all of which   \nare hybrid financial instruments; and certain \nother liabilities. These instruments are      \ngenerally valued based on discounted cash flow\ntechniques, which incorporate inputs with     \nreasonable levels of price transparency, and  \nare generally classified in level 2 because   \nthe inputs are observable. Valuation          \nadjustments may be made for liquidity and for \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality.   \nThe significant inputs used to value the      \nfirm\u2019s other financial instruments are        \ndescribed below. Resale and Repurchase        \nAgreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of    \nresale and repurchase agreements and          \nsecurities borrowed and loaned are funding    \nspreads, the amount and timing of expected    \nfuture cash flows and interest rates. Customer\nand Other Receivables. The significant inputs \nto the valuation of receivables are interest  \nrates, the amount and timing of expected      \nfuture cash flows and funding spreads.        \nDeposits. The significant inputs to the       \nvaluation of time deposits are interest rates \nand the amount and timing of future cash      \nflows. The inputs used to value the embedded  \nderivative component of hybrid financial      \ninstruments are consistent with the inputs    \nused to value the firm\u2019s other derivative     \ninstruments described above. See Note 7 for   \nfurther information about derivatives and Note\n13 for further information about deposits.    \nOther Secured Financings. The significant     \ninputs to the valuation of other secured      \nfinancings are the amount and timing of       \nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,   \nfunding spreads and the fair value of the     \ncollateral delivered by the firm (determined  \nusing the amount and timing of expected future\ncash flows, market prices, market yields and  \nrecovery assumptions). See Note 11 for further\ninformation about other secured financings.   \nUnsecured Short- and Long-Term Borrowings. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of        \nunsecured short- and long-term borrowings are \nthe amount and timing of expected future cash \nflows, interest rates, the credit spreads of  \nthe firm and commodity prices for prepaid     \ncommodity transactions. The inputs used to    \nvalue the embedded derivative component of    \nhybrid financial instruments are consistent   \nwith the inputs used to value the firm\u2019s other\nderivative instruments described above. See   \nNote 7 for further information about          \nderivatives and Note 14 for further           \ninformation about borrowings. Other           \nLiabilities. The significant inputs to the    \nvaluation of other liabilities are the amount \nand timing of expected future cash flows and  \nequity volatility and correlation inputs. The \ninputs used to value the embedded derivative  \ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are \nconsistent with the inputs used to value the  \nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described \nabove.

For example,  \n       the highest recovery rate for          \n       corporate debt instruments is          \n  \u2022    appropriate for valuing a specific     \n       corporate debt instrument, but may     \n       not be appropriate for valuing any     \n       other corporate debt instrument.       \n       Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do   \n       not represent uncertainty in, or       \n       possible ranges of, fair value         \n       measurements of level\u00a03 trading cash   \n       instruments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increases in yield, duration or        \n       cumulative loss rate used in the       \n       valuation of level\u00a03 trading cash      \n       instruments would have resulted in a   \n       lower fair value measurement, while    \n       increases in recovery rate would have  \n  \u2022    resulted in a higher fair value        \n       measurement as of both September\u00a02021  \n       and December\u00a02020. Due to the          \n       distinctive nature of each level\u00a03     \n       trading cash instrument, the           \n       interrelationship of inputs is not     \n       necessarily uniform

Note 7. Derivatives and Hedging \nActivities Derivative Activities Derivatives  \nare instruments that derive their value from  \nunderlying asset prices, indices, reference   \nrates and other inputs, or a combination of   \nthese factors. Derivatives may be traded on an\nexchange (exchange-traded) or they may be     \nprivately negotiated contracts, which are     \nusually referred to as OTC derivatives.       \nCertain of the firm\u2019s OTC derivatives are     \ncleared and settled through central clearing  \ncounterparties (OTC-cleared),while others are \nbilateral contracts between two counterparties\n(bilateral OTC).                              \nMarket Making. As a\nmarket maker, the firm\nenters into derivative\ntransactions to provide\nliquidity to clients\nand to facilitate the\ntransfer and hedging of\ntheir risks. In this\nrole, the firm\ntypically acts as\nprincipal and is\nrequired to commit\ncapital to provide\nexecution, and\nmaintains market-making\npositions in response\nto, or in anticipation\nof, client demand.\n\nRisk Management. The\nfirm also enters into\nderivatives to actively\nmanage risk exposures\nthat arise from its\nmarket-making and\ninvesting and financing\nactivities. The firm\u2019s\nholdings and exposures\nare hedged, in many\ncases, on either a\nportfolio or risk-\nspecific basis, as\nopposed to an\ninstrument-by-\ninstrumentbasis. The\noffsetting impact of\nthis economic hedging\nis reflected in the\nsame business segment\nas the related\nrevenues. In addition,\nthe firm may enter into\nderivatives designated\nas hedges under U.S.\nGAAP. These derivatives\nare used to manage\ninterest rate exposure\nof certain fixed-rate\nunsecured borrowings\nand deposits, foreign\nexchange risk of\ncertain available-for-\nsalesecurities and the\nnet investment in\ncertain\nnon-U.S.operations, and\nthe price risk of\ncertain commodities.\n\nThe firm enters into\nvarious types of\nderivatives, including:\n                                              \n       Futures and Forwards.Contracts that    \n       commit counterparties to purchase or   \n  \u2022    sell financial instruments,            \n       commodities or currencies in the       \n       future.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Swaps.Contracts that require           \n       counterparties to exchange cash        \n       flows, such as currency or interest    \n       payment streams. The amounts           \n  \u2022    exchanged are based on the specific    \n       terms of the contract with reference   \n       to specified rates, financial          \n       instruments, commodities, currencies   \n       or indices.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Options.Contracts in which the option  \n       purchaser has the right, but not the   \n       obligation, to purchase from or sell   \n  \u2022    to the option writer financial         \n       instruments, commodities or            \n       currencies within a defined time       \n       period for a specified price.          \n                                              \nDerivatives are\nreported on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for\nderivative assets and\nliabilities for a given\ncounterparty) when a\nlegal right of setoff\nexists under an\nenforceable netting\nagreement (counterparty\nnetting). Derivatives\nare accounted for at\nfair value, net of cash\ncollateral received or\nposted under\nenforceable credit\nsupport agreements\n(cash collateral\nnetting).

For example, the highest   \n       correlation for interest rate          \n       derivatives is appropriate for         \n  \u2022    valuing a specific interest rate       \n       derivative but may not be appropriate  \n       for valuing any other interest rate    \n       derivative.

Credit\nderivatives are\ngenerally individually\nnegotiated contracts\nand can have various\nsettlement and payment\nconventions. Credit\nevents include failure\nto pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of\nindebtedness,\nrestructuring,\nrepudiation and\ndissolution of the\nreference entity.\n\nThe firm enters into\nthe following types of\ncredit derivatives:\n                                              \n       Credit Default Swaps.Single-name       \n       credit default swaps protect the       \n       buyer against the loss of principal    \n       on one or more bonds, loans or         \n       mortgages (reference obligations) in   \n       the event the issuer of the reference  \n       obligations suffers a credit event.    \n       The buyer of protection pays an        \n       initial or periodic premium to the     \n  \u2022    seller and receives protection for     \n       the period of the contract. If there   \n       is no credit event, as defined in the  \n       contract, the seller of protection     \n       makes no payments to the buyer. If a   \n       credit event occurs, the seller of     \n       protection is required to make a       \n       payment to the buyer, calculated       \n       according to the terms of the          \n       contract.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit Options.In a credit option,     \n       the option writer assumes the          \n       obligation to purchase or sell a       \n       reference obligation at a specified    \n       price or credit spread. The option     \n       purchaser buys the right, but does     \n  \u2022    not assume the obligation, to sell     \n       the reference obligation to, or        \n       purchase it from, the option writer.   \n       The payments on credit options depend  \n       either on a particular credit spread   \n       or the price of the reference          \n       obligation.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form       26  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

If a credit event occurs in     \n       one of the underlying reference        \n       obligations, the protection seller     \n       pays the protection buyer. The         \n       payment is typically apro-rataportion  \n       of the transaction\u2019s total notional    \n  \u2022    amount based on the underlying         \n       defaulted reference obligation. In     \n       certain transactions, the credit risk  \n       of a basket or index is separated      \n       into various portions (tranches),      \n       each having different levels of        \n       subordination. The most junior         \n       tranches cover initial defaults and    \n       once losses exceed the notional        \n       amount of these junior tranches, any   \n       excess loss is covered by the next     \n       most senior tranche.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Total Return Swaps.A total return      \n       swap transfers the risks relating to   \n       economic performance of a reference    \n       obligation from the protection buyer   \n       to the protection seller. Typically,   \n       the protection buyer receives a        \n  \u2022    floating rate of interest and          \n       protection against any reduction in    \n       fair value of the reference            \n       obligation, and the protection seller  \n       receives the cash flows associated     \n       with the reference obligation, plus    \n       any increase in the fair value of the  \n       reference obligation.                  \n                                              \nThe firm economically\nhedges its exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a\nparticular written\ncredit derivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default.\n\nAs of September\u00a02021,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $ 564.94\nbillion and purchased\ncredit derivatives had\na total gross notional\namount of $ 612.88\nbillion, for total net\nnotional purchased\nprotection of $ 47.94\nbillion.

These\ninterest rate swaps\nhedge changes in fair\nvalue attributable to\nthe designated\nbenchmark interest rate\n(e.g., London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR),\nSecured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR)\nor Overnight Index Swap\nRate), effectively\nconverting a\nsubstantial portion of\nfixed-rate obligations\ninto floating-rate\nobligations.\nThe firm applies a\nstatistical method that\nutilizes regression\nanalysis when assessing\nthe effectiveness of\nthese hedging\nrelationships in\nachieving offsetting\nchanges in the fair\nvalues of the hedging\ninstrument and the risk\nbeing hedged (i.e.,\ninterest rate risk). An\ninterest rate swap is\nconsidered highly\neffective in offsetting\nchanges in fair value\nattributable to changes\nin the hedged risk when\nthe regression analysis\nresults in a\ncoefficient of\ndetermination of 80% or\ngreater and a slope\nbetween 80% and 125%.\n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form       28  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The losses\non the hedges (relating\nto both spot and\nforward points) and the\nforeign exchange gains\non the related\navailable-for-sale\nsecurities were\nincluded in market\nmaking and were not\nmaterial for both the\nthree and nine months\nended September\u00a02021\nand September\u00a02020.\n\nDuring the second\nquarter of 2021, the\nfirm designated\ncommodity futures\ncontracts as fair value\nhedges of the price\nrisk of certain\nprecious metals\nincluded in commodities\nwithin trading assets.\nAs of September\u00a02021,\nthe carrying value of\nsuch commodities was $\n1.00 billion and the\namortized cost was $\n1.04 billion. Changes\nin spot rates of such\ncommodities are\nreflected as an\nadjustment to their\ncarrying value, and the\nrelated gains/(losses)\non both the commodities\nand the designated\nfutures contracts are\nincluded in market\nmaking. The contractual\nforward points on the\ndesignated futures\ncontracts are amortized\ninto earnings ratably\nover the life of the\ncontract and other\ngains/(losses) as a\nresult of changes in\nthe forward points are\nincluded in other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss). The\ncumulative hedging\nadjustment was not\nmaterial as of\nSeptember\u00a02021 and the\nrelated gains/(losses)\nwere not material for\nboth the three and nine\nmonths ended\nSeptember\u00a02021.\nNet Investment Hedges                         \nThe firm seeks to\nreduce the impact of\nfluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates on its\nnet investments in\ncertain non-U.S.\noperations through the\nuse of foreign currency\nforward contracts and\nforeign currency-\ndenominated debt. For\nforeign currency\nforward contracts\ndesignated as hedges,\nthe effectiveness of\nthe hedge is assessed\nbased on the overall\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of the forward\ncontracts (i.e., based\non changes in forward\nrates). For foreign\ncurrency-denominated\ndebt designated as a\nhedge, the\neffectiveness of the\nhedge is assessed based\non changes in spot\nrates. For qualifying\nnet investment hedges,\nall gains or losses on\nthe hedging instruments\nare included in\ncurrency translation.\n\nThe table below\npresents the\ngains/(losses) from net\ninvestment hedging.\n                                              \n         Thr\u2026                Nine             \n         Mon\u2026               Mont\u2026             \n         End\u2026               Ended             \n         Sep\u2026               Sept\u2026             \n  $                                           \n  in\u00a0    2021    2020        2021    2020     \n  mi\u2026                                         \n  He\u2026                                         \n  Fo\u2026                                         \n  cu\u2026    $373    $(2\u2026  )     $600       $     \n  fo\u2026                                 387     \n  co\u2026                                         \n  Fo\u2026                                         \n  cu\u2026     $31    $(1\u2026  )     $290    $(1\u2026  )  \n  de\u2026                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  29    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP,  \n INC.

value of any one  \n       investment. For example, the highest   \n       multiple for private equity            \n  \u2022    securities is appropriate for valuing  \n       a specific private equity security     \n       but may not be appropriate for         \n       valuing any other private equity       \n       security. Accordingly, the ranges of   \n       inputs do not represent uncertainty    \n       in, or possible ranges of, fair value  \n       measurements of level\u00a03 investments.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increases in yield, discount rate,     \n       capitalization rate or duration used   \n       in the valuation of level\u00a03            \n       investments would have resulted in a   \n       lower fair value measurement, while    \n       increases in recovery rate or          \n  \u2022    multiples would have resulted in a     \n       higher fair value measurement as of    \n       both September\u00a02021 and December\u00a0      \n       2020. Due to the distinctive nature    \n       of each level\u00a03 investment, the        \n       interrelationship of inputs is not     \n       necessarily uniform within each        \n       product type.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Corporate debt securities, securities  \n       backed by real estate and other debt   \n       obligations are valued using           \n  \u2022    discounted cash flows, and equity      \n       securities are valued using market     \n       comparables and discounted cash        \n       flows.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       The fair value of any one instrument   \n       may be determined using multiple       \n       valuation techniques. For example,     \n  \u2022    market comparables and discounted      \n       cash flows may be used together to     \n       determine fair value. Therefore, the   \n       level\u00a03 balance encompasses both of    \n       these techniques.                      \n                                              \nLevel 3 Rollforward                           \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level 3\ninvestments.\n                                              \n        Th\u2026                 Ni\u2026               \n        Mo\u2026                 Mo\u2026               \n        En\u2026                 En\u2026               \n        Se\u2026                 Se\u2026               \n  $                                           \n  in    20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026     \n  m\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026    $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026     78       128       184       238     \n  g\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  u\u2026    155       534       1,\u2026       (8\u2026  )  \n  g\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    496       405       1,\u2026       1,\u2026     \n  S\u2026    (4\u2026  )    (2\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )  \n  S\u2026    (8\u2026  )    (6\u2026  )    (2\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )  \n  T\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026    806       230       1,\u2026       5,\u2026     \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  T\u2026                                          \n  o\u2026                                          \n  of    (2\u2026  )    (9\u2026  )    (3\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )  \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  E\u2026    $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       Changes in fair value are presented    \n  \u2022    for all investments that are           \n       classified in level\u00a03 as of the end    \n       of the period.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates  \n  \u2022    to investments that were still held    \n       atperiod-end.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Transfers between levels of the fair   \n       value hierarchy are reported at the    \n       beginning of the reporting period in   \n  \u2022    which they occur.

Loans accounted\nfor at amortized cost\n(other than credit card\nloans) are placed on\nnonaccrual status when\nit is probable that the\nfirm will not collect\nall principal and\ninterest due under the\ncontractual terms,\nregardless of the\ndelinquency status or\nif a loan is past due\nfor 90 days or more,\nunless the loan is both\nwell collateralized and\nin the process of\ncollection. At that\ntime, all accrued but\nuncollected interest is\nreversed against\ninterest income and\ninterest subsequently\ncollected is recognized\non a cash basis to the\nextent the loan balance\nis deemed collectible.\nOtherwise, all cash\nreceived is used to\nreduce the outstanding\nloan balance. A loan is\nconsidered past due\nwhen a principal or\ninterest payment has\nnot been made according\nto its contractual\nterms. Credit card\nloans are not placed on\nnonaccrual status and\naccrue interest until\nthe loan is paid in\nfull or is charged off.\n\nIn certain\ncircumstances, the firm\nmay modify the original\nterms of a loan\nagreement by granting a\nconcession to a\nborrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty,\ntypically in the form\nof a modification of\nloan covenants, but may\nalso include\nforbearance of interest\nor principal, payment\nextensions or interest\nrate reductions. These\nmodifications, to the\nextent significant, are\nconsidered troubled\ndebt restructurings\n(TDRs). Loan\nmodifications that\nextend payment terms\nfor a period of less\nthan 90\u00a0days are\ngenerally considered\ninsignificant and\ntherefore not reported\nas TDRs.\n\nThe firm adopted the\nrelief issued under the\nCoronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic\nSecurity Act, as\namended, and certain\ninterpretive guidance\nissued by the U.S.\nbanking agencies that\nprovides for certain\nmodified loans that\nwould otherwise meet\nthe definition of a TDR\nto not be classified as\nsuch.

To determine the \nallowance for credit losses, the firm         \nclassifies its loans and lending commitments  \naccounted for at amortized cost into wholesale\nand consumer portfolios. These portfolios     \nrepresent the level at which the firm has     \ndeveloped and documented its methodology to   \ndetermine the allowance for credit losses. The\nallowance for credit losses is measured on a  \ncollective basis for loans that exhibit       \nsimilar risk characteristics using a modeled  \napproach and asset-specific basis for loans   \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics. The allowance for credit     \nlosses takes into account the weighted average\nof a range of forecasts of future economic    \nconditions over the expected life of the loan \nand lending commitments. The expected life of \neach loan or lending commitment is determined \nbased on the contractual term adjusted for    \nextension options or demand features. The     \nforecasts include baseline, favorable and     \nadverse economic scenarios over a three-year  \nperiod. For loans with expected lives beyond  \nthree years, the model reverts to historical  \nloss information based on a non-linearmodeled \napproach. The forecasted economic scenarios   \nconsider a number of risk factors relevant to \nthe wholesale and consumer portfolios         \ndescribed below. The firm applies judgment in \nweighing individual scenarios each quarter    \nbased on a variety of factors, including the  \nfirm\u2019s internally derived economic outlook,   \nmarket consensus, recent macroeconomic        \nconditions and industry trends.

The allowance   \nfor credit losses for wholesale loans and     \nlending commitments that exhibit similar risk \ncharacteristics is measured using a modeled   \napproach. These models determine the          \nprobability of default and loss given default \nbased on various risk factors, including      \ninternal credit ratings, industry default and \nloss data, expected life, macroeconomic       \nindicators, the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet   \nits financial obligations, the borrower\u2019s     \ncountry of risk and industry, loan seniority  \nand collateral type. For lending commitments, \nthe methodology also considers probability of \ndrawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans  \nbacked by real estate, risk factors include   \nthe loan-to-valueratio, debt service ratio and\nhome price index. The most significant inputs \nto the forecast model for wholesale loans and \nlending commitments include unemployment      \nrates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and    \nindustrial delinquency rates, short- and long-\nterm interest rates, and oil prices. The      \nallowance for loan losses for wholesale loans \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics, such as nonaccrual loans or  \nloans in a TDR, is calculated using the       \npresent value of expected future cash flows   \ndiscounted at the loan\u2019s original effective   \nrate, the observable market price of the loan \nor the fair value of the collateral. Wholesale\nloans are charged off against the allowance   \nfor loan losses when deemed to be             \nuncollectible. Consumer. The allowance for    \ncredit losses for consumer loans that exhibit \nsimilar risk characteristics is calculated    \nusing a modeled approach which classifies     \nconsumer loans into pools based on borrower-  \nrelated and exposure-related characteristics  \nthat differentiate a pool\u2019s risk              \ncharacteristics from other pools. The factors \nconsidered in determining a pool are generally\nconsistent with the risk characteristics used \nfor internal credit risk measurement and      \nmanagement and include key metrics, such as   \nFICO credit scores, delinquency status, loan  \nvintage and macroeconomic indicators. The most\nsignificant inputs to the forecast model for  \nconsumer loans include unemployment rates and \ndelinquency rates. The expected life of       \nrevolving credit card loans is determined by  \nmodeling expected future draws and the timing \nand amount of repayments allocated to the     \nfunded balance. The firm also recognizes an   \nallowance for credit losses on commitments to \nacquire loans. However, no allowance for      \ncredit losses is recognized on credit card    \nlending commitments as they are cancellable by\nthe firm. The allowance for credit losses for \nconsumer loans that do not share similar risk \ncharacteristics, such as loans in a TDR, is   \ncalculated using the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s    \noriginal effective rate.                      \n                                              \n  41    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP,  \n INC.

In addition, the provision  \nfor credit losses for wholesale loans was     \nimpacted by asset-specific provisions and     \nratings downgrades primarily related to       \nborrowers in the technology, media &          \ntelecommunications, diversified industrials,  \nand natural resources industries. Besides the \nweaker economic outlook related to the        \nCOVID-19pandemic, the provision for credit    \nlosses for consumer loans for the nine months \nended September 2020 was also impacted by the \ncontinued seasoning of the credit card        \nportfolio. Net (charge-offs)/recoveries for   \nthe nine months ended September 2020 for      \nwholesale loans were substantially all related\nto corporate loans and net (charge-           \noffs)/recoveries for consumer loans were      \nprimarily related to installment loans.       \n                                              \n  43    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP,  \n INC.

Due to the distinctive nature    \n       of each level\u00a03 loan, the              \n       interrelationship of inputs is not     \n       necessarily uniform within each        \n       product type.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Loans are valued using discounted      \n       cash flows.                            \n                                              \nLevel 3 Rollforward                           \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level\u00a03\nloans.\n                                              \n        Th\u2026                 Ni\u2026               \n        Mo\u2026                 Mo\u2026               \n        En\u2026                 En\u2026               \n        Se\u2026                 Se\u2026               \n  $                                           \n  in    20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026     \n  m\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026    $2\u2026       $2\u2026       $2\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026     23        23        72        60     \n  g\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  u\u2026    (16  )     76       (31  )     34     \n  g\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026     74       181       140       557     \n  S\u2026    (13  )    (17  )    (17  )    (31  )  \n  S\u2026    (1\u2026  )    (2\u2026  )    (5\u2026  )    (5\u2026  )  \n  T\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026     93       166       181       928     \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  T\u2026                                          \n  o\u2026                                          \n  of    (10  )    (40  )    (2\u2026  )    (44  )  \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  E\u2026    $2\u2026       $2\u2026       $2\u2026       $2\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       Changes in fair value are presented    \n  \u2022    for loans that are classified in       \n       level\u00a03 as of the end of the period.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates  \n  \u2022    to loans that were still held          \n       atperiod-end.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Purchases includes originations and    \n       secondary purchases.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Transfers between levels of the fair   \n       value hierarchy are reported at the    \n       beginning of the reporting period in   \n  \u2022    which they occur.

See\nNote\u00a018 for further\ninformation about\nlending commitments.\n\nImpact of Credit\nSpreads on Loans and\nLending Commitments\n\nThe estimated net\ngain/(loss)\nattributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads on loans and\nlending commitments\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected was $ 87\nmillion for the three\nmonths ended\nSeptember\u00a02021, $ 73\nmillion for the three\nmonths ended\nSeptember\u00a02020, $ 290\nmillion for the nine\nmonths ended\nSeptember\u00a02021 and $(\n151 )\u00a0million for the\nnine months ended\nSeptember\u00a02020. The\nfirm generally\ncalculates the fair\nvalue of loans and\nlending commitments\nfor which the fair\nvalue option is\nelected by discounting\nfuture cash flows at a\nrate which\nincorporates the\ninstrument-specific\ncredit spreads. For\nfloating-rate loans\nand lending\ncommitments,\nsubstantially all\nchanges in fair value\nare attributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads, whereas for\nfixed-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nchanges in fair value\nare also attributable\nto changes in interest\nrates.\nNote 11. Collateralized Agreements and        \nFinancings Collateralized agreements are      \nresale agreements and securities borrowed.    \nCollateralized financings are repurchase      \nagreements, securities loaned and other       \nsecured financings. The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things, \nfacilitate client activities, invest excess   \ncash, acquire securities to cover short       \npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings are  \npresented on a net-by-counterpartybasis when a\nlegal right of setoff exists. Interest on     \ncollateralized agreements, which is included  \nin interest income, and collateralized        \nfinancings, which is included in interest     \nexpense, is recognized over the life of the   \ntransaction. See Note 23 for further          \ninformation about interest income and interest\nexpense. Resale and Repurchase Agreements A   \nresale agreement is a transaction in which the\nfirm purchases financial instruments from a   \nseller, typically in exchange for cash, and   \nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to    \nresell the same or substantially the same     \nfinancial instruments to the seller at a      \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. A repurchase agreement is a transaction \nin which the firm sells financial instruments \nto a buyer, typically in exchange for cash,   \nand simultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same \nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a     \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale       \nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d)involve the legal transfer of       \nownership of financial instruments, they are  \naccounted for as financing arrangements       \nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the  \nmaturity of the agreement. The financial      \ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and   \nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.  \ngovernment and agency, and investment-grade   \nsovereign obligations. The firm receives      \nfinancial instruments purchased under resale  \nagreements and makes delivery of financial    \ninstruments sold under repurchase agreements. \nTo mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these financial           \ninstruments on a daily basis, and delivers or \nobtains additional collateral due to changes  \nin the market value of the financial          \ninstruments, as appropriate. For resale       \nagreements, the firm typically requires       \ncollateral with a fair value approximately    \nequal to the carrying value of the relevant   \nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.    \n                                              \n  51    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP,  \n INC.

Alternatively, a  \nquantitative goodwill test can be performed   \nwithout performing a qualitative assessment.  \nThe quantitative goodwill test compares the   \nestimated fair value of each reporting unit   \nwith its estimated net book value (including  \ngoodwill and identifiable intangible assets). \nIf the reporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value  \nexceeds its estimated net book value, goodwill\nis not impaired. An impairment is recognized  \nif the estimated fair value of a reporting    \nunit is less than its estimated net book      \nvalue. To estimate the fair value of each     \nreporting unit, other than Consumer banking, a\nrelative value technique is used because the  \nfirm believes market participants would use   \nthis technique to value these reporting units.\nThe relative value technique applies          \nobservable price-to-earningsmultiples or      \nprice-to-bookmultiples of comparable          \ncompetitors to reporting units\u2019 net earnings  \nor net book value. To estimate the fair value \nof Consumer banking, a discounted cash flow   \nvaluation approach is used because the firm   \nbelieves market participants would use this   \ntechnique to value that reporting unit given  \nits early stage of development. The estimated \nnet carrying value of each reporting unit     \nreflects an allocation of total shareholders\u2019 \nequity and represents the estimated amount of \ntotal shareholders\u2019 equity required to support\nthe activities of the reporting unit under    \ncurrently applicable regulatory capital       \nrequirements. In the fourth quarter of 2020,  \nthe firm performed its annual assessment of   \ngoodwill for impairment, for each of its      \nreporting units, by performing a qualitative  \nassessment. Multiple factors, including       \nperformance indicators, macroeconomic         \nindicators, firm and industry events, and fair\nvalue indicators, were assessed with respect  \nto each of the firm\u2019s reporting units to      \ndetermine whether it was more likely than not \nthat the estimated fair value of any of these \nreporting units was less than its estimated   \ncarrying value. The qualitative assessment    \nalso considered changes since the quantitative\ntest performed in the fourth quarter of 2019. \nAs a result of the qualitative assessment, the\nfirm determined that it was more likely than  \nnot that the estimated fair value of each of  \nthe reporting units exceeded its respective   \nestimated carrying value. Therefore, the firm \ndetermined that goodwill for each reporting   \nunit was not impaired and that a quantitative \ngoodwill test was not required.               \nThere were no events or\nchanges in\ncircumstances during\nthe nine months ended\nSeptember\u00a02021 that\nwould indicate that it\nwas more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of each of\nthe reporting units did\nnot exceed its\nrespective estimated\ncarrying value as of\nSeptember\u00a02021.\nIdentifiable Intangible                       \nAssets                                        \nThe table below\npresents identifiable\nintangible assets by\nreporting unit and\ntype.\n                                              \n                    As of                     \n  $ in\u00a0        September\u2026        December     \n  millions                           2020     \n  By                                          \n  Reporting                                   \n  Unit                                        \n  Global                                      \n  Markets:                                    \n  FICC                 $1               $     \n                                        2     \n  Equities             43              45     \n  Asset               180             274     \n  Manageme\u2026                                   \n  Consumer\u00a0                                   \n  & Wealth                                    \n  Manageme\u2026                                   \n  Consumer              \u2013               6     \n  banking                                     \n  Wealth              273             303     \n  manageme\u2026                                   \n  Total              $497        $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0630     \n  By Type                                     \n  Customer                                    \n  lists                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  carrying         $1,472         $\u00a01,478     \n  value                                       \n  Accumula\u2026        (1,123  )       (1,089  )  \n  amortiza\u2026                                   \n  Net                                         \n  carrying            349             389     \n  value                                       \n  Acquired                                    \n  leases                                      \n  and other                                   \n  Gross                                       \n  carrying            576             710     \n  value                                       \n  Accumula\u2026          (428  )         (469  )  \n  amortiza\u2026                                   \n  Net                                         \n  carrying            148             241     \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  gross             2,048           2,188     \n  carrying                                    \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  accumula\u2026        (1,551  )       (1,558  )  \n  amortiza\u2026                                   \n  Total net                                   \n  carrying           $497        $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0630     \n  value                                       \n                                              \nDuring the nine months\nended September\u00a02021,\nthe amount of\nintangible assets\nacquired by the firm\nwas not material.

The Trust issued $  \n2.75billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial\ninterests (Trust Preferred securities) to     \nthird parties and $ 85million of common       \nbeneficial interests to Group Inc. As of both \nSeptember 2021 and December 2020, the         \noutstanding par amount of junior subordinated \ndebt held by the Trust was $ 968million and   \nthe outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred \nsecurities and common beneficial interests    \nissued by the Trust was $ 939million and $    \n29million, respectively. The Trust is a       \nwholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm   \nfor regulatory and legal purposes but is not  \nconsolidated for accounting purposes. The firm\npays interest semi-annually on the junior     \nsubordinated debt at an annual rate of 6.345% \nand the debt matures on February 15, 2034. The\ncoupon rate and the payment dates applicable  \nto the beneficial interests are the same as   \nthe interest rate and payment dates for the   \njunior subordinated debt. The firm has the    \nright, from time to time, to defer payment of \ninterest on the junior subordinated debt, and \ntherefore cause payment on the Trust\u2019s        \npreferred beneficial interests to be deferred,\nin each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual\nperiods. During any such deferral period, the \nfirm will not be permitted to, among other    \nthings, pay dividends on or make certain      \nrepurchases of its common stock. The Trust is \nnot permitted to pay any distributions on the \ncommon beneficial interests held by Group Inc.\nunless all dividends payable on the preferred \nbeneficial interests have been paid in full.  \nThe firm has covenanted in favor of the       \nholders of Group Inc.\u2019s 6.345% junior         \nsubordinated debt due February 15, 2034, that,\nsubject to certain exceptions, the firm will  \nnot redeem or purchase the capital securities \nissued by Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman\nSachs Capital III (APEX Trusts) or shares of  \nGroup Inc.\u2019s Perpetual Non-CumulativePreferred\nStock, Series E (Series E Preferred Stock),   \nPerpetual Non-CumulativePreferred Stock,      \nSeries F (Series F Preferred Stock) or        \nPerpetual Non-CumulativePreferred Stock,      \nSeries O, if the redemption or purchase       \nresults in less than $ 253million aggregate   \nliquidation preference of that series         \noutstanding, prior to specified dates in 2022 \nfor a price that exceeds a maximum amount     \ndetermined by reference to the net cash       \nproceeds that the firm has received from the  \nsale of qualifying securities.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) The firm reassesses its evaluation\nof whether an entity is a VIE when certain    \nreconsideration events occur. The firm        \nreassesses its determination of whether it is \nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and              \ncircumstances. VIE Activities The firm is     \nprincipally involved with VIEs through the    \nfollowing business activities: Mortgage-Backed\nVIEs. The firm sells residential and          \ncommercial mortgage loans and securities to   \nmortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial\ninterests in the assets sold to these VIEs.   \nThe firm purchases and sells beneficial       \ninterests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in   \nconnection with market-making activities. In  \naddition, the firm may enter into derivatives \nwith certain of these VIEs, primarily interest\nrate swaps, which are typically not variable  \ninterests. The firm generally enters into     \nderivatives with other counterparties to      \nmitigate its risk. Real Estate, Credit- and   \nPower-Related and Other Investing VIEs. The   \nfirm purchases equity and debt securities     \nissued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold   \nreal estate, performing and nonperforming     \ndebt, distressed loans, power-related assets  \nand equity securities. The firm generally does\nnot sell assets to, or enter into derivatives \nwith, these VIEs. Corporate Debt and Other    \nAsset-Backed VIEs. The firm structures VIEs   \nthat issue notes to clients, purchases and    \nsells beneficial interests issued by corporate\ndebt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection\nwith market-making activities, and makes loans\nto VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain\nof these VIEs synthetically create the        \nexposure for the beneficial interests they    \nissue by entering into credit derivatives with\nthe firm, rather than purchasing the          \nunderlying assets. In addition, the firm may  \nenter into derivatives, such as total return  \nswaps, with certain corporate debt and other  \nasset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays  \nthe VIE a return due to the beneficial        \ninterest holders and receives the return on   \nthe collateral owned by the VIE. The          \ncollateral owned by these VIEs is primarily   \nother asset-backed loans and securities. The  \nfirm may be removed as the total return swap  \ncounterparty and may enter into derivatives   \nwith other counterparties to mitigate its risk\nrelated to these swaps. The firm may sell     \nassets to the corporate debt and other asset- \nbacked VIEs it structures.                    \nPrincipal-Protected\nNote VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs own\nportfolios of assets,\nprincipally with\nexposure to hedge\nfunds. Substantially\nall of the principal\nprotection on the notes\nissued by these VIEs is\nprovided by the asset\nportfolio rebalancing\nthat is required under\nthe terms of the notes.\nThe firm enters into\ntotal return swaps with\nthese VIEs under which\nthe firm pays the VIE\nthe return due to the\nprincipal-protected\nnote holders and\nreceives the return on\nthe assets owned by the\nVIE. The firm may enter\ninto derivatives with\nother counterparties to\nmitigate its risk. The\nfirm also obtains\nfunding through these\nVIEs.\n\nInvestments in Funds.\nThe firm makes equity\ninvestments in certain\ninvestment fund VIEs it\nmanages and is entitled\nto receive fees from\nthese VIEs. The firm\nhas generally not sold\nassets to, or entered\ninto derivatives with,\nthese VIEs.\nNonconsolidated VIEs                          \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe nonconsolidated\nVIEs in which the firm\nholds variable\ninterests.\n                                              \n                        As of                 \n  $ in\u00a0millions     September           2020  \n                         2021                 \n  Total                                       \n  nonconsolidat\u2026                              \n  VIEs                                        \n  Assets in VIEs     $169,664       $148,665  \n  Carrying value                              \n  of variable         $10,126     $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08,624  \n  interests \u2014                                 \n  assets                                      \n  Carrying value                              \n  of variable            $826    $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0888  \n  interests \u2014                                 \n  liabilities                                 \n  Maximum                                     \n  exposure to                                 \n  loss:                                       \n  Retained             $3,623     $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03,182  \n  interests                                   \n  Purchased             1,055          1,041  \n  interests                                   \n  Commitments           3,304          2,455  \n  and guarantees                              \n  Derivatives           8,958          8,343  \n  Debt and              5,142          4,020  \n  equity                                      \n  Total               $22,082      $\u00a0\u00a019,041  \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       The nature of the firm\u2019s variable      \n  \u2022    interests is described in the rows     \n       under maximum exposure to loss.        \n                                              \n                                              \n       The firm\u2019s exposure to the             \n       obligations of VIEs is generally       \n       limited to its interests in these      \n  \u2022    entities.

The firm has\nconcluded that these\nconditions have been\nmet for certain large,\ninternationally active\ncommercial and\ninvestment bank\ncounterparties, central\nclearing\ncounterparties, hedge\nfunds and certain other\ncounterparties.\nAccordingly, the firm\nhas not included such\ncontracts in the table\nabove. See Note 7 for\ninformation about\ncredit derivatives that\nmeet the definition of\na guarantee, which are\nnot included in the\ntable above.\n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form       68  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Derivatives are accounted for at  \nfair value and therefore the carrying value is\nconsidered the best indication of             \npayment/performance risk for individual       \ncontracts. However, the carrying values in the\ntable above exclude the effect of counterparty\nand cash collateral netting. Securities       \nLending and Clearing Guarantees. Securities   \nlending and clearing guarantees include the   \nindemnifications and guarantees that the firm \nprovides in its capacity as an agency lender  \nand in its capacity as a sponsoring member of \nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. As an  \nagency lender, the firm indemnifies most of   \nits securities lending customers against      \nlosses incurred in the event that borrowers do\nnot return securities and the collateral held \nis insufficient to cover the market value of  \nthe securities borrowed. The maximum payout of\nsuch indemnifications was $ 12.48billion as of\nSeptember 2021 and $ 19.86billion as of       \nDecember 2020. Collateral held by the lenders \nin connection with securities lending         \nindemnifications was $ 12.87billion as of     \nSeptember 2021 and $ 20.39billion as of       \nDecember 2020. Because the contractual nature \nof these arrangements requires the firm to    \nobtain collateral with a market value that    \nexceeds the value of the securities lent to   \nthe borrower, there is minimal performance    \nrisk associated with these indemnifications.  \nAs a sponsoring member of the Government      \nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income       \nClearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the \nperformance of its sponsored member clients to\nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in      \nconnection with certain resale and repurchase \nagreements. To minimize potential losses on   \nsuch guarantees, the firm obtains a security  \ninterest in the collateral that the sponsored \nclient placed with the Fixed Income Clearing  \nCorporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on   \nsuch guarantees is minimal. There were no     \namounts outstanding under the guarantee as of \nSeptember 2021. As of December 2020, the      \nmaximum payout on this guarantee was $        \n1.49billion and the related collateral held   \nwas $ 1.50billion. Other Financial Guarantees.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the firm  \nprovides other financial guarantees of the    \nobligations of third parties (e.g., standby   \nletters of credit and other guarantees to     \nenable clients to complete transactions and   \nfund-related guarantees). These guarantees    \nrepresent obligations to make payments to     \nbeneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to\nfulfill its obligation under a contractual    \narrangement with that beneficiary. Other      \nfinancial guarantees also include a guarantee \nthat the firm has provided to the Government  \nof Malaysia that it will receive at least $   \n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets \nseized by governmental authorities around the \nworld related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad,\na sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB).   \nThe firm evaluates progress toward satisfying \nthis obligation based on the report that it   \nreceives on a semi-annual basis, expected in  \nFebruary and August. Based on the latest      \nreport as of August 2021, approximately $     \n450million in assets or proceeds from assets  \nhas been returned to the Government of        \nMalaysia in connection with this guarantee,   \nwhich must be satisfied by August 18, 2025.   \nAny amounts paid by the firm under this       \nguarantee would be subject to reimbursement in\nthe event the assets or proceeds received by  \nthe Government of Malaysia through August 18, \n2028 exceeds $ 1.4billion. See Note 27 for    \nfurther information about matters related to  \n1MDB. Guarantees of Securities Issued by      \nTrusts. The firm has established trusts,      \nincluding Goldman Sachs Capital I, the APEX   \nTrusts and other entities, for the limited    \npurpose of issuing securities to third        \nparties, lending the proceeds to the firm and \nentering into contractual arrangements with   \nthe firm and third parties related to this    \npurpose. The firm does not consolidate these  \nentities. See Note 14 for further information \nabout the transactions involving Goldman Sachs\nCapital I and the APEX Trusts.The firm        \neffectively provides for the full and         \nunconditional guarantee of the securities     \nissued by these entities. Timely payment by   \nthe firm of amounts due to these entities     \nunder the guarantee, borrowing, preferred     \nstock and related contractual arrangements    \nwill be sufficient to cover payments due on   \nthe securities issued by these entities. No   \nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the       \nsecurities of Goldman Sachs Capital I or the  \nAPEX Trusts. Management believes that it is   \nunlikely that any circumstances will occur,   \nsuch as nonperformance on the part of paying  \nagents or other service providers, that would \nmake it necessary for the firm to make        \npayments related to these entities other than \nthose required under the terms of the         \nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and     \nrelated contractual arrangements and in       \nconnection with certain expenses incurred by  \nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of \nService Providers. In the ordinary course of  \nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees \ncertain service providers, such as clearing   \nand custody agents, trustees and              \nadministrators, against specified potential   \nlosses in connection with their acting as an  \nagent of, or providing services to, the firm  \nor its affiliates.                            \n                                              \n  69    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) The firm may also be liable to    \nsome clients or other parties for losses      \narising from its custodial role or caused by  \nacts or omissions of third-party service      \nproviders, including sub-custodiansand third- \nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has \nthe right to seek indemnification from these  \nthird-party service providers for certain     \nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In      \naddition, the firm is a member of payment,    \nclearing and settlement networks, as well as  \nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of   \nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of   \nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In  \nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear \nand settle on behalf of its clients the       \ntransactions entered into by them with other  \nbrokerage firms. The firm\u2019s obligations in    \nrespect of such transactions are secured by   \nthe assets in the client\u2019s account, as well as\nany proceeds received from the transactions   \ncleared and settled by the firm on behalf of  \nthe client. In connection with joint venture  \ninvestments, the firm may issue loan          \nguarantees under which it may be liable in the\nevent of fraud, misappropriation,             \nenvironmental liabilities and certain other   \nmatters involving the borrower. The firm is   \nunable to develop an estimate of the maximum  \npayout under these guarantees and             \nindemnifications. However, management believes\nthat it is unlikely the firm will have to make\nany material payments under these             \narrangements, and no material liabilities     \nrelated to these guarantees and               \nindemnifications have been recognized in the  \nconsolidated balance sheets as of both        \nSeptember 2021 and December 2020. Other       \nRepresentations, Warranties and               \nIndemnifications. The firm provides           \nrepresentations and warranties to             \ncounterparties in connection with a variety of\ncommercial transactions and occasionally      \nindemnifies them against potential losses     \ncaused by the breach of those representations \nand warranties. The firm may also provide     \nindemnifications protecting against changes in\nor adverse application of certain U.S. tax    \nlaws in connection with ordinary-course       \ntransactions, such as securities issuances,   \nborrowings or derivatives.In addition, the    \nfirm may provide indemnifications to some     \ncounterparties to protect them in the event   \nadditional taxes are owed or payments are     \nwithheld, due either to a change in or an     \nadverse application of certain non-U.S.tax    \nlaws. These indemnifications generally are    \nstandard contractual terms and are entered    \ninto in the ordinary course of business.      \nGenerally, there are no stated or notional    \namounts included in these indemnifications,   \nand the contingencies triggering the          \nobligation to indemnify are not expected to   \noccur. The firm is unable to develop an       \nestimate of the maximum payout under these    \nguarantees and indemnifications. However,     \nmanagement believes that it is unlikely the   \nfirm will have to make any material payments  \nunder these arrangements, and no material     \nliabilities related to these arrangements have\nbeen recognized in the consolidated balance   \nsheets as of both September 2021 and December \n2020. Guarantees of Subsidiaries. Group Inc.  \nis the entity that fully and unconditionally  \nguarantees the securities issued by GS Finance\nCorp., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of   \nthe firm. Group Inc. has guaranteed the       \npayment obligations of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n(GS&Co.), GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Paris \nInc. et Cie, subject to certain exceptions. In\naddition, Group Inc. has provided guarantees  \nto Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and      \nGoldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) related to\nagreements that each entity has entered into  \nwith certain of its counterparties.           \nFurthermore, Group Inc. provided a guarantee  \nto GS Bank USA in 2020 related to securities  \nthat GS Bank USA acquired from certain        \naffiliated funds of Group Inc. and loans and  \nlending commitments that GS Bank USA acquired \nfrom certain subsidiaries of Group Inc. As of \nSeptember 2021, none of the securities        \nacquired from the affiliated funds were       \noutstanding. Group Inc. guarantees many of the\nobligations of its other consolidated         \nsubsidiaries on a transaction-by-             \ntransactionbasis, as negotiated with          \ncounterparties. Group Inc. is unable to       \ndevelop an estimate of the maximum payout     \nunder its subsidiary guarantees. However,     \nbecause these obligations are also obligations\nof consolidated subsidiaries, Group Inc.\u2019s    \nliabilities as guarantor are not separately   \ndisclosed. Note 19. Shareholders\u2019 Equity      \nCommon Equity As of both September 2021 and   \nDecember 2020, the firm had 4.00billion       \nauthorized shares of common stock and         \n200million authorized shares of nonvoting     \ncommon stock, each with a par value of $      \n0.01per share. The firm\u2019s share repurchase    \nprogram is intended to help maintain the      \nappropriate level of common equity.

For\nrisk management\npurposes, a 95 % one-\nday VaR is used,\nwhereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements,\na 99 % 10-day VaR is\nused to determine\nMarket RWAs and a 99 %\none-day VaR is used to\ndetermine regulatory\nVaR exceptions. In\naddition, the daily\nnet revenues used to\ndetermine risk\nmanagement VaR\nexceptions (i.e.,\ncomparing the daily\nnet revenues to the\nVaR measure calculated\nas of the end of the\nprior business day)\ninclude intraday\nactivity, whereas the\nCapital Framework\nrequires that intraday\nactivity be excluded\nfrom daily net\nrevenues when\ncalculating regulatory\nVaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity\nincludes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are\nmore likely than not\nto be positive by\ntheir nature. As a\nresult, there may be\ndifferences in the\nnumber of VaR\nexceptions and the\namount of daily net\nrevenues calculated\nfor regulatory VaR\ncompared to the\namounts calculated for\nrisk management VaR.\n\nThe firm\u2019s positional\nlosses observed on a\nsingle day did not\nexceed its 99 % one-\nday regulatory VaR\nduring the nine months\nended September\u00a02021\nand exceeded its 99 %\none-day regulatory VaR\non six occasions\nduring 2020 (all of\nwhich occurred during\nMarch 2020 and, as\npermitted by the FRB,\ndid not have any\nimpact on the firm\u2019s\nVaR multiplier used to\ncalculate Market\nRWAs);\n                                              \n       Stressed VaR is the potential loss in  \n       value of trading assets and            \n       liabilities, as well as certain        \n  \u2022    investments, loans, and other          \n       financial assets and liabilities       \n       accounted for at fair value, during a  \n       period of significant market stress;

Standardized\nMarket RWAs as of\nSeptember 2021\nincreased by $\n12.58billion compared\nwith December 2020,\nprimarily reflecting\nan increase in\nstressed VaR\n(principally due to\nincreased exposures to\ninterest rates) and an\nincrease in specific\nrisk (principally due\nto increased exposures\nto securitized\nproducts).\nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of September 2021     \nincreased by $ 46.98billion compared with     \nDecember 2020, primarily reflecting an        \nincrease in commitments, guarantees and loans \n(principally due to increased lending         \nactivity), an increase in other credit RWAs   \n(principally due to increased receivables     \nexposures) and an increase in equity          \ninvestments (principally due to increased     \nexposures as a result of gains, partially     \noffset by sales). Advanced Market RWAs as of  \nSeptember 2021 increased by $ 12.58billion    \ncompared with December 2020, primarily        \nreflecting an increase in stressed VaR        \n(principally due to increased exposures to    \ninterest rates) and an increase in specific   \nrisk (principally due to increased exposures  \nto securitized products). Year Ended December \n2020. Standardized Credit RWAs as of December \n2020 decreased by $ 13.55billion compared with\nDecember 2019, primarily reflecting a decrease\nin equity investments (principally due to the \nsale of certain equity positions) and a       \ndecrease in other (principally due to         \ndecreased receivables as a result of changes  \nin risk measurements). These decreases were   \npartially offset by an increase in securities \nfinancing transactions (principally due to    \nincreased funding exposures). Standardized    \nMarket RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $\n4.14billion compared with December 2019,      \nprimarily reflecting an increase in regulatory\nVaR (principally due to increased market      \nvolatility) and an increase in incremental    \nrisk (principally due to increased exposures  \nin equities held for market-making purposes). \nThese increases were partially offset by a    \ndecrease in specific risk (principally due to \nchanges in risk measurements on certain       \nexposures). Advanced Credit RWAs as of        \nDecember 2020 increased by $ 51.63billion     \ncompared with December 2019, primarily        \nreflecting an increase in derivatives         \n(principally due to the impact of higher      \nlevels of volatility and counterparty credit  \nrisk) and an increase in commitments,         \nguarantees and loans (principally due to      \nincreased lending activity). These increases  \nwere partially offset by a decrease in equity \ninvestments (principally due to the sale of   \ncertain equity positions). Advanced Market    \nRWAs as of December 2020 increased by $       \n4.34billion compared with December 2019,      \nprimarily reflecting an increase in regulatory\nVaR (principally due to increased market      \nvolatility) and an increase in incremental    \nrisk (principally due to increased exposures  \nin equities held for market-making purposes). \nThese increases were partially offset by a    \ndecrease in specific risk (principally due to \nchanges in risk measurements on certain       \nexposures). Advanced Operational RWAs as of   \nDecember 2020 increased by $ 9.13billion      \ncompared with December 2019. The vast majority\nof this increase was associated with          \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings.        \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form       78  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

GSIB is   \nregulated by the Prudential Regulation        \nAuthority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct     \nAuthority (FCA), and GSBE is directly         \nsupervised by the European Central Bank and by\nBaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank in the context  \nof the E.U. Single Supervisory Mechanism. As  \nof both September 2021 and December 2020, GSIB\nand GSBE were in compliance with their        \nregulatory capital requirements. Other. The   \ndeposits of GS Bank USA are insured by the    \nFDIC to the extent provided by law. The FRB   \nrequires that GS Bank USA maintain cash       \nreserves with the Federal Reserve. As of both \nSeptember 2021 and December 2020, the reserve \nrequirement ratio was zero percent. The amount\ndeposited by GS Bank USA at the Federal       \nReserve was $ 100.93billion as of September   \n2021 and $ 52.71billion as of December 2020.  \nRestrictions on Payments Group Inc. may be    \nlimited in its ability to access capital held \nat certain subsidiaries as a result of        \nregulatory, tax or other constraints. These   \nlimitations include provisions of applicable  \nlaw and regulations and other regulatory      \nrestrictions that limit the ability of those  \nsubsidiaries to declare and pay dividends     \nwithout prior regulatory approval. For        \nexample, the amount of dividends that may be  \npaid by GS Bank USA are limited to the lesser \nof the amounts calculated under a recent      \nearnings test and an undivided profits test.  \nAs a result of dividends paid in connection   \nwith the acquisition of GSBE in July 2021, GS \nBank USA cannot currently declare any         \nadditional dividends without prior regulatory \napproval. In addition, subsidiaries not       \nsubject to separate regulatory capital        \nrequirements may hold capital to satisfy local\ntax and legal guidelines, rating agency       \nrequirements (for entities with assigned      \ncredit ratings) or internal policies,         \nincluding policies concerning the minimum     \namount of capital a subsidiary should hold    \nbased on its underlying level of risk. Group  \nInc.\u2019s equity investment in subsidiaries was $\n114.93billion as of September 2021 and $      \n103.80billion as of December 2020, of which   \nGroup Inc. was required to maintain $         \n83.57billion as of September 2021 and $       \n63.68billion as of December 2020, of minimum  \nequity capital in its regulated subsidiaries  \nin order to satisfy the regulatory            \nrequirements of such subsidiaries. Group      \nInc.\u2019s capital invested in certain            \nnon-U.S.subsidiaries is exposed to foreign    \nexchange risk, substantially all of which is  \nmanaged through a combination of derivatives  \nand non-U.S.denominated debt.

Compensation and benefits  \nexpenses in the firm\u2019s segments reflect, among\nother factors, the overall performance of the \nfirm, as well as the performance of individual\nbusinesses. Consequently, pre-taxmargins in   \none segment of the firm\u2019s business may be     \nsignificantly affected by the performance of  \nthe firm\u2019s other business segments. The firm  \nallocates assets (including allocations of    \nglobal core liquid assets and cash, secured   \nclient financing and other assets), revenues  \nand expenses among the four business segments.\nDue to the integrated nature of these         \nsegments, estimates and judgments are made in \nallocating certain assets, revenues and       \nexpenses. The allocation process is based on  \nthe manner in which management currently views\nthe performance of the segments. The          \nallocation of common shareholders\u2019 equity and \npreferred stock dividends to each segment is  \nbased on the estimated amount of equity       \nrequired to support the activities of the     \nsegment under relevant regulatory capital     \nrequirements. Net earnings for each segment is\ncalculated by applying the firmwide tax rate  \nto each segment\u2019s pre-taxearnings. Management \nbelieves that this allocation provides a      \nreasonable representation of each segment\u2019s   \ncontribution to consolidated net earnings to  \ncommon, return on average common equity and   \ntotal assets. Transactions between segments   \nare based on specific criteria or approximate \nthird-party rates.                            \n                                              \n  83    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These\nactivities expose the\nfirm to many different\nindustries and\ncounterparties, and\nmay also subject the\nfirm to a\nconcentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular central\nbank, counterparty,\nborrower or issuer,\nincluding sovereign\nissuers, or to a\nparticular clearing\nhouse or exchange. The\nfirm seeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by\nactively monitoring\nexposures and\nobtaining collateral\nfrom counterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm\nconsiders when\ndetermining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts. Netting and\ncollateral agreements\npermit the firm to\noffset receivables and\npayables with such\ncounterparties and/or\nenable the firm to\nobtain collateral on\nan upfront or\ncontingent basis.\nThe table below\npresents the credit\nconcentrations\nincluded in trading\ncash instruments and\ninvestments.\n                                              \n                          As of               \n  $ in\u00a0           September2021     December  \n  millions                              2020  \n  U.S.                                        \n  government           $147,262     $187,009  \n  and agency                                  \n  obligations                                 \n  Percentage                                  \n  of total                10.2%        16.1%  \n  assets                                      \n  Non-U.S.gov\u2026                                \n  and agency            $58,520    $\u00a0\u00a059,580  \n  obligations                                 \n  Percentage                                  \n  of total                 4.1%         5.1%  \n  assets                                      \n                                              \nIn addition, the firm\nhad $ 171.94 billion\nas of September\u00a02021\nand $ 116.63 billion\nas of December\u00a02020 of\ncash deposits held at\ncentral banks\n(included in cash and\ncash equivalents), of\nwhich $ 100.93 billion\nas of September\u00a02021\nand $ 52.71 billion as\nof December\u00a02020 was\nheld at the Federal\nReserve.\nAs of both\nSeptember\u00a02021 and\nDecember\u00a02020, the\nfirm did not have\ncredit exposure to any\nother counterparty\nthat exceeded 2 % of\ntotal assets.\nCollateral obtained by\nthe firm related to\nderivative assets is\nprincipally cash and is\nheld by the firm or a\nthird-party custodian.\nCollateral obtained by\nthe firm related to\nresale agreements and\nsecurities borrowed\ntransactions is\nprimarily U.S.\ngovernment and agency\nobligations and\nnon-U.S. government and\nagency obligations.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) With respect to matters described \nbelow for which management has been able to   \nestimate a range of reasonably possible loss  \nwhere (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have \nclaimed an amount of money damages, (ii) the  \nfirm is being, or threatened to be, sued by   \npurchasers in a securities offering and is not\nbeing indemnified by a party that the firm    \nbelieves will pay the full amount of any      \njudgment, or (iii) the purchasers are         \ndemanding that the firm repurchase securities,\nmanagement has estimated the upper end of the \nrange of reasonably possible loss based on (a)\nin the case of (i), the amount of money       \ndamages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the \ndifference between the initial sales price of \nthe securities that the firm sold in such     \noffering and the estimated lowest subsequent  \nprice of such securities prior to the action  \nbeing commenced and (c) in the case of (iii), \nthe price that purchasers paid for the        \nsecurities less the estimated value, if any,  \nas of September 2021 of the relevant          \nsecurities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and    \n(iii), taking into account any other factors  \nbelieved to be relevant to the particular     \nmatter or matters of that type. As of the date\nhereof, the firm has estimated the upper end  \nof the range of reasonably possible aggregate \nloss for such matters and for any other       \nmatters described below where management has  \nbeen able to estimate a range of reasonably   \npossible aggregate loss to be approximately $ \n1.8billion in excess of the aggregate reserves\nfor such matters. Management is generally     \nunable to estimate a range of reasonably      \npossible loss for matters other than those    \nincluded in the estimate above, including     \nwhere (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have \nnot claimed an amount of money damages, except\nin those instances where management can       \notherwise determine an appropriate amount,    \n(ii) matters are in early stages, (iii)       \nmatters relate to regulatory investigations or\nreviews, except in those instances where      \nmanagement can otherwise determine an         \nappropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty \nas to the likelihood of a class being         \ncertified or the ultimate size of the class,  \n(v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of \npending appeals or motions, (vi) there are    \nsignificant factual issues to be resolved,    \nand/or (vii) there are novel legal issues     \npresented. For example, the firm\u2019s potential  \nliabilities with respect to the investigations\nand reviews described below in \u201cRegulatory    \nInvestigations and Reviews and Related        \nLitigation\u201d generally are not included in     \nmanagement\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible  \nloss. However, management does not believe,   \nbased on currently available information, that\nthe outcomes of such other matters will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the firm\u2019s         \nfinancial condition, though the outcomes could\nbe material to the firm\u2019s operating results   \nfor any particular period, depending, in part,\nupon the operating results for such period.   \nSee Note 18 for further information about     \nmortgage-related contingencies. 1MDB-Related  \nMatters Between 2012 and 2013, subsidiaries of\nthe firm acted as arrangers or purchasers of  \napproximately $ 6.5billion of debt securities \nof 1MDB. On November 1, 2018, the U.S.        \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a        \ncriminal information and guilty plea by Tim   \nLeissner, a former participating managing     \ndirector of the firm, and an indictment       \nagainst Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing       \ndirector of the firm. On August 28, 2018,     \nLeissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S.   \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork of conspiring to launder money and to    \nviolate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices    \nAct\u2019s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal        \naccounting controls provisions. Ng was charged\nwith conspiring to launder money and to       \nviolate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery and internal  \naccounting controls provisions. On May 6,     \n2019, Ng pleaded not guilty to the DOJ\u2019s      \ncriminal charges. On August 18, 2020, the firm\nannounced that it entered into a settlement   \nagreement with the Government of Malaysia to  \nresolve the criminal and regulatory           \nproceedings in Malaysia involving the firm,   \nwhich includes a guarantee that the Government\nof Malaysia receives at least $ 1.4billion in \nassets and proceeds from assets seized by     \ngovernmental authorities around the world     \nrelated to 1MDB. On October 22, 2020, the firm\nannounced that it reached settlements of      \ngovernmental and regulatory investigations    \nrelating to 1MDB with the DOJ, the SEC, the   \nFRB, the NYDFS, the FCA, the PRA, the         \nSingapore Attorney General\u2019s Chambers, the    \nSingapore Commercial Affairs Department, the  \nMonetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong  \nKong Securities and Futures Commission. Group \nInc. entered into a three-year deferred       \nprosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a\ncharge against the firm, one count of         \nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and \nwill later be dismissed if the firm abides by \nthe terms of the agreement. In addition, GS   \nMalaysia pleaded guilty to one count of       \nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was       \nsentenced on June 9, 2021. In May 2021, the   \nU.S. Department of Labor granted the firm a   \nfive-year exemption to maintain its status as \na qualified professional asset manager (QPAM).\nThe firm has received multiple demands,       \nbeginning in November 2018, from alleged      \nshareholders under Section 220 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law for books and records \nrelating to, among other things, the firm\u2019s   \ninvolvement with 1MDB and the firm\u2019s          \ncompliance procedures. On December 13, 2019,  \nan alleged shareholder filed a lawsuit in the \nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware    \nseeking books and records relating to, among  \nother things, the firm\u2019s involvement with 1MDB\nand the firm\u2019s compliance procedures.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) On February 19, 2019, a purported \nshareholder derivative action relating to 1MDB\nwas filed in the U.S. District Court for the  \nSouthern District of New York against Group   \nInc. and the directors at the time and a      \nformer chairman and chief executive officer of\nthe firm. The second amended complaint filed  \non November 13, 2020, alleges breaches of     \nfiduciary duties, including in connection with\nalleged insider trading by certain current and\nformer directors, unjust enrichment and       \nviolations of the anti-fraud provisions of the\nExchange Act, including in connection with    \nGroup Inc.\u2019s common stock repurchases and     \nsolicitation of proxies, and seeks unspecified\ndamages, disgorgement and injunctive relief.  \nDefendants moved to dismiss this action on    \nJanuary 15, 2021. Beginning in March 2019, the\nfirm has also received demands from three     \nshareholders to investigate and pursue claims \nagainst certain current and former directors  \nand executive officers based on their         \noversight and public disclosures regarding    \n1MDB and related internal controls. In June   \n2019, the Board appointed a Special Committee \nto consider the demands and, in January 2021, \nthe Board voted to reject them. In June 2021, \nthe firm reached a settlement with the three  \nshareholders. Following the Board\u2019s decision  \nto reject the initial three demands, the firm \nreceived two additional demands from alleged  \nshareholders (one of which is the alleged     \nshareholder that filed the December 2019 books\nand records action in Delaware Chancery Court)\nto investigate and pursue claims related to   \n1MDB (and, for one of the demands, other      \nmatters) against other parties, including     \ncertain current and former directors and      \nexecutive officers of the firm. On December   \n20, 2018, a putative securities class action  \nlawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court  \nfor the Southern District of New York against \nGroup Inc. and certain former officers of the \nfirm alleging violations of the anti-fraud    \nprovisions of the Exchange Act with respect to\nGroup Inc.\u2019s disclosures and public statements\nconcerning 1MDB and seeking unspecified       \ndamages. The plaintiffs filed the second      \namended complaint on October 28, 2019. On June\n28, 2021, the court dismissed the claims      \nagainst one of the individual defendants but  \ndenied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss with \nrespect to the firm and the remaining         \nindividual defendants. Mortgage-Related       \nMatters Beginning in April 2010, a number of  \npurported securities law class actions were   \nfiled in the U.S. District Court for the      \nSouthern District of New York challenging the \nadequacy of Group Inc.\u2019s public disclosure of,\namong other things, the firm\u2019s activities in  \nthe collateralized debt obligation market, and\nthe firm\u2019s conflict of interest management.   \nThe consolidated amended complaint filed on   \nJuly 25, 2011, which named as defendants Group\nInc. and certain current and former officers  \nand employees of Group Inc. and its           \naffiliates, generally alleges violations of   \nSections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act  \nand seeks monetary damages. The defendants    \nhave moved for summary judgment. On April 7,  \n2020, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals     \naffirmed the district court\u2019s August 14, 2018 \ngrant of class certification. On June 21,     \n2021, the United States Supreme Court vacated \nthe judgment of the Second Circuit and        \nremanded the case for further proceedings, and\non August 26, 2021, the Second Circuit vacated\nthe district court\u2019s grant of class           \ncertification and remanded the case for       \nfurther proceedings. Complaints were filed in \nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern      \nDistrict of New York on July 25, 2019 and May \n29, 2020 against Goldman Sachs Mortgage       \nCompany and GS Mortgage Securities Corp. by   \nU.S. Bank National Association, as trustee for\ntwo residential mortgage-backed securitization\ntrusts that issued $ 1.7billion of securities.\nThe complaints generally allege that mortgage \nloans in the trusts failed to conform to      \napplicable representations and warranties and \nseek specific performance or, alternatively,  \ncompensatory damages and other relief. On     \nNovember 23, 2020, the court granted in part  \nand denied in part defendants\u2019 motion to      \ndismiss the complaint in the first action and \ndenied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the      \ncomplaint in the second action. On January 14,\n2021, amended complaints were filed in both   \nactions. Currencies-Related Litigation GS&Co. \nand Group Inc. are among the defendants named \nin an action filed in the U.S. District Court \nfor the Southern District of New York on      \nNovember 7, 2018, and GSI, GSIB, Goldman Sachs\nGroup UK Limited and GS Bank USA are among the\ndefendants in an action filed in the High     \nCourt of England and Wales on November 11,    \n2020, in each case by certain direct          \npurchasers of foreign exchange instruments    \nthat opted out of a class settlement reached  \nwith, among others, GS&Co. and Group Inc. The \nthird amended complaint in the U.S. district  \ncourt action, filed on August 3, 2020,        \ngenerally alleges that the defendants violated\nfederal antitrust law and state common law in \nconnection with an alleged conspiracy to      \nmanipulate the foreign currency exchange      \nmarkets and seeks declaratory and injunctive  \nrelief, as well as unspecified amounts of     \ncompensatory, punitive, treble and other      \ndamages. The claim in the English action is   \nfor breaches of English and E.U. competition  \nrules from 2003 to 2013 and alleges           \nmanipulation of foreign exchange rates and    \nbid/offer spreads, the exchange of            \ncommercially sensitive information among      \ndefendants and collusive trading.             \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form       88  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The complaint  \ngenerally asserts claims under federal        \nantitrust law and state common law in         \nconnection with an alleged conspiracy among   \nthe defendants to manipulateauctions for      \nforeign exchange transactions on an electronic\ntrading platform, as well as claims under the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\nAct against certain defendants other than     \nGS&Co. The complaint seeks declaratory and    \ninjunctive relief, as well as unspecified     \namounts of treble and other damages. On       \nOctober 13, 2021, the defendants filed a      \nmotion to dismiss the complaint. Banco        \nEspirito Santo S.A. and Oak Finance Beginning \nin February 2015, GSI commenced actions       \nagainst Novo Banco S.A. (Novo Banco) in the   \nEnglish Commercial Court and the Bank of      \nPortugal (BoP) in Portuguese Administrative   \nCourt in response to BoP\u2019s decisions in       \nDecember 2014, September 2015 and December    \n2015 to reverse an earlier transfer to Novo   \nBanco of an $ 835million facility agreement   \n(the Facility), structured by GSI, between Oak\nFinance Luxembourg S.A. (Oak Finance), a      \nspecial purpose vehicle formed in connection  \nwith the Facility, and Banco Espirito Santo   \nS.A. (BES) prior to the failure of BES. In    \nJuly 2018, the English Supreme Court found    \nthat the English courts did not yet have      \njurisdiction over GSI\u2019s action. In July 2018, \nthe Liquidation Committee for BES issued a    \ndecision seeking to claw back from GSI $      \n54million paid to GSI and $ 50million paid to \nOak Finance in connection with the Facility,  \nalleging that GSI acted in bad faith in       \nextending the Facility, including because GSI \nallegedly knew that BES was at risk of        \nimminent failure. In October 2018, GSI        \ncommenced an action in Lisbon Commercial Court\nchallenging the Liquidation Committee\u2019s       \ndecision and has since also issued a claim    \nagainst the Portuguese State seeking          \ncompensation for losses of approximately $    \n222million related to the failure of BES,     \ntogether with a contingent claim for the $    \n104million sought by the Liquidation          \nCommittee. Financial Advisory Services Group  \nInc. and certain of its affiliates are from   \ntime to time parties to various civil         \nlitigation and arbitration proceedings and    \nother disputes with clients and third parties \nrelating to the firm\u2019s financial advisory     \nactivities. These claims generally seek, among\nother things, compensatory damages and, in    \nsome cases, punitive damages, and in certain  \ncases allege that the firm did not            \nappropriately disclose or deal with conflicts \nof interest. Archegos-Related Matters GS&Co.  \nis among the underwriters named as defendants \nin a putative securities class action filed on\nAugust 13, 2021 in New York Supreme Court,    \nCounty of New York, relating to ViacomCBS     \nInc.\u2019s (ViacomCBS) March 2021 public offerings\nof $ 1.7billion of common stock and $         \n1.0billion of preferred stock. In addition to \nthe underwriters, the defendants include      \nViacomCBS and certain of its officers and     \ndirectors. GS&Co. underwrote 646,154shares of \ncommon stock representing an aggregate        \noffering price of approximately $ 55million   \nand 323,077shares of preferred stock          \nrepresenting an aggregate offering price of   \napproximately $ 32million.

GS&Co. is also among the primary \ndealers named as defendants in a similar      \nindividual action filed in the U.S. District  \nCourt for the Southern District of New York on\nAugust 25, 2017.

The       \nindividual action alleges a similar conspiracy\nregarding manipulation of the when-issued     \nmarket and auctions, as well as related       \nfutures and options in violation of the       \nCommodity Exchange Act. The complaints seek   \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, treble     \ndamages in an unspecified amount and          \nrestitution. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was\ngranted on March 31, 2021.

Executive Overview Three Months \nEnded September 2021 versus September 2020. We\ngenerated net earnings of $5.38 billion for   \nthe third quarter of 2021, an increase of 60% \ncompared with $3.37 billion for the third     \nquarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per common  \nshare (EPS) was $14.93 for the third quarter  \nof 2021, an increase of 66% compared with     \n$8.98 for the third quarter of 2020.          \nAnnualized return on average common           \nshareholders\u2019 equity (ROE) was 22.5% for the  \nthird quarter of 2021, compared with 16.2% for\nthe third quarter of 2020. Book value per     \ncommon share was $277.25 as of September 2021,\n4.7% higher compared with June 2021 and 17.4% \nhigher compared with December 2020. Net       \nrevenues were $13.61 billion for the third    \nquarter of 2021, 26% higher than the third    \nquarter of 2020, due to significantly higher  \nnet revenues in Investment Banking, primarily \nreflecting strong Financial advisory and      \nUnderwriting net revenues, in Global Markets, \nreflecting significantly higher net revenues  \nin Equities, and in Consumer & Wealth         \nManagement, reflecting growth in both Wealth  \nmanagement and Consumer banking net revenues. \nThese increases were partially offset by lower\nnet revenues in Asset Management, primarily   \ndriven by significantly lower net revenues in \nEquity investments. Provision for credit      \nlosses was $175 million for the third quarter \nof 2021, compared with $278 million for the   \nthird quarter of 2020. The third quarter of   \n2021 primarily reflected provisions related to\nportfolio growth (primarily in credit cards), \nwhile the third quarter of 2020 reflected     \nreserve increases from individual impairments \nrelated to wholesale loans and growth in      \ncredit card loans, partially offset by reserve\nreductions from paydowns on corporate lines of\ncredit and consumer installment loans.        \nOperating expenses were $6.59 billion for the \nthird quarter of 2021, 6% higher than the     \nthird quarter of 2020, due to higher          \ntechnology expenses, professional fees,       \ntransaction based expenses and market         \ndevelopment expenses, partially offset by     \nsignificantly lower net provisions for        \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings. Our    \nefficiency ratio (total operating expenses    \ndivided by total net revenues) for the third  \nquarter of 2021 was 48.4%, compared with 57.5%\nfor the third quarter of 2020.                \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form       98  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis During   \nthe third quarter of 2021, we returned $1.70  \nbillion of capital to common shareholders,    \nincluding $1.00 billion of common stock       \nrepurchases and $700 million of common stock  \ndividends. As of September 2021, our Common   \nEquity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 14.1%  \nunder the Standardized Capital Rules and 13.9%\nunder the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about our capital ratios. \nWe announced two strategic acquisitions during\nthe quarter, the pending acquisition of NN    \nInvestment Partners in our Asset Management   \nbusiness and the pending acquisition of       \nGreenSky, Inc. (GreenSky) in our Consumer     \nbanking business. These acquisitions          \naccelerate our strategy to drive higher, more \ndurable returns, and both acquisitions are    \nexpected to close by the end of the first     \nquarter of 2022. Nine Months Ended September  \n2021 versus September 2020. We generated net  \nearnings of $17.70 billion for the first nine \nmonths of 2021, significantly higher compared \nwith $4.95 billion for the first nine months  \nof 2020. Diluted EPS was $48.59 for the first \nnine months of 2021, significantly higher     \ncompared with $12.65 for the first nine months\nof 2020. Annualized ROE was 25.7% for the     \nfirst nine months of 2021, compared with 7.6% \nfor the first nine months of 2020. In the     \nfirst nine months of 2020, net provisions for \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings reduced \ndiluted EPS by $9.46 and annualized ROE by 5.5\npercentage points. Net revenues were $46.70   \nbillion for the first nine months of 2021, 42%\nhigher than the first nine months of 2020,    \nreflecting higher net revenues across all     \nsegments. Net revenues were significantly     \nhigher in Asset Management, primarily         \nreflecting strong Equity investments and      \nLending and debt investments net revenues, in \nInvestment Banking, primarily reflecting      \nstrong Financial advisory and Underwriting net\nrevenues, and in Consumer & Wealth Management,\nreflecting growth in both Wealth management   \nand Consumer banking net revenues. Net        \nrevenues were higher in Global Markets,       \nreflecting strong net revenues in Equities,   \npartially offset by lower net revenues in     \nFixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) \ncompared with a strong prior year period.     \nProvision for credit losses was $13 million   \nfor the first nine months of 2021, compared   \nwith $2.81 billion for the first nine months  \nof 2020. The first nine months of 2021        \nincluded provisions related to portfolio      \ngrowth (primarily in credit cards, including  \nprovisions related to the pending acquisition \nof the General Motors co-brandedcredit card   \nportfolio), largely offset by reserve         \nreductions on wholesale and consumer loans    \nreflecting continued improvement in the       \nbroader economic environment following        \nchallenging conditions in the first nine      \nmonths of 2020 as a result of the coronavirus \n(COVID-19)pandemic. Operating expenses were   \n$24.67 billion for the first nine months of   \n2021, 7% higher than the first nine months of \n2020, reflecting significantly higher         \ncompensation and benefits expenses (reflecting\nstrong performance), partially offset by lower\nnon-compensationexpenses. Within non-         \ncompensationexpenses, net provisions for      \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings were    \nsignificantly lower, partially offset by      \nhigher transaction based expenses and higher  \ntechnology expenses. Our efficiency ratio for \nthe first nine months of 2021 was 52.8%,      \ncompared with 70.3% for the first nine months \nof 2020. In the first nine months of 2020, net\nprovisions for litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings increased our efficiency ratio by \n10.3 percentage points. During the first nine \nmonths of 2021, we returned $6.29 billion of  \ncapital to common shareholders, including     \n$4.70 billion of common stock repurchases and \n$1.59 billion of common stock dividends.      \nBusiness Environment In the third quarter of  \n2021, the global economy continued its        \nrecovery amid solid fundamentals in the       \ncurrent operating environment, but there was  \nemerging uncertainty around a number of       \nfactors. On the positive side, fiscal and     \nmonetary policy remained accommodative and    \nCOVID-19vaccination rates continued to rise   \naround the world. However, inflationary       \npressures alongside supply chain complications\nand the lack of progress on U.S. economic     \npolicy, including discussions on              \ninfrastructure investment, the federal debt   \nceiling and tax increases, were concerns      \nduring the quarter. Within the context of this\nenvironment, global equity markets remained   \nstable and near all-timehighs, long-term      \ngovernment bond yields were higher and market \nvolatility was generally range-bound. Despite \nbroad improvements in the overall economy     \nsince the initial impact of the               \nCOVID-19pandemic, uncertainty remains on the  \npace of the recovery going forward, reflecting\nconcerns about virus resurgence from the Delta\nvariant and other virus mutations, vaccine    \ndistribution and vaccination rates, inflation,\nsupply chain complications, and geopolitical  \nrisks.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Critical \nAccounting Policies Fair Value Fair Value     \nHierarchy. Trading assets and liabilities,    \ncertain investments and loans, and certain    \nother financial assets and liabilities, are   \nincluded in our consolidated balance sheets at\nfair value (i.e., marked-to-market),with      \nrelated gains or losses generally recognized  \nin our consolidated statements of earnings.   \nThe use of fair value to measure financial    \ninstruments is fundamental to our risk        \nmanagement practices and is our most critical \naccounting policy. The fair value of a        \nfinancial instrument is the amount that would \nbe received to sell an asset or paid to       \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. We measure certain financial assets and \nliabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its\nnet exposure to market and/or credit risks).  \nIn determining fair value, the hierarchy under\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles \n(U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to \nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical, unrestricted assets or liabilities \n(level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to   \ninputs other than level 1 inputs that are     \nobservable, either directly or indirectly     \n(level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest        \npriority to inputs that cannot be observed in \nmarket activity (level 3 inputs). In          \nevaluating the significance of a valuation    \ninput, we consider, among other factors, a    \nportfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to that input.  \nAssets and liabilities are classified in their\nentirety based on the lowest level of input   \nthat is significant to their fair value       \nmeasurement. The fair values for substantially\nall of our financial assets and liabilities   \nare based on observable prices and inputs and \nare classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair  \nvalue hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3  \nfinancial assets and liabilities may require  \nappropriate valuation adjustments that a      \nmarket participant would require to arrive at \nfair value for factors, such as counterparty  \nand our credit quality, funding risk, transfer\nrestrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads.\nInstruments classified in level 3 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy are those which require one or\nmore significant inputs that are not          \nobservable. Level 3 financial assets          \nrepresented 1.6% as of September 2021, 1.8% as\nof June 2021 and 2.3% as of December 2020, of \nour total assets. See Notes 4 through 10 to   \nthe consolidated financial statements for     \nfurther information about level 3 financial   \nassets, including changes in level 3 financial\nassets and related fair value measurements.   \nAbsent evidence to the contrary, instruments  \nclassified in level 3 of the fair value       \nhierarchy are initially valued at transaction \nprice, which is considered to be the best     \ninitial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to \nthe transaction date, we use other            \nmethodologies to determine fair value, which  \nvary based on the type of instrument.         \nEstimating the fair value of level 3 financial\ninstruments requires judgments to be made.    \nThese judgments include:                      \n                                              \n       Determining the appropriate valuation  \n  \u2022    methodology and/or model for each      \n       type of level\u00a03 financial instrument;  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determining model inputs based on an   \n       evaluation of all relevant empirical   \n  \u2022    market data, including prices          \n       evidenced by market transactions,      \n       interest rates, credit spreads,        \n       volatilities and correlations; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determining appropriate valuation      \n  \u2022    adjustments, including those related   \n       to illiquidity or counterparty credit  \n       quality.                               \n                                              \nRegardless of the                             \nmethodology, valuation                        \ninputs and assumptions                        \nare only changed when                         \ncorroborated by                               \nsubstantive evidence.                         \nControls Over Valuation                       \nof Financial                                  \nInstruments.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Use of   \nEstimates U.S. GAAP requires us to make       \ncertain estimates and assumptions. In addition\nto the estimates we make in connection with   \nfair value measurements and the allowance for \ncredit losses on loans and lending commitments\nheld for investment and accounted for at      \namortized cost, the use of estimates and      \nassumptions is also important in determining  \ndiscretionary compensation accruals, the      \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and provisions for losses    \nthat may arise from tax audits. A substantial \nportion of our compensation and benefits      \nrepresents discretionary compensation, which  \nis finalized at year-end.We believe the most  \nappropriate way to allocate estimated year-   \nenddiscretionary compensation among interim   \nperiods is in proportion to the net revenues  \nearned in such periods. In addition to the    \nlevel of net revenues, our overall            \ncompensation expense in any given year is also\ninfluenced by, among other factors, overall   \nfinancial performance, prevailing labor       \nmarkets, business mix, the structure of our   \nshare-based compensation programs and the     \nexternal environment. Goodwill is assessed for\nimpairment annually in the fourth quarter or  \nmore frequently if events occur or            \ncircumstances change that indicate an         \nimpairment may exist. When assessing goodwill \nfor impairment, first, a qualitative          \nassessment can be made to determine whether it\nis more likely than not that the estimated    \nfair value of a reporting unit is less than   \nits estimated carrying value. If the results  \nof the qualitative assessment are not         \nconclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is   \nperformed. Alternatively, a quantitative      \ngoodwill test can be performed without        \nperforming a qualitative assessment.          \nEstimating the fair value of our reporting    \nunits requires judgment. Critical inputs to   \nthe fair value estimates include projected    \nearnings and allocated equity. There is       \ninherent uncertainty in the projected         \nearnings. The estimated carrying value of each\nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and represents the       \nestimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity\nrequired to support the activities of the     \nreporting unit under currently applicable     \nregulatory capital requirements. See Note 12  \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about goodwill. If we     \nexperience a prolonged or severe period of    \nweakness in the business environment,         \nfinancial markets, our performance or our     \ncommon stock price, or additional increases in\ncapital requirements, our goodwill could be   \nimpaired in the future. Identifiable          \nintangible assets are tested for impairment   \nwhen events or changes in circumstances       \nsuggest that an asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s      \ncarrying value may not be fully recoverable.  \nJudgment is required to evaluate whether      \nindications of potential impairment have      \noccurred, and to test intangible assets for   \nimpairment, if required. An impairment is     \nrecognized if the estimated undiscounted cash \nflows relating to the asset or asset group is \nless than the corresponding carrying value.   \nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial     \nstatements for further information about      \nidentifiable intangible assets. We also       \nestimate and provide for potential losses that\nmay arise out of litigation and regulatory    \nproceedings to the extent that such losses are\nprobable and can be reasonably estimated. In  \naddition, we estimate the upper end of the    \nrange of reasonably possible aggregate loss in\nexcess of the related reserves for litigation \nand regulatory proceedings where we believe   \nthe risk of loss is more than slight. See     \nNotes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial \nstatements for information about certain      \njudicial, litigation and regulatory           \nproceedings. Significant judgment is required \nin making these estimates and our final       \nliabilities may ultimately be materially      \ndifferent. Our total estimated liability in   \nrespect of litigation and regulatory          \nproceedings is determined on a case-by-       \ncasebasis and represents an estimate of       \nprobable losses after considering, among other\nfactors, the progress of each case, proceeding\nor investigation, our experience and the      \nexperience of others in similar cases,        \nproceedings or investigations, and the        \nopinions and views of legal counsel. In       \naccounting for income taxes, we recognize tax \npositions in the financial statements only    \nwhen it is more likely than not that the      \nposition will be sustained on examination by  \nthe relevant taxing authority based on the    \ntechnical merits of the position.

During the third quarter of 2021,\ncontinued economic recovery and continued     \nmonetary and fiscal support from central banks\nand governments globally, along with solid    \nfundamentals in the current operating         \nenvironment, provided a stable backdrop for   \nour business activities. These factors        \ncontributed to stable equity markets, strong  \ninvestment banking activity levels, and solid \nmarket-making activity levels. If optimism    \nabout the economic outlook declines or the    \nongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the \nCOVID-19pandemic are ineffective (including   \ndue to new variants or complications with     \nvaccine distribution), it may lead to a       \ndecline in global equity markets, a decline in\ninvestment banking activity levels, and a     \ndecline in market-making activity levels, and \nnet revenues and the provision for credit     \nlosses would likely be negatively impacted.   \nSee \u201cSegment Assets and Operating Results \u2014   \nSegment Operating Results\u201d for information    \nabout the operating environment and material  \ntrends and uncertainties that may impact our  \nresults of operations. Three Months Ended     \nSeptember 2021 versus September 2020. Net     \nrevenues in the consolidated statements of    \nearnings were $13.61 billion for the third    \nquarter of 2021, 26% higher than the third    \nquarter of 2020, primarily reflecting         \nsignificantly higher investment banking       \nrevenues, net interest income and investment  \nmanagement revenues, and higher market making \nrevenues, partially offset by lower other     \nprincipal transactions revenues. Non-         \nInterestRevenues. Investment banking revenues \nin the consolidated statements of earnings    \nwere $3.55 billion for the third quarter of   \n2021, 83% higher than the third quarter of    \n2020, due to significantly higher revenues in \nfinancial advisory, reflecting an increase in \ncompleted mergers and acquisitions volumes, in\nequity underwriting, primarily driven by      \nprivate placements, convertible offerings and \ninitial public offerings, and in debt         \nunderwriting, reflecting an increase in       \nleveraged finance activity. Investment        \nmanagement revenues in the consolidated       \nstatements of earnings were $2.14 billion for \nthe third quarter of 2021, 27% higher than the\nthird quarter of 2020, primarily due to       \nsignificantly higher incentive fees, driven by\nharvesting, and higher management and other   \nfees, reflecting the impact of higher average \nassets under supervision (AUS), partially     \noffset by higher fee waivers on money market  \nfunds. Commissions and fees in the            \nconsolidated statements of earnings were $860 \nmillion for the third quarter of 2021, 7%     \nhigher than the third quarter of 2020,        \nprimarily reflecting an increase in our listed\ncash equity volumes in Asia, generally        \nconsistent with market volumes in the region. \nMarket making revenues in the consolidated    \nstatements of earnings were $3.93 billion for \nthe third quarter of 2021, 18% higher than the\nthird quarter of 2020, primarily due to       \nsignificantly higher net revenues in equity   \nproducts and commodities, partially offset by \nsignificantly lower net revenues in interest  \nrate products and credit products. Other      \nprincipal transactions revenues in the        \nconsolidated statements of earnings were $1.57\nbillion for the third quarter of 2021, 19%    \nlower than the third quarter of 2020,         \nprimarily reflecting significant net losses   \nfrom investments in public equities during the\nquarter compared with net gains in the third  \nquarter of 2020, partially offset by          \nsignificantly higher net gains from           \ninvestments in private equities. Net Interest \nIncome. Net interest income in the            \nconsolidated statements of earnings was $1.56 \nbillion for the third quarter of 2021, 44%    \nhigher than the third quarter of 2020,        \nreflecting a decrease in interest expense and \nan increase in interest income. The decrease  \nin interest expense primarily related to      \ndeposits and long-term borrowings, both       \nreflecting the impact of lower interest rates.\nThe increase in interest income primarily     \nrelated to loans and other interest-earning   \nassets, both reflecting the impact of higher  \naverage balances partially offset by the      \nimpact of lower interest rates on             \ncollateralized agreements.

Nine Months Ended September  \n2021 versus September 2020. Net revenues in   \nthe consolidated statements of earnings were  \n$46.70 billion for the first nine months of   \n2021, 42% higher than the first nine months of\n2020, primarily reflecting significantly      \nhigher other principal transactions net       \nrevenues, investment banking net revenues and \nnet interest income, and higher investment    \nmanagement net revenues. Non-InterestRevenues.\nInvestment banking revenues in the            \nconsolidated statements of earnings were      \n$10.56 billion for the first nine months of   \n2021, 65% higher than the first nine months of\n2020, primarily due to significantly higher   \nrevenues in financial advisory, reflecting a  \nsignificant increase in completed mergers and \nacquisitions transactions, and in equity      \nunderwriting, primarily driven by strong      \nindustry-wide initial public offering         \nactivity, as well as higher revenues in debt  \nunderwriting, reflecting elevated industry-   \nwide leveraged finance volumes. Investment    \nmanagement revenues in the consolidated       \nstatements of earnings were $5.84 billion for \nthe first nine months of 2021, 15% higher than\nthe first nine months of 2020, primarily due  \nto higher management and other fees,          \nreflecting the impact of higher average assets\nunder supervision, partially offset by higher \nfee waivers on money market funds.            \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form      104  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Three    \nMonths Ended September 2021 versus September  \n2020. Operating expenses in the consolidated  \nstatements of earnings were $6.59 billion for \nthe third quarter of 2021, 6% higher than the \nthird quarter of 2020. Our efficiency ratio   \nfor the third quarter of 2021 was 48.4%,      \ncompared with 57.5% for the third quarter of  \n2020. The increase in operating expenses      \ncompared with the third quarter of 2020 was   \ndue to higher technology expenses (included in\ncommunications and technology and depreciation\nand amortization), professional fees,         \ntransaction based expenses and market         \ndevelopment expenses. These increases were    \npartially offset by significantly lower net   \nprovisions for litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings. Compensation and benefits        \nexpenses were slightly higher. Net provisions \nfor litigation and regulatory proceedings for \nthe third quarter of 2021 were $52 million    \ncompared with $256 million for the third      \nquarter of 2020. As of September 2021,        \nheadcount increased 5% compared with June     \n2021, primarily reflecting the timing of      \ncampus hires. Nine Months Ended September 2021\nversus September 2020. Operating expenses in  \nthe consolidated statements of earnings were  \n$24.67 billion for the first nine months of   \n2021, 7% higher than the first nine months of \n2020. Our efficiency ratio for the first nine \nmonths of 2021 was 52.8%, compared with 70.3% \nfor the first nine months of 2020. In the     \nfirst nine months of 2020, net provisions for \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings         \nincreased our efficiency ratio by 10.3        \npercentage points. The increase in operating  \nexpenses compared with the first nine months  \nof 2020 reflected significantly higher        \ncompensation and benefits expenses (reflecting\nstrong performance), partially offset by lower\nnon-compensationexpenses. Within non-         \ncompensationexpenses, net provisions for      \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings were    \nsignificantly lower, partially offset by      \nhigher transaction based expenses and higher  \ntechnology expenses (included in              \ncommunications and technology and depreciation\nand amortization). Net provisions for         \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings for the \nfirst nine months of 2021 were $352 million   \ncompared with $3.40 billion for the first nine\nmonths of 2020. As of September 2021,         \nheadcount increased 6% compared with December \n2020, reflecting investments in new business  \ninitiatives and an increase in technology     \nprofessionals. Provision for Taxes The        \neffective income tax rate for the first nine  \nmonths of 2021 was 19.6%, down from the full  \nyear income tax rate of 24.2% for 2020,       \nprimarily due to a decrease in provisions for \nnon-deductiblelitigation in the first nine    \nmonths of 2021 compared with 2020. The        \nincrease compared with 18.8% for the first    \nhalf of 2021 was primarily due to a decrease  \nin the impact of tax benefits on the          \nsettlement of share-based awards and          \nremeasurement of U.K. deferred tax assets in  \nthe first nine months of 2021 compared with   \nthe first half of 2021. In March 2021, the    \nAmerican Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Rescue Plan)\nwas signed into law. The Rescue Plan is a $1.9\ntrillion stimulus package enacted to help     \naddress the economic and health impacts of the\nCOVID-19pandemic. The Rescue Plan includes a  \nrepeal of a provision under which U.S.        \naffiliated groups could elect a worldwide     \nallocation of interest expense for foreign tax\ncredit limitation purposes for one year       \nbeginning in January 2021. Additionally,      \nbeginning in 2027, the limitation on corporate\ntax deductions for compensation payable to the\nCEO, CFO and the top three highest paid       \nemployees will be expanded to include the next\nfive highest paid employees. The legislation  \nis not expected to have a material impact on  \nour 2021 annual effective tax rate. In April  \n2021, the New York State (NYS) FY 2022 budget \nwas enacted. The legislation temporarily      \nincreased the NYS corporate income tax rate   \nfrom 6.5% to 7.25% for calendar years 2021    \nthrough 2023. The legislation is not expected \nto have a material impact on our 2021 annual  \neffective tax rate. The U.K. Finance Act 2021 \nwas enacted in June 2021 and includes a six   \npercent increase in the corporate income tax  \nrate effective from April 2023. During the    \nfirst nine months of 2021, U.K. deferred tax  \nassets and liabilities were remeasured and a  \ndeferred tax benefit of approximately $100    \nmillion was recognized. In October 2021, a    \nfive percent reduction in the U.K. bank       \nsurcharge tax rate, effective from April 2023,\nwas announced in the second U.K. budget of    \n2021. The reduction to the bank surcharge is  \nexpected to be legislated as Finance Bill     \n2022. The bank surcharge is currently         \napplicable to certain of our U.K. subsidiaries\nand branches, including Goldman Sachs         \nInternational (GSI) and Goldman Sachs         \nInternational Bank (GSIB). Following Royal    \nAssent, the associated impact of any change to\nthe bank surcharge on U.K. deferred tax assets\nand liabilities could have a material impact  \non our effective tax rate, depending on the   \noperating results for the quarter during which\nthis legislation is enacted.

During the third       \nquarter of 2021, Investment Banking operated  \nin an environment characterized by strong     \nindustry-wide activity. In mergers and        \nacquisitions, industry-wide completed and     \nannounced volumes remained at high levels,    \nreflecting supportive market conditions and   \nCEO confidence. In underwriting, both         \nindustry-wide equity and debt volumes were    \nsolid, but were lower following elevated      \nlevels in the second quarter of 2021. In the  \nfuture, if market and economic conditions     \ndeteriorate, and industry-wide mergers and    \nacquisitions volumes decline, or if industry- \nwide equity and debt underwriting volumes     \ncontinue to decline, or credit spreads related\nto hedges on our relationship lending         \nportfolio tighten, net revenues in Investment \nBanking would likely be negatively impacted.  \nIn addition, a deterioration in the           \ncreditworthiness of borrowers would negatively\nimpact the provision for credit losses. Three \nMonths Ended September 2021 versus September  \n2020. Net revenues in Investment Banking were \n$3.70 billion for the third quarter of 2021,  \n88% higher than the third quarter of 2020,    \nreflecting significantly higher net revenues  \nin Financial advisory, Underwriting and       \nCorporate lending. The increase in Financial  \nadvisory net revenues reflected an increase in\ncompleted mergers and acquisitions volumes.   \nThe increase in Underwriting net revenues was \ndue to significantly higher net revenues in   \nboth Equity underwriting, primarily driven by \nprivate placements, convertible offerings and \ninitial public offerings, and Debt            \nunderwriting, reflecting an increase in       \nleveraged finance activity. The increase in   \nCorporate lending net revenues primarily      \nreflected net gains related to middle-market  \nlending activities. Provision for credit      \nlosses was $41 million for the third quarter  \nof 2021, 76% lower than the third quarter of  \n2020, primarily reflecting lower individual   \nimpairments, while the prior year period was  \npositively impacted by reserve reductions from\npaydowns on corporate lines of credit.        \nOperating expenses were $1.34 billion for the \nthird quarter of 2021, 26% higher than the    \nthird quarter of 2020, due to significantly   \nhigher compensation and benefits expenses     \n(reflecting strong performance), partially    \noffset by lower net provisions for litigation \nand regulatory proceedings. Pre-taxearnings   \nwere $2.32 billion for the third quarter of   \n2021, compared with $731 million for the third\nquarter of 2020.                              \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form      108  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

In this role, we seek to earn the\ndifference between the price at which a market\nparticipant is willing to sell an instrument  \nto us and the price at which another market   \nparticipant is willing to buy it from us, and \nvice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In       \naddition, we maintain (i) market-making       \npositions, typically for a short period of    \ntime, in response to, or in anticipation of,  \nclient demand, and (ii) positions to actively \nmanage our risk exposures that arise from     \nthese market-making activities (collectively, \ninventory). Our inventory is recorded in      \ntrading assets (long positions) or trading    \nliabilities (short positions) in our          \nconsolidated balance sheets. Our results are  \ninfluenced by a combination of interconnected \ndrivers, including (i) client activity levels \nand transactional bid/offer spreads           \n(collectively, client activity), and (ii)     \nchanges in the fair value of our inventory and\ninterest income and interest expense related  \nto the holding, hedging and funding of our    \ninventory (collectively, market-making        \ninventory changes). Due to the integrated     \nnature of our market-making activities,       \ndisaggregation of net revenues into client    \nactivity and market-making inventory changes  \nis judgmental and has inherent complexities   \nand limitations. The amount and composition of\nour net revenues vary over time as these      \ndrivers are impacted by multiple interrelated \nfactors affecting economic and market         \nconditions, including volatility and liquidity\nin the market, changes in interest rates,     \ncurrency exchange rates, credit spreads,      \nequity prices and commodity prices, investor  \nconfidence, and other macroeconomic concerns  \nand uncertainties. In general, assuming all   \nother market-making conditions remain         \nconstant, increases in client activity levels \nor bid/offer spreads tend to result in        \nincreases in net revenues, and decreases tend \nto have the opposite effect. However, changes \nin market-making conditions can materially    \nimpact client activity levels and bid/offer   \nspreads, as well as the fair value of our     \ninventory. For example, a decrease in         \nliquidity in the market could have the impact \nof (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii)  \ndecreasing investor confidence and thereby    \ndecreasing client activity levels, and (iii)  \nwidening of credit spreads on our inventory   \npositions.                                    \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form      110  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nEnvironment. During the third quarter of 2021,\nthe operating environment for Asset Management\nreflected relatively stable equity prices and \ncredit spreads compared with the second       \nquarter of 2021, amid continued economic      \nrecovery and continued monetary and fiscal    \nsupport from central banks and governments    \nglobally. If optimism about the economic      \noutlook declines or the ongoing efforts to    \nmitigate the impact of the COVID-19pandemic   \nare ineffective, it may lead to a decline in  \nasset prices, widening of credit spreads, and \ninvestors transitioning to asset classes that \ntypically generate lower fees or investors    \nwithdrawing their assets, and net revenues in \nAsset Management would likely be negatively   \nimpacted. Three Months Ended September 2021   \nversus September 2020. Net revenues in Asset  \nManagement were $2.28 billion for the third   \nquarter of 2021, 18% lower than the third     \nquarter of 2020, primarily driven by          \nsignificantly lower net revenues in Equity    \ninvestments. In addition, net revenues in     \nLending and debt investments were lower, while\nIncentive fees were higher. The decrease in   \nEquity investments net revenues reflected     \nsignificant net losses from investments in    \npublic equities during the quarter compared   \nwith net gains in the third quarter of 2020,  \npartially offset by significantly higher net  \ngains from investments in private equities,   \ndriven by company-specific events, primarily  \nsales. The decrease in Lending and debt       \ninvestments net revenues reflected lower net  \ngains from investments in debt instruments.   \nManagement and other fees were essentially    \nunchanged, primarily reflecting higher fee    \nwaivers on money market funds, offset by the  \nimpact of higher average assets under         \nsupervision. The increase in Incentive fees   \nwas due to harvesting. Provision for credit   \nlosses was $10 million for the third quarter  \nof 2021, compared with $70 million for the    \nthird quarter of 2020. Operating expenses were\n$823 million for the third quarter of 2021,   \n39% lower than the third quarter of 2020,     \nreflecting significantly lower compensation   \nand benefits expenses. Pre-taxearnings were   \n$1.45 billion for the third quarter of 2021,  \n8% higher than the third quarter of 2020. Nine\nMonths Ended September 2021 versus September  \n2020. Net revenues in Asset Management were   \n$12.03 billion for the first nine months of   \n2021, compared with $4.77 billion for the     \nfirst nine months of 2020, primarily          \nreflecting significantly higher net revenues  \nin Equity investments and Lending and debt    \ninvestments. The increase in Equity           \ninvestments net revenues reflected            \nsignificantly higher net gains from           \ninvestments in private equities, driven by    \ncompany-specific events, including sales and  \ncapital raises, and improved corporate        \nperformance versus a challenging first nine   \nmonths of 2020. This increase was partially   \noffset by significantly lower net gains from  \ninvestments in public equities. The increase  \nin Lending and debt investments net revenues  \nreflected net gains from investments in debt  \ninstruments compared with net losses in the   \nprior year period, and significantly higher   \nnet interest income. The increase in          \nManagement and other fees reflected the impact\nof higher average assets under supervision and\nhigher other fees, partially offset by higher \nfee waivers on money market funds. Incentive  \nfees were essentially unchanged. Provision for\ncredit losses was a net benefit of $2 million \nfor the first nine months of 2021, compared   \nwith net provisions of $420 million for the   \nfirst nine months of 2020, primarily due to   \nreserve reductions in the current year period \nreflecting continued improvement in the       \nbroader economic environment following        \nchallenging conditions in the first nine      \nmonths of 2020 resulting from the             \nCOVID-19pandemic. Operating expenses were     \n$4.66 billion for the first nine months of    \n2021, 20% higher than the first nine months of\n2020, primarily reflecting significantly      \nhigher compensation and benefits expenses     \n(reflecting strong performance). Pre-         \ntaxearnings were $7.37 billion for the first  \nnine months of 2021, compared with $465       \nmillion for the first nine months of 2020.    \nConsumer & Wealth Management Consumer & Wealth\nManagement helps clients achieve their        \nindividual financial goals by providing a     \nbroad range of wealth advisory and banking    \nservices, including financial planning,       \ninvestment management, deposit taking, and    \nlending.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis The FRB  \nevaluates us based, in part, on whether we    \nhave the capital necessary to continue        \noperating under the baseline and severely     \nadverse scenarios provided by the FRB and     \nthose developed internally. This evaluation   \nalso takes into account our process for       \nidentifying risk, our controls and governance \nfor capital planning, and our guidelines for  \nmaking capital planning decisions. In         \naddition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make  \ncapital distributions (i.e., dividend payments\nand repurchases or redemptions of stock,      \nsubordinated debt or other capital securities)\nand issue capital, across the range of        \nmacroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific     \nassumptions. The FRB determines the SCB       \napplicable to us based on its own annual      \nstress test. The SCB under the Standardized   \napproach is calculated as (i) the difference  \nbetween our starting and minimum projected    \nCET1 capital ratios under the supervisory     \nseverely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned\ncommon stock dividends for each of the fourth \nthrough seventh quarters of the planning      \nhorizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-   \nweighted assets (RWAs). We submitted our 2021 \nCCAR capital plan in April 2021 and published \na summary of our annual DFAST results in June \n2021. See \u201cAvailable Information.\u201d Based on   \nour 2021 CCAR submission, the FRB reduced our \nSCB from 6.6% to 6.4%, resulting in a         \nStandardized CET1 capital ratio requirement of\n13.4%, which is effective for the period from \nOctober 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022.   \nSee \u201cShare Repurchase Program\u201d for further    \ninformation about common stock repurchases and\ndividends. GS Bank USA has its own capital    \nplanning process and, starting in 2022, will  \nbe required to submit its annual stress test  \nresults to the FRB. GSI, GSIB and Goldman     \nSachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) also have their   \nown capital planning and stress testing       \nprocess, which incorporates internally        \ndesigned stress tests developed in accordance \nwith the guidelines of their respective       \nregulators. Contingency Capital Plan. As part \nof our comprehensive capital management       \npolicy, we maintain a contingency capital     \nplan. Our contingency capital plan provides a \nframework for analyzing and responding to a   \nperceived or actual capital deficiency,       \nincluding, but not limited to, identification \nof drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as\nmitigants and potential actions. It outlines  \nthe appropriate communication procedures to   \nfollow during a crisis period, including      \ninternal dissemination of information, as well\nas timely communication with external         \nstakeholders. Capital Attribution. We assess  \neach of our businesses\u2019 capital usage based on\nour internal assessment of risks, which       \nincorporates an attribution of our relevant   \nregulatory capital requirements. These        \nregulatory capital requirements are allocated \nusing our attributed equity framework, which  \ntakes into consideration our most binding     \ncapital constraints. Our most binding capital \nconstraint is based on the results of the     \nFRB\u2019s annual stress test, which includes the  \nStandardized risk-based capital and leverage  \nratios. We review and make any necessary      \nadjustments to our attributed equity framework\neach year, in January, to reflect our final   \nCCAR results from the prior year. On January  \n1, 2021, we adjusted our attributed equity    \nframework to reflect the results of our 2020  \nCCAR submission. The adjusted attributed      \nequity framework places greater emphasis on   \nactivities that generate significant stress   \nlosses and higher Standardized risk weights.  \nAs a result of this adjustment, relative to   \nthe allocation as of December 2020, the       \nallocation of attributed equity among our     \nsegments at the start of this year changed as \nfollows: attributed equity increased by       \napproximately $3.7 billion for Asset          \nManagement and approximately $0.7 billion for \nConsumer & Wealth Management, while attributed\nequity decreased by approximately $2.3 billion\nfor Global Markets and approximately $2.1     \nbillion for Investment Banking. See \u201cSegment  \nAssets and Operating Results \u2014 Segment        \nOperating Results\u201d for information about our  \naverage quarterly attributed equity by        \nsegment. Share Repurchase Program. We use our \nshare repurchase program to help maintain the \nappropriate level of common equity. The       \nrepurchase program is effected primarily      \nthrough regular open-market purchases (which  \nmay include repurchase plans designed to      \ncomply with Rule 10b5-1and accelerated share  \nrepurchases), the amounts and timing of which \nare determined primarily by our current and   \nprojected capital position and our capital    \nplan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The\namounts and timing of the repurchases may also\nbe influenced by general market conditions and\nthe prevailing price and trading volumes of   \nour common stock. In the third quarter of     \n2021, the Board of Directors of Group Inc.    \n(Board) approved an increase in our common    \nstock dividend from $1.25 to $2.00 per share. \nDuring the third quarter of 2021, we returned \na total of $1.70 billion to shareholders,     \nincluding common stock repurchases of $1.00   \nbillion and $700 million in common stock      \ndividends. Consistent with our capital        \nmanagement philosophy, we will continue       \nprioritizing deployment of capital for our    \nclients where returns are attractive and      \nreturn any excess capital to shareholders     \nthrough share repurchases and dividends.      \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form      124  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Central banks and   \nregulators in a number of major jurisdictions \n(for example, U.S., U.K., E.U., Switzerland   \nand Japan) have convened working groups to    \nfind and implement the transition to suitable \nreplacements for IBORs. In March 2021, the FCA\nand the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark   \nAuthority announced that the publication of   \nall EUR and CHF LIBOR settings along with     \ncertain JPY, GBP and USD LIBOR settings will  \ncease after December 31, 2021 and the         \npublication of the most commonly used USD     \nLIBOR settings will cease after June 30, 2023.\nThe FCA continues to consult the market on    \npublishing synthetic rates for certain GBP and\nJPY LIBOR settings for a limited time. In     \nApril 2021, the State of New York approved    \nlegislation which minimizes legal and economic\nuncertainty for contracts that are governed by\nNew York law and have no fallback provisions  \nor have fallback provisions that are based on \nLIBOR by providing a statutory framework to   \nreplace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on  \nthe Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).  \nThe U.S. federal banking agencies have also   \nissued guidance strongly encouraging banking  \norganizations to cease using USD LIBOR as a   \nreference rate in new contracts as soon as    \npracticable and in any event by December 31,  \n2021. The International Swaps and Derivatives \nAssociation (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks        \nProtocol (IBOR Protocol), which became        \neffective in January 2021, provides           \nderivatives market participants with amended  \nfallbacks for legacy and new derivatives      \ncontracts to mitigate legal or economic       \nuncertainty. Both counterparties will have to \nadhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in      \nbilateral amendments for the terms to be      \neffective for derivative contracts. ISDA      \nconfirmed that the FCA\u2019s formal announcement  \nin March 2021 fixed the spread adjustment for \nall LIBOR rates and that fallbacks will       \nautomatically occur for outstanding           \nderivatives contracts that incorporate the    \nrelevant terms. We have a program in place    \nthat focuses on achieving an orderly          \ntransition from IBORs to alternative risk-free\nreference rates for us and our clients, and   \ncontinue to make progress on our transition   \nprogram. As part of this transition, we       \ncontinue to actively engage with our          \nregulators and clients, as well as participate\nin central bank and sector working groups. The\nmajority of our LIBOR risk exposure is to USD \nLIBOR, which is primarily in connection with  \nour derivative contracts and to a lesser      \nextent our unsecured debt, preferred stock and\nloan portfolio. For non-USDLIBOR,             \nsubstantially all of our risk exposure is in  \nconnection with derivative contracts. Our     \nderivative contracts are primarily with       \ncounterparties under bilateral agreements     \nwhich adhere to the IBOR Protocol or with     \ncentral clearing counterparties which have    \nincorporated fallbacks consistent with the    \nIBOR Protocol in their rule books and have    \nannounced that they plan, and have begun, to  \nconvert all LIBOR contracts to alternative    \nrisk-free reference rates before LIBOR        \ncessation. We continue to monitor the         \npotential legislative developments as they    \nrelate to unsecured debt and preferred stock  \nand will take actions designed to facilitate  \nan orderly transition. We are also engaged    \nwith our clients in order to remediate our    \nloan agreements through bilateral amendments. \nWe have also issued debt and deposits linked  \nto SOFR and Sterling Overnight Index Average  \n(SONIA) and executed SOFR- and SONIA-based    \nderivative contracts to make markets and      \nfacilitate client activities. When            \nappropriate, we continue to execute           \ntransactions in the market to reduce our LIBOR\nexposures arising from hedges to our fixed-   \nrate debt issuances and replace them with     \nalternative risk-free reference rate          \nexposures.

Our priority has been\nto safeguard our employees and to seek to     \nensure continuity of business operations on   \nbehalf of our clients. Our business continuity\nresponse to the COVID-19pandemic is managed by\na central team, which is led by our chief     \nadministrative officer and chief medical      \nofficer, and includes senior management within\nRisk and the chief operating officers across  \nall regions and businesses. We remain focused \non facilitating the safe return of our        \nemployees to our offices, as circumstances    \npermit, and employees in a number of our      \nlocations around the world have returned to   \nthe office to varying degrees, including a    \nmajority of employees in the U.S. Given that  \nthe situation regarding COVID-19varies        \ngeographically, our approach to transitioning \nback to the office is tailored to each        \nlocation, and it evolves as the specific      \nconditions and requirements of each location  \nchange. Our systems and infrastructure have   \nbeen robust throughout the COVID-19pandemic,  \nenabling us to conduct our activities without \ndisruption. Communication throughout our      \norganization has remained active during the   \npandemic and our risk management processes    \nhave continued to operate in a rigorous and   \ndisciplined manner. We maintained high        \nliquidity levels during the third quarter of  \n2021, as our GCLA averaged $356 billion. We   \nhave continued to access our traditional      \nfunding sources in the normal course and      \nservice our debt and other obligations on a   \ntimely basis. See \u201cBalance Sheet and Funding  \nSources\u201d and \u201cRisk Management \u2014 Liquidity Risk\nManagement\u201d for further information.          \nAccounting estimates, particularly those made \nin connection with determining the allowance  \nfor credit losses and the fair value of       \ncertain level 3 assets, are sensitive to      \nassumptions regarding future economic         \nconditions. Predicting the trajectory of the  \neconomic recovery is highly judgmental given  \nthe uncertainty as to how the pandemic will   \nevolve, as it will largely depend on the      \nextent to which the Delta variant continues to\nspread, the emergence of other mutations of   \nthe virus and further progress with vaccine   \ndistribution. See Note 9 to the consolidated  \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout our allowance for credit losses and Note\n4 to the consolidated financial statements for\nfurther information about fair value          \nmeasurements. The market backdrop was         \ngenerally favorable during the third quarter  \nof 2021 and supported healthy levels of client\nactivity, although at the end of the quarter  \nanxiety over the trajectory of inflation,     \nuncertainty regarding U.S. economic policy and\nlonger-term extension of the federal debt     \nceiling intensified and volatility increased. \nWe continued to deploy our balance sheet to   \nintermediate risk and to support the needs of \nclients. We have maintained our proactive     \napproach to managing market risk levels, which\nentails ongoing review and monitoring of      \nexposures and focusing on ways to mitigate    \nrisk. As a result of the improved broader     \neconomic backdrop, credit risk in general has \nabated from the depths of the pandemic,       \nincluding the risk associated with industries \nthat were most severely impacted by lockdowns,\nsuch as hospitality and airlines. However, the\noperating environment remains unpredictable   \nand we continue to closely monitor our        \nexposures to industries that are most at risk \nto encountering financial stress due to the   \npersistence of the pandemic. See \u201cRisk        \nManagement \u2014 Market Risk Management\u201d and \u201c\u2014   \nCredit Risk Management\u201d for further           \ninformation. Economies around the world       \ncontinue to be susceptible to potential       \nadverse developments related to the pandemic, \nsuch as additional waves of infection, a      \nworsening of supply chain constraints and an  \nintensification of inflationary pressures. If \nthe future effects of the pandemic were to    \nlead to a sustained period of economic        \nweakness, our businesses would be negatively  \nimpacted. This would have a negative impact on\nfactors that are important to our operating   \nperformance, such as the level of client      \nactivity, creditworthiness of counterparties  \nand borrowers, and the amount of our AUS. We  \nwill continue to closely monitor the rollout  \nof vaccines across regions, as well as the    \nimpact of new variants of the virus, and will \ntake further actions, as necessary, in order  \nto best serve the interests of our employees, \nclients and counterparties.

Overview and        \nStructure of Risk Management Overview We      \nbelieve that effective risk management is     \ncritical to our success. Accordingly, we have \nestablished an enterprise risk management     \nframework that employs a comprehensive,       \nintegrated approach to risk management, and is\ndesigned to enable comprehensive risk         \nmanagement processes through which we         \nidentify, assess, monitor and manage the risks\nwe assume in conducting our activities. Our   \nrisk management structure is built around     \nthree core components: governance, processes  \nand people. Governance. Risk management       \ngovernance starts with the Board, which both  \ndirectly and through its committees, including\nits Risk Committee, oversees our risk         \nmanagement policies and practices implemented \nthrough the enterprise risk management        \nframework. The Board is also responsible for  \nthe annual review and approval of our risk    \nappetite statement. The risk appetite         \nstatement describes the levels and types of   \nrisk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in \norder to achieve our objectives included in   \nour strategic business plan, while remaining  \nin compliance with regulatory requirements.   \nThe Board reviews our strategic business plan \nand is ultimately responsible for overseeing  \nand providing direction about our strategy and\nrisk appetite.                                \n                                              \n  131    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form\u00a0   \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Although we have   \n  \u2022    access to various central bank         \n       funding programs, we do not assume     \n       reliance on additional sources of      \n       funding in a liquidity crisis; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n       A combination of contractual           \n       outflows, such as upcoming maturities  \n       of unsecured debt, and contingent      \n       outflows, including, but not limited   \n       to, the withdrawal of customer credit  \n       balances in our prime brokerage        \n  \u2022    business, increase in variation        \n       margin requirements due to adverse     \n       changes in the value of our            \n       exchange-traded                        \n       andOTC-clearedderivatives, and         \n       withdrawals of deposits that have no   \n       contractual maturity.                  \n                                              \nIntraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday        \nLiquidity Model measures our intraday         \nliquidity needs using a scenario analysis     \ncharacterized by the same qualitative elements\nas our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model   \nassesses the risk of increased intraday       \nliquidity requirements during a scenario where\naccess to sources of intraday liquidity may   \nbecome constrained. Long-Term Stress Testing. \nWe utilize longer-term stress tests to take a \nforward view on our liquidity position through\nprolonged stress periods in which we          \nexperience a severe liquidity stress and      \nrecover in an environment that continues to be\nchallenging. We are focused on ensuring       \nconservative asset-liability management to    \nprepare for a prolonged period of potential   \nstress, seeking to maintain a diversified     \nfunding profile with an appropriate tenor,    \ntaking into consideration the characteristics \nand liquidity profile of our assets.          \nResolution Liquidity Models. In connection    \nwith our resolution planning efforts, we have \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy \nand Positioning framework, which estimates    \nliquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a\nstressed environment. The liquidity needs are \nmeasured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow  \nassumptions and include certain additional    \ninter-affiliate exposures. We have also       \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Execution\nNeed framework, which measures the liquidity  \nneeds of our major subsidiaries to stabilize  \nand wind-down following a Group Inc.          \nbankruptcy filing in accordance with our      \npreferred resolution strategy. In addition, we\nhave established a triggers and alerts        \nframework, which is designed to provide the   \nBoard with information needed to make an      \ninformed decision on whether and when to      \ncommence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\nLimits We use liquidity risk limits at various\nlevels and across liquidity risk types to     \nmanage the size of our liquidity exposures.   \nLimits are measured relative to acceptable    \nlevels of risk given our liquidity risk       \ntolerance. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for information about the limit   \napproval process. Limits are monitored by     \nTreasury and Liquidity Risk.

Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow   \nand Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a    \nrequirement for Group Inc., as well as a      \nstandalone requirement for each of our major  \nbroker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding  \nIHC is required to provide the necessary      \nliquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary   \ncourse of business, and is also obligated to  \nprovide capital and liquidity support to major\nsubsidiaries in the event of our material     \nfinancial distress or failure. Liquidity held \ndirectly in each of our major broker-dealer   \nand bank subsidiaries is intended for use only\nby that subsidiary to meet its liquidity      \nrequirements and is assumed not to be         \navailable to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless \n(i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no\nadditional regulatory, tax or other           \nrestrictions. In addition, the Modeled        \nLiquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model\nalso incorporate a broader assessment of      \nstandalone liquidity requirements for other   \nsubsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA\ndirectly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to      \nsupport such requirements. Other Unencumbered \nAssets. In addition to our GCLA, we have a    \nsignificant amount of other unencumbered cash \nand financial instruments, including other    \ngovernment obligations, high-grade money      \nmarket securities, corporate obligations,     \nmarginable equities, loans and cash deposits  \nnot included in our GCLA. The fair value of   \nour unencumbered assets averaged $256.84      \nbillion for the three months ended September  \n2021 and $249.61 billion for the three months \nended June 2021. We do not consider these     \nassets liquid enough to be eligible for our   \nGCLA. Liquidity Regulatory Framework As a BHC,\nwe are subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage\nRatio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the\nU.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR\nrule requires organizations to maintain an    \nadequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows   \nunder an acute, short-term liquidity stress   \nscenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by \nsubsidiaries that is in excess of their       \nminimum requirement and is subject to transfer\nrestrictions.

Interest\nRate Sensitivity. Loans accounted for at      \namortized cost were $126.03 billion as of     \nSeptember 2021 and $116.04 billion as of June \n2021, substantially all of which had floating \ninterest rates. The estimated sensitivity to a\n100 basis point increase in interest rates on \nsuch loans was $880 million as of September   \n2021 and $826 million as of June 2021 of      \nadditional interest income over a twelve-month\nperiod, which does not take into account the  \npotential impact of an increase in costs to   \nfund such loans. See Note 9 to the            \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about loans accounted for at      \namortized cost.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Our      \ncredit risk management systems capture credit \nexposure to individual counterparties and on  \nan aggregate basis to counterparties and their\nsubsidiaries. These systems also provide      \nmanagement with comprehensive information     \nabout our aggregate credit risk by product,   \ninternal credit rating, industry, country and \nregion. Risk Measures We measure our credit   \nrisk based on the potential loss in the event \nof non-paymentby a counterparty using current \nand potential exposure. For derivatives and   \nsecurities financing transactions, current    \nexposure represents the amount presently owed \nto us after taking into account applicable    \nnetting and collateral arrangements, while    \npotential exposure represents our estimate of \nthe future exposure that could arise over the \nlife of a transaction based on market         \nmovements within a specified confidence level.\nPotential exposure also takes into account    \nnetting and collateral arrangements. For loans\nand lending commitments, the primary measure  \nis a function of the notional amount of the   \nposition. Stress Tests We conduct regular     \nstress tests to calculate the credit          \nexposures, including potential concentrations \nthat would result from applying shocks to     \ncounterparty credit ratings or credit risk    \nfactors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates,\nequity prices). These shocks cover a wide     \nrange of moderate and more extreme market     \nmovements, including shocks to multiple risk  \nfactors, consistent with the occurrence of a  \nsevere market or economic event. In the case  \nof sovereign default, we estimate the direct  \nimpact of the default on our sovereign credit \nexposures, changes to our credit exposures    \narising from potential market moves in        \nresponse to the default, and the impact of    \ncredit market deterioration on corporate      \nborrowers and counterparties that may result  \nfrom the sovereign default. Unlike potential  \nexposure, which is calculated within a        \nspecified confidence level, stress testing    \ndoes not generally assume a probability of    \nthese events occurring. We also perform       \nfirmwide stress tests. See \u201cOverview and      \nStructure of Risk Management\u201d for information \nabout firmwide stress tests. To supplement    \nthese regular stress tests, as described      \nabove, we also conduct tailored stress tests  \non an ad hoc basis in response to specific    \nmarket events that we deem significant. We    \nalso utilize these stress tests to estimate   \nthe indirect impact of certain hypothetical   \nevents on our country exposures, such as the  \nimpact of credit market deterioration on      \ncorporate borrowers and counterparties along  \nwith the shocks to the risk factors described \nabove. The parameters of these shocks vary    \nbased on the scenario reflected in each stress\ntest. We review estimated losses produced by  \nthe stress tests in order to understand their \nmagnitude, highlight potential loss           \nconcentrations, and assess and mitigate our   \nexposures where necessary. Limits We use      \ncredit risk limits at various levels, as well \nas underwriting standards to manage the size  \nand nature of our credit exposures. Limits for\nindustries and countries are based on our risk\nappetite and are designed to allow for regular\nmonitoring, review, escalation and management \nof credit risk concentrations. See \u201cOverview  \nand Structure of Risk Management\u201d for         \ninformation about the limit approval process. \nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring     \nthese limits, and identifying and escalating  \nto senior management and/or the appropriate   \nrisk committee, on a timely basis, instances  \nwhere limits have been exceeded. Risk         \nMitigants To reduce our credit exposures on   \nderivatives and securities financing          \ntransactions, we may enter into netting       \nagreements with counterparties that permit us \nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. We may also reduce credit risk\nwith counterparties by entering into          \nagreements that enable us to obtain collateral\nfrom them on an upfront or contingent basis   \nand/or to terminate transactions if the       \ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating falls below a    \nspecified level. We monitor the fair value of \nthe collateral to ensure that our credit      \nexposures are appropriately collateralized. We\nseek to minimize exposures where there is a   \nsignificant positive correlation between the  \ncreditworthiness of our counterparties and the\nmarket value of collateral we receive. For    \nloans and lending commitments, depending on   \nthe credit quality of the borrower and other  \ncharacteristics of the transaction, we employ \na variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk   \nmitigants include collateral provisions,      \nguarantees, covenants, structural seniority of\nthe bank loan claims and, for certain lending \ncommitments, provisions in the legal          \ndocumentation that allow us to adjust loan    \namounts, pricing, structure and other terms as\nmarket conditions change. The type and        \nstructure of risk mitigants employed can      \nsignificantly influence the degree of credit  \nrisk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into\na counterparty\u2019s financial strength or when we\nbelieve a counterparty requires support from  \nits parent, we may obtain third-party         \nguarantees of the counterparty\u2019s obligations. \nWe may also mitigate our credit risk using    \ncredit derivatives or participation           \nagreements.                                   \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02021\u00a0Form      148  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

High external funding needs and    \ninconsistent monetary policy have led to      \nsignificant depreciation of the Turkish Lira, \nprompting concerns about foreign exchange     \nreserves and economic instability. As of      \nSeptember 2021, our total credit exposure to  \nTurkey was $2.27 billion, which was to non-   \nsovereigncounterparties or borrowers. Such    \nexposure consisted of $1.38 billion related to\nOTC derivatives, $180 million related to loans\nand lending commitments and $709 million      \nrelated to secured receivables. After taking  \ninto consideration the benefit of hedges and  \nTurkish corporate and sovereign collateral,   \nand other risk mitigants provided by Turkish  \ncounterparties, our net credit exposure was   \n$338 million. In addition, our total market   \nexposure to Turkey as of September 2021 was   \n$80 million, primarily to non-sovereignissuers\nor underliers. Such exposure consisted of $199\nmillion related to debt, $(245) million       \nrelated to credit derivatives and $126 million\nrelated to equities. Liquidity pressures      \nprompted the Argentine government to default  \nand restructure local and foreign obligations \nin 2020. Economic challenges persist and the  \ncountry still needs to secure new financial   \nterms with the IMF. As of September 2021, our \ntotal credit exposure to Argentina was $124   \nmillion, which was to non-                    \nsovereigncounterparties or borrowers, and was \nprimarily related to loans and lending        \ncommitments. In addition, our total market    \nexposure to Argentina as of September 2021 was\n$91 million, primarily to sovereign issuers or\nunderliers. Such exposure consisted of $95    \nmillion related to debt, $(34) million related\nto credit derivatives and $30 million related \nto equities. The restructuring of Lebanon\u2019s   \nsovereign debt and sharp currency depreciation\nhave led to concerns about its financial and  \npolitical stability. As of September 2021, our\ntotal credit and market exposure to Lebanon   \nwas not material. Zambia\u2019s sovereign debt     \ndefault and liquidity pressures aggravated by \nthe COVID-19pandemic have led to concerns     \nabout the country\u2019s financial stability. As of\nSeptember 2021, our total credit and market   \nexposure to Zambia was not material. Venezuela\nhas delayed payments on its sovereign debt and\nis experiencing deep economic and social      \ncrises. As of September 2021, our total credit\nand market exposure to Venezuela was not      \nmaterial. We have a comprehensive framework to\nmonitor, measure and assess our country       \nexposures and to determine our risk appetite. \nWe determine the country of risk by the       \nlocation of the counterparty, issuer or       \nunderlier\u2019s assets, where they generate       \nrevenue, the country in which they are        \nheadquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim \nagainst them could be enforced, and/or the    \ngovernment whose policies affect their ability\nto repay their obligations. We monitor our    \ncredit exposure to a specific country both at \nthe individual counterparty level, as well as \nat the aggregate country level. See \u201cStress   \nTests\u201d for information about stress tests that\nare designed to estimate the direct and       \nindirect impact of events involving the above \ncountries. Industry Exposures. The sharp      \ndecline in economic activity as a result of   \nthe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a           \nsignificant impact to the gaming and lodging  \nindustry. Though the rate of recovery in      \ngaming and lodging has accelerated during     \nrecent months, the timing of full recovery to \nthe pre-pandemiclevels remains uncertain. As  \nof September 2021, our credit exposure to     \ngaming and lodging companies (including hotel \nowners and operators) related to loans and    \nlending commitments was $2.82 billion ($526   \nmillion of loans and $2.29 billion of lending \ncommitments). Such exposure included $2.21    \nbillion of exposure to non-investment-        \ngradecounterparties ($526 million related to  \nloans and $1.68 billion related to lending    \ncommitments), of which 69% was secured. In    \naddition, we extend loans that are secured by \nhotel properties. As of September 2021, our   \nexposure related to such loans and lending    \ncommitments was $1.60 billion and was to non- \ninvestment-gradecounterparties. In addition,  \nwe have exposure to our clients in the gaming \nand lodging industry arising from derivatives.\nAs of September 2021, our credit exposure     \nrelated to derivatives and receivables to     \ngaming and lodging companies was $95 million, \nwhich was to non-investment-                  \ngradecounterparties. After taking into        \nconsideration the benefit of $62 million of   \nhedges, our net credit exposure was $2.85     \nbillion. As of September 2021, our market     \nexposure related to gaming and lodging        \ncompanies was $(296) million, substantially   \nall of which was to non-investment-           \ngradeissuers or underliers.

Statements about our      \nobjectives in management of our human capital,\nincluding our diversity goals, are based on   \nour current expectations and are subject to   \nthe risk that we may not achieve these        \nobjectives and goals due to, among other      \nthings, competition in recruiting and         \nattracting diverse candidates and unsuccessful\nefforts in retaining diverse employees.       \nStatements about our plans for our people to  \nreturn to our offices are based on our current\nexpectations and that return may be delayed   \ndue to, among other factors, future events    \nthat are unpredictable, including the course  \nof the COVID-19pandemic, responses of         \ngovernmental authorities and the availability,\nuse and effectiveness of vaccines.
