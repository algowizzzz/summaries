The\nOffering is subject to pricing, which has not\nyet occurred. If the Offering is priced and\nproceeds to closing, the Company intends to\nuse the net proceeds from the sale of the\nDepositary Shares to redeem all of its\noutstanding 6.30% Non-Cumulative Preferred\nStock, Series N, $25,000 liquidation\npreference per share (the \u201cSeries N Preferred\nStock\u201d). The depositary shares, each\nrepresenting 1/1000th interest in a share of\nSeries N Preferred Stock, are currently traded\non the New York Stock Exchange under the\nsymbol GS PrN.\n\nThe pricing of the Offering, and thus whether\nany possible redemption of outstanding\npreferred stock will occur, is subject to\nmarket conditions and other considerations.\nThere is no assurance that the Offering will\nprice and close or that the Company will\ndecide to redeem the Series N Preferred Stock.\nIf the Company decides to redeem the Series N\nPreferred Stock, it intends to announce its\ndecision by press release and an appropriate\nnotice of redemption.\n\nThe Offering is described in the Company\u2019s\npreliminary prospectus supplement dated April\n19, 2021, which was filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission today.\n\nThis Current Report on Form 8-K does not\nconstitute an offer to sell the Depositary\nShares.\n                                              \n  Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking          \n  Statements                                  \n                                              \nThis Current Report on Form 8-K contains\n\u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the\nmeaning of the safe harbor provisions of the\nU.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nof 1995.
