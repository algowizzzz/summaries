The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a      \nvoting interest entity or a variable interest \nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)   \nthe total equity investment at risk is        \nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity  \nholders have the power to direct the          \nactivities of the entity that most            \nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the    \nentity and the right to receive the residual  \nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting  \ninterest entity is ownership of a majority    \nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest \nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable  \nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that    \nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a \nvoting interest entity. The firm has a        \ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when  \nthe firm has a variable interest or interests \nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct  \nthe activities of the VIE that most           \nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic       \nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb \nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive     \nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially  \nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for    \nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method \nInvestments. When the firm does not have a    \ncontrolling financial interest in an entity   \nbut can exert significant influence over the  \nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair \nvalue by electing the fair value option       \navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant        \ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns \n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstancecommon stock. In certain cases, the  \nfirm applies the equity method of accounting  \nto new investments that are strategic in      \nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s       \nprincipal business activities, when the firm  \nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or   \nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less     \nsignificant. See Note 8 for further           \ninformation about equity-method investments.  \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form        6  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investment Funds. The firm has    \nformed investment funds with third-party      \ninvestors. These funds are typically organized\nas limited partnerships or limited liability  \ncompanies for which the firm acts as general  \npartner or manager. Generally, the firm does  \nnot hold a majority of the economic interests \nin these funds. These funds are usually voting\ninterest entities and generally are not       \nconsolidated because third-party investors    \ntypically have rights to terminate the funds  \nor to remove the firm as general partner or   \nmanager. Investments in these funds are       \ngenerally measured at net asset value (NAV)   \nand are included in investments. See Notes 8, \n18 and 22 for further information about       \ninvestments in funds. Use of Estimates        \nPreparation of these consolidated financial   \nstatements requires management to make certain\nestimates and assumptions, the most important \nof which relate to fair value measurements,   \nthe allowance for credit losses on loans and  \nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,    \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and provisions for losses    \nthat may arise from tax audits. These         \nestimates and assumptions are based on the    \nbest available information but actual results \ncould be materially different. Revenue        \nRecognition Financial Assets and Liabilities  \nat Fair Value. Trading assets and liabilities \nand certain investments are recorded at fair  \nvalue either under the fair value option or in\naccordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, \nthe firm has elected to account for certain of\nits loans and other financial assets and      \nliabilities at fair value by electing the fair\nvalue option. The fair value of a financial   \ninstrument is the amount that would be        \nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer \na liability in an orderly transaction between \nmarket participants at the measurement date.  \nFinancial assets are marked to bid prices and \nfinancial liabilities are marked to offer     \nprices. Fair value measurements do not include\ntransaction costs. Fair value gains or losses \nare generally included in market making or    \nother principal transactions. See Note 4 for  \nfurther information about fair value          \nmeasurements. Revenue from Contracts with     \nClients. The firm recognizes revenue earned   \nfrom contracts with clients for services, such\nas investment banking, investment management, \nand execution and clearing (contracts with    \nclients), when the performance obligations    \nrelated to the underlying transaction are     \ncompleted. Revenues from these contracts with \nclients represent approximately 45% of total  \nnon-interestrevenues for each of the three and\nnine months ended September 2020 (including   \napproximately 90% of investment banking       \nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment     \nmanagement revenues and all commissions and   \nfees), and approximately 50% of total non-    \ninterest revenues for the three months ended  \nSeptember 2019 and approximately 45% for the  \nnine months ended September 2019 (including   \napproximately 90% of investment banking       \nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment     \nmanagement revenues and all commissions and   \nfees). See Note 25 for information about net  \nrevenues by business segment. Investment      \nBanking Advisory. Fees from financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues when   \nthe services related to the underlying        \ntransaction are completed under the terms of  \nthe assignment. Non-refundabledeposits and    \nmilestone payments in connection with         \nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized \nin revenues upon completion of the underlying \ntransaction or when the assignment is         \notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with \nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized \nwhen incurred and are included in other       \nexpenses. Client reimbursements for such      \nexpenses are included in investment banking   \nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon   \ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses      \nassociated with underwriting assignments are  \ngenerally deferred until the related revenue  \nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise  \nconcluded. Such expenses are included in other\nexpenses.                                     \n                                              \n  7    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form      \n       10-Q                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Management fees for       \nprivate equity funds are calculated as a      \npercentage of monthly invested capital or     \ncommitted capital and are received quarterly, \nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the   \nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.      \nDistribution fees paid by the firm are        \ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net     \nasset value or the committed capital. Such    \nfees are included in brokerage, clearing,     \nexchange and distribution fees. Incentive     \nFees. Incentive fees are calculated as a      \npercentage of a fund\u2019s or separately managed  \naccount\u2019s return, or excess return above a    \nspecified benchmark or other performance      \ntarget. Incentive fees are generally based on \ninvestment performance over a twelve-month    \nperiod or over the life of a fund. Fees that  \nare based on performance over a twelve-month  \nperiod are subject to adjustment prior to the \nend of the measurement period. For fees that  \nare based on investment performance over the  \nlife of the fund, future investment           \nunderperformance may require fees previously  \ndistributed to the firm to be returned to the \nfund. Incentive fees earned from a fund or    \nseparately managed account are recognized when\nit is probable that a significant reversal of \nsuch fees will not occur, which is generally  \nwhen such fees are no longer subject to       \nfluctuations in the market value of           \ninvestments held by the fund or separately    \nmanaged account. Therefore, incentive fees    \nrecognized during the period may relate to    \nperformance obligations satisfied in previous \nperiods. Commissions and Fees The firm earns  \ncommissions and fees from executing and       \nclearing client transactions on stock, options\nand futures markets, as well as over-the-     \ncounter(OTC) transactions. Commissions and    \nfees are recognized on the day the trade is   \nexecuted. The firm also provides third-party  \nresearch services to clients in connection    \nwith certain soft-dollar arrangements. Third- \nparty research costs incurred by the firm in  \nconnection with such arrangements are         \npresented net within commissions and fees.    \nRemaining Performance Obligations Remaining   \nperformance obligations are services that the \nfirm has committed to perform in the future in\nconnection with its contracts with clients.   \nThe firm\u2019s remaining performance obligations  \nare generally related to its financial        \nadvisory assignments and certain investment   \nmanagement activities. Revenues associated    \nwith remaining performance obligations        \nrelating to financial advisory assignments    \ncannot be determined until the outcome of the \ntransaction. For the firm\u2019s investment        \nmanagement activities, where fees are         \ncalculated based on the net asset value of the\nfund or separately managed account, future    \nrevenues associated with such remaining       \nperformance obligations cannot be determined  \nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in   \nthe market value of investments held by the   \nfund or separately managed account. The firm  \nis able to determine the future revenues      \nassociated with management fees calculated    \nbased on committed capital. As of September   \n2020, substantially all future net revenues   \nassociated with such remaining performance    \nobligations will be recognized through 2027.  \nAnnual revenues associated with such          \nperformance obligations average less than $   \n250million through 2027. Transfers of         \nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has  \nrelinquished control over the assets          \ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses   \nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or     \nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s        \ncontinuing involvement with transferred       \nfinancial assets are initially recognized at  \nfair value. For transfers of financial assets \nthat are not accounted for as sales, the      \nassets are generally included in trading      \nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a \ncollateralized financing, with the related    \ninterest expense recognized over the life of  \nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further      \ninformation about transfers of financial      \nassets accounted for as collateralized        \nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted \nfor as sales.                                 \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form        8  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Cash and    \ncash equivalents also included interest-      \nbearing deposits with banks of $ 141.49billion\nas of September 2020 and $ 120.98billion as of\nDecember 2019. The firm segregates cash for   \nregulatory and other purposes related to      \nclient activity. Cash and cash equivalents    \nsegregated for regulatory and other purposes  \nwere $ 22.10billion as of September 2020 and $\n22.78billion as of December 2019. In addition,\nthe firm segregates securities for regulatory \nand other purposes related to client activity.\nSee Note 11 for further information about     \nsegregated securities. Customer and Other     \nReceivables Customer and other receivables    \nincluded receivables from customers and       \ncounterparties of $ 62.56billion as of        \nSeptember 2020 and $ 50.90billion as of       \nDecember 2019, and receivables from brokers,  \ndealers and clearing organizations of $       \n48.62billion as of September 2020 and $       \n23.71billion as of December 2019. Such        \nreceivables primarily consist of customer     \nmargin loans, receivables resulting from      \nunsettled transactions and collateral posted  \nin connection with certain derivative         \ntransactions. Substantially all of these      \nreceivables are accounted for at amortized    \ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,  \nwhich generally approximates fair value. As   \nthese receivables are not accounted for at    \nfair value, they are not included in the      \nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through\n10. Had these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of   \nboth September 2020 and December 2019. See    \nNote 10 for further information about customer\nand other receivables accounted for at fair   \nvalue under the fair value option. Interest on\ncustomer and other receivables is recognized  \nover the life of the transaction and included \nin interest income. Customer and other        \nreceivables includes receivables from         \ncontracts with clients and contract assets.   \nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to \nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s    \nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n2.65billion as of September 2020 and $        \n2.27billion as of December 2019. As of both   \nSeptember 2020 and December 2019 contract     \nassets were not material. Customer and Other  \nPayables Customer and other payables included \npayables to customers and counterparties of $ \n176.41billion as of September 2020 and $      \n170.21billion as of December 2019, and        \npayables to brokers, dealers and clearing     \norganizations of $ 10.95billion as of         \nSeptember 2020 and $ 4.61billion as of        \nDecember 2019. Such payables primarily consist\nof customer credit balances related to the    \nfirm\u2019s prime brokerage activities. Customer   \nand other payables are accounted for at cost  \nplus accrued interest, which generally        \napproximates fair value. As these payables are\nnot accounted for at fair value, they are not \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 through 10. Had these payables been   \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,  \nsubstantially all would have been classified  \nin level 2 as of both September 2020 and      \nDecember 2019. Interest on customer and other \npayables is recognized over the life of the   \ntransaction and included in interest expense. \nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities To reduce   \ncredit exposures on derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter    \ninto master netting agreements or similar     \narrangements (collectively, netting           \nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a      \ncontract with a counterparty that permits net \nsettlement of multiple transactions with that \ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of  \ntermination rights by a non-defaultingparty.  \nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all \ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is \ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with     \nrespect to its derivatives and securities     \nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms  \nof the related credit support agreements or   \nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit    \nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit    \nsupport agreement grants the non-             \ndefaultingparty exercising termination rights \nthe right to liquidate the collateral and     \napply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In    \norder to assess enforceability of the firm\u2019s  \nright of setoff under netting and credit      \nsupport agreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in   \nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the        \nagreement.                                    \n                                              \n  9    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form      \n       10-Q                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Derivatives are reported on a net-\nby-counterpartybasis (i.e., the net payable or\nreceivable for derivative assets and          \nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the  \nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting \nagreement. Securities purchased under         \nagreements to resell (resale agreements) and  \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \nand loaned transactions with the same term and\ncurrency are presented on a net-by-           \ncounterpartybasis in the consolidated balance \nsheets when such transactions meet certain    \nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements. In the consolidated balance       \nsheets, derivatives are reported net of cash  \ncollateral received and posted under          \nenforceable credit support agreements, when   \ntransacted under an enforceable netting       \nagreement. In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and         \nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not       \nreported net of the related cash and          \nsecurities received or posted as collateral.  \nSee Note 11 for further information about     \ncollateral received and pledged, including    \nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See \nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about  \noffsetting assets and liabilities. Share-based\nCompensation The cost of employee services    \nreceived in exchange for a share-based award  \nis generally measured based on the grant-date \nfair value of the award. Share-based awards   \nthat do not require future service (i.e.,     \nvested awards, including awards granted to    \nretirement-eligible employees) are expensed   \nimmediately. Share-based awards that require  \nfuture service are amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recorded when \nthey occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on \noutstanding restricted stock units (RSUs) are \ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that    \nrequire future service are forfeited, the     \nrelated dividend equivalents originally       \ncharged to retained earnings are reclassified \nto compensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues  \nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of   \nshare-based awards. In certain cases,         \nprimarily related to conflicted employment (as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements), \nthe firm may cash settle share-based          \ncompensation awards accounted for as equity   \ninstruments. For these awards, whose terms    \nallow for cash settlement, additional paid-   \nincapital is adjusted to the extent of the    \ndifference between the value of the award at  \nthe time of cash settlement and the grant-date\nvalue of the award. The tax effect related to \nthe settlement of share-based awards is       \nrecorded in income tax benefit or expense.    \nForeign Currency Translation Assets and       \nliabilities denominated in non-U.S.currencies \nare translated at rates of exchange prevailing\non the date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at   \naverage rates of exchange for the period.     \nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies   \nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a  \nnon-U.S.operation, when the functional        \ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are   \nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the     \nconsolidated statements of comprehensive      \nincome. Recent Accounting Developments Leases \n(ASC 842). In February 2016, the FASB issued  \nASU No. 2016-02,\u201cLeases (Topic 842).\u201d This ASU\nrequires that, for leases longer than one     \nyear, a lessee recognize in the balance sheet \na right-of-useasset, representing the right to\nuse the underlying asset for the lease term,  \nand a lease liability, representing the       \nliability to make lease payments. It also     \nrequires that for finance leases, a lessee    \nrecognize interest expense on the lease       \nliability, separately from the amortization of\nthe right-of-useasset in the statements of    \nearnings, while for operating leases, such    \namounts should be recognized as a combined    \nexpense. It also requires that for qualifying \nsale-leaseback transactions the seller        \nrecognize any gain or loss (based on the      \nestimated fair value of the asset at the time \nof sale) when control of the asset is         \ntransferred instead of amortizing it over the \nlease period. In addition, this ASU requires  \nexpanded disclosures about the nature and     \nterms of lease agreements. The firm adopted   \nthis ASU in January 2019 under a modified     \nretrospective approach. Upon adoption, in     \naccordance with the ASU, the firm elected to  \nnot reassess the lease classification or      \ninitial direct costs of existing leases, and  \nto not reassess whether existing contracts    \ncontain a lease. In addition, the firm has    \nelected to account for each contract\u2019s lease  \nand non-leasecomponents as a single lease     \ncomponent. The impact of adoption was a gross \nup of $ 1.77billion on the firm\u2019s consolidated\nbalance sheet and an increase to retained     \nearnings of $ 12million (net of tax) as of    \nJanuary 1, 2019.                              \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form       10  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Measurement of Credit Losses on   \nFinancial Instruments (ASC 326). In June 2016,\nthe FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,\u201cFinancial    \nInstruments \u2014 Credit Losses (Topic 326) \u2014     \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial     \nInstruments.\u201d This ASU amends several aspects \nof the measurement of credit losses on certain\nfinancial instruments, including replacing the\nexisting incurred credit loss model and other \nmodels with the Current Expected Credit Losses\n(CECL) model and amending certain aspects of  \naccounting for purchased financial assets with\ndeterioration in credit quality since         \norigination. The firm adopted this ASU in     \nJanuary 2020 under a modified retrospective   \napproach. As a result of adopting this ASU,   \nthe firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses on     \nfinancial assets and commitments that are     \nmeasured at amortized cost reflects           \nmanagement\u2019s estimate of credit losses over   \nthe remaining expected life of such assets.   \nExpected credit losses for newly recognized   \nfinancial assets and commitments, as well as  \nchanges to expected credit losses during the  \nperiod, are recognized in earnings. These     \nexpected credit losses are measured based on  \nhistorical experience, current conditions and \nforecasts that affect the collectability of   \nthe reported amount. The cumulative effect of \nmeasuring the allowance under CECL as a result\nof adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020 was\nan increase in the allowance for credit losses\nof $ 848million. The increase in the allowance\nis driven by the fact that the allowance under\nCECL covers expected credit losses over the   \nfull expected life of the loan portfolios and \nalso takes into account forecasts of expected \nfuture economic conditions. In addition, in   \naccordance with the ASU, the firm elected the \nfair value option for loans that were         \npreviously accounted for as Purchased Credit  \nImpaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease  \nto the allowance for PCI loans of $           \n169million. The cumulative effect of adopting \nthis ASU was a decrease to retained earnings  \nof $ 638million (net of tax). Facilitation of \nthe Effects of Reference Rate Reform on       \nFinancial Reporting (ASC 848). In March 2020, \nthe FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04,\u201cReference    \nRate Reform \u2014 Facilitation of the Effects of  \nReference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\u201d\nThis ASU provides optional exceptions for     \napplying generally accepted accounting        \nprinciples to contracts, hedging relationships\nand other transactions affected by reference  \nrate reform. The firm adopted this ASU in     \nMarch 2020 and adoption did not have a        \nmaterial impact on the firm\u2019s consolidated    \nfinancial statements. Note 4. Fair Value      \nMeasurements The fair value of a financial    \ninstrument is the amount that would be        \nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer \na liability in an orderly transaction between \nmarket participants at the measurement date.  \nFinancial assets are marked to bid prices and \nfinancial liabilities are marked to offer     \nprices. Fair value measurements do not include\ntransaction costs. The firm measures certain  \nfinancial assets and liabilities as a         \nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to \nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active  \nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by    \nreference to prices for similar instruments,  \nquoted prices or recent transactions in less  \nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or            \nindependently sourced inputs, including, but  \nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities, \nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding  \nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference       \nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower \ncould finance a given financial instrument    \nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.  \nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for          \ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This   \nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation \ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving \nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based \non the lowest level of input that is          \nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In \nevaluating the significance of a valuation    \ninput, the firm considers, among other        \nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to   \nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as    \nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical, \nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.  \nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are       \nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values \nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial \nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain  \nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and      \nliabilities may require valuation adjustments \nthat a market participant would require to    \narrive at fair value for factors, such as     \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,   \nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments  \nare generally based on market evidence.       \n                                              \n  11    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See Notes 5  \nthrough 10 for further information about      \nsignificant unobservable inputs used to value \nlevel 3 financial instruments. Valuation      \nTechniques and Significant Inputs for Trading \nCash Instruments, Investments and Loans Level \n1. Level 1 instruments include U.S. government\nobligations, most non-U.S.government          \nobligations, certain agency obligations,      \ncertain corporate debt instruments, certain   \nmoney market instruments and actively traded  \nlisted equities. These instruments are valued \nusing quoted prices for identical unrestricted\ninstruments in active markets. The firm       \ndefines active markets for equity instruments \nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market  \ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm   \ndefines active markets for debt instruments   \nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity. \nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain  \nnon-U.S.government obligations, most agency   \nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and   \nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,  \nmost state and municipal obligations, most    \nmoney market instruments, most other debt     \nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed \nequities, certain private equities,           \ncommodities and certain lending commitments.  \nValuations of level 2 instruments can be      \nverified to quoted prices, recent trading     \nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative    \npricing sources with reasonable levels of     \nprice transparency. Consideration is given to \nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor firm) and the relationship of recent market\nactivity to the prices provided from          \nalternative pricing sources. Valuation        \nadjustments are typically made to level 2     \ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject  \nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair   \nvalue.

Credit default   \n       swaps that reference indices, large    \n       corporates and major sovereigns        \n       generally exhibit the most price       \n       transparency.

For\nderivatives that trade\nin liquid markets,\nmodel selection does\nnot involve significant\nmanagement judgment\nbecause outputs of\nmodels can be\ncalibrated to market-\nclearing levels.\n\nValuation models\nrequire a variety of\ninputs, such as\ncontractual terms,\nmarket prices, yield\ncurves, discount rates\n(including those\nderived from interest\nrates on collateral\nreceived and posted as\nspecified in credit\nsupport agreements for\ncollateralized\nderivatives), credit\ncurves, measures of\nvolatility, prepayment\nrates, loss severity\nrates and correlations\nof such inputs.\nSignificant inputs to\nthe valuations of level\n2 derivatives can be\nverified to market\ntransactions, broker or\ndealer quotations or\nother alternative\npricing sources with\nreasonable levels of\nprice transparency.\nConsideration is given\nto the nature of the\nquotations (e.g.,\nindicative or firm) and\nthe relationship of\nrecent market activity\nto the prices provided\nfrom alternative\npricing sources.\n\nLevel 3. Level 3\nderivatives are valued\nusing models which\nutilize observable\nlevel 1 and/or level 2\ninputs, as well as\nunobservable level 3\ninputs.

In addition,    \n  \u2022    the valuation of certain structured    \n       trades requires the use of level\u00a03     \n       correlation inputs, such as the        \n       correlation of the price performance   \n       of two or more individual stocks or    \n       the correlation of the price           \n       performance for a basket of stocks to  \n       another asset class, such as           \n       commodities.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form       14  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Subsequent to the initial         \nvaluation of a level 3 derivative, the firm   \nupdates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to     \nreflect observable market changes and any     \nresulting gains and losses are classified in  \nlevel 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when      \ncorroborated by evidence, such as similar     \nmarket transactions, third-party pricing      \nservices and/or broker or dealer quotations or\nother empirical market data. In circumstances \nwhere the firm cannot verify the model value  \nby reference to market transactions, it is    \npossible that a different valuation model     \ncould produce a materially different estimate \nof fair value. See Note 7 for further         \ninformation about significant unobservable    \ninputs used in the valuation of level 3       \nderivatives. Valuation Adjustments. Valuation \nadjustments are integral to determining the   \nfair value of derivative portfolios and are   \nused to adjust the mid-marketvaluations       \nproduced by derivative pricing models to the  \nexit price valuation. These adjustments       \nincorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of    \nliquidity, credit valuation adjustments and   \nfunding valuation adjustments, which account  \nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in   \nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative    \nportfolios. The firm also makes funding       \nvaluation adjustments to collateralized       \nderivatives where the terms of the agreement  \ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge \ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are  \ngenerally used when calibrating valuation     \nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In     \naddition, for derivatives that include        \nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm     \nmakes model or exit price adjustments to      \naccount for the valuation uncertainty present \nin the transaction. Valuation Techniques and  \nSignificant Inputs for Other Financial        \nInstruments at Fair Value In addition to      \ntrading cash instruments, derivatives, and    \ncertain investments and loans, the firm       \naccounts for certain of its other financial   \nassets and liabilities at fair value under the\nfair value option. Such instruments include   \nrepurchase agreements and substantially all   \nresale agreements; securities borrowed and    \nloaned in Fixed Income, Currency and          \nCommodities (FICC) financing; certain customer\nand other receivables, including certain      \nmargin loans; certain time deposits, including\nstructured certificates of deposit, which are \nhybrid financial instruments; substantially   \nall other secured financings, including       \ntransfers of assets accounted for as          \nfinancings; certain unsecured short- and long-\nterm borrowings, substantially all of which   \nare hybrid financial instruments; and other   \nliabilities. These instruments are generally  \nvalued based on discounted cash flow          \ntechniques, which incorporate inputs with     \nreasonable levels of price transparency, and  \nare generally classified in level 2 because   \nthe inputs are observable. Valuation          \nadjustments may be made for liquidity and for \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality.   \nThe significant inputs used to value the      \nfirm\u2019s other financial instruments are        \ndescribed below. Resale and Repurchase        \nAgreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of    \nresale and repurchase agreements and          \nsecurities borrowed and loaned are funding    \nspreads, the amount and timing of expected    \nfuture cash flows and interest rates. Customer\nand Other Receivables. The significant inputs \nto the valuation of receivables are interest  \nrates, the amount and timing of expected      \nfuture cash flows and funding spreads.        \nDeposits. The significant inputs to the       \nvaluation of time deposits are interest rates \nand the amount and timing of future cash      \nflows. The inputs used to value the embedded  \nderivative component of hybrid financial      \ninstruments are consistent with the inputs    \nused to value the firm\u2019s other derivative     \ninstruments described above. See Note 7 for   \nfurther information about derivatives and Note\n13 for further information about deposits.    \nOther Secured Financings. The significant     \ninputs to the valuation of other secured      \nfinancings are the amount and timing of       \nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,   \nfunding spreads, the fair value of the        \ncollateral delivered by the firm (determined  \nusing the amount and timing of expected future\ncash flows, market prices, market yields and  \nrecovery assumptions) and the frequency of    \nadditional collateral calls. See Note 11 for  \nfurther information about other secured       \nfinancings. Unsecured Short- and Long-Term    \nBorrowings. The significant inputs to the     \nvaluation of unsecured short- and long-term   \nborrowings are the amount and timing of       \nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,   \nthe credit spreads of the firm and commodity  \nprices for prepaid commodity transactions. The\ninputs used to value the embedded derivative  \ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are \nconsistent with the inputs used to value the  \nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described \nabove. See Note 7 for further information     \nabout derivatives and Note 14 for further     \ninformation about borrowings. Other           \nLiabilities. The significant inputs to the    \nvaluation of other liabilities are the amount \nand timing of expected future cash flows and  \nequity volatility and correlation inputs. The \ninputs used to value the embedded derivative  \ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are \nconsistent with the inputs used to value the  \nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described \nabove.

Note 7. Derivatives and Hedging  \nActivities Derivative Activities Derivatives  \nare instruments that derive their value from  \nunderlying asset prices, indices, reference   \nrates and other inputs, or a combination of   \nthese factors. Derivatives may be traded on an\nexchange (exchange-traded) or they may be     \nprivately negotiated contracts, which are     \nusually referred to as OTC derivatives.       \nCertain of the firm\u2019s OTC derivatives are     \ncleared and settled through central clearing  \ncounterparties (OTC-cleared),while others are \nbilateral contracts between two counterparties\n(bilateral OTC).                              \nMarket Making. As a\nmarket maker, the firm\nenters into derivative\ntransactions to provide\nliquidity to clients\nand to facilitate the\ntransfer and hedging of\ntheir risks. In this\nrole, the firm\ntypically acts as\nprincipal and is\nrequired to commit\ncapital to provide\nexecution, and\nmaintains market-making\npositions in response\nto, or in anticipation\nof, client demand.\n\nRisk Management. The\nfirm also enters into\nderivatives to actively\nmanage risk exposures\nthat arise from its\nmarket-making and\ninvesting and financing\nactivities. The firm\u2019s\nholdings and exposures\nare hedged, in many\ncases, on either a\nportfolio or risk-\nspecific basis, as\nopposed to an\ninstrument-by-\ninstrumentbasis. The\noffsetting impact of\nthis economic hedging\nis reflected in the\nsame business segment\nas the related\nrevenues. In addition,\nthe firm may enter into\nderivatives designated\nas hedges under U.S.\nGAAP. These derivatives\nare used to manage\ninterest rate exposure\nof certain fixed-rate\nunsecured borrowings\nand deposits, as well\nas to manage foreign\nexchange risk of\ncertain available-for-\nsale securities and the\nnet investment in\ncertain\nnon-U.S.operations.\n\nThe firm enters into\nvarious types of\nderivatives, including:\n                                              \n       Futures and Forwards.Contracts that    \n       commit counterparties to purchase or   \n  \u2022    sell financial instruments,            \n       commodities or currencies in the       \n       future.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Swaps.Contracts that require           \n       counterparties to exchange cash        \n       flows, such as currency or interest    \n       payment streams. The amounts           \n  \u2022    exchanged are based on the specific    \n       terms of the contract with reference   \n       to specified rates, financial          \n       instruments, commodities, currencies   \n       or indices.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Options.Contracts in which the option  \n       purchaser has the right, but not the   \n       obligation, to purchase from or sell   \n  \u2022    to the option writer financial         \n       instruments, commodities or            \n       currencies within a defined time       \n       period for a specified price.          \n                                              \nDerivatives are\nreported on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for\nderivative assets and\nliabilities for a given\ncounterparty) when a\nlegal right of setoff\nexists under an\nenforceable netting\nagreement (counterparty\nnetting). Derivatives\nare accounted for at\nfair value, net of cash\ncollateral received or\nposted under\nenforceable credit\nsupport agreements\n(cash collateral\nnetting). Derivative\nassets are included in\ntrading assets and\nderivative liabilities\nare included in trading\nliabilities. Realized\nand unrealized gains\nand losses on\nderivatives not\ndesignated as hedges\nare included in market\nmaking (for derivatives\nincluded in the Global\nMarkets segment), and\nother principal\ntransactions (for\nderivatives included in\nthe remaining business\nsegments) in the\nconsolidated statements\nof earnings.

If there   \n       is no credit event, as defined in the  \n       contract, the seller of protection     \n       makes no payments to the buyer. If a   \n       credit event occurs, the seller of     \n       protection is required to make a       \n       payment to the buyer, calculated       \n       according to the terms of the          \n       contract.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit Options.In a credit option,     \n       the option writer assumes the          \n       obligation to purchase or sell a       \n       reference obligation at a specified    \n       price or credit spread. The option     \n       purchaser buys the right, but does     \n  \u2022    not assume the obligation, to sell     \n       the reference obligation to, or        \n       purchase it from, the option writer.   \n       The payments on credit options depend  \n       either on a particular credit spread   \n       or the price of the reference          \n       obligation.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form       26  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

If a credit event occurs in     \n       one of the underlying reference        \n       obligations, the protection seller     \n       pays the protection buyer. The         \n       payment is typically apro-rataportion  \n       of the transaction\u2019s total notional    \n  \u2022    amount based on the underlying         \n       defaulted reference obligation. In     \n       certain transactions, the credit risk  \n       of a basket or index is separated      \n       into various portions (tranches),      \n       each having different levels of        \n       subordination. The most junior         \n       tranches cover initial defaults and    \n       once losses exceed the notional        \n       amount of these junior tranches, any   \n       excess loss is covered by the next     \n       most senior tranche.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Total Return Swaps.A total return      \n       swap transfers the risks relating to   \n       economic performance of a reference    \n       obligation from the protection buyer   \n       to the protection seller. Typically,   \n       the protection buyer receives a        \n  \u2022    floating rate of interest and          \n       protection against any reduction in    \n       fair value of the reference            \n       obligation, and the protection seller  \n       receives the cash flows associated     \n       with the reference obligation, plus    \n       any increase in the fair value of the  \n       reference obligation.                  \n                                              \nThe firm economically\nhedges its exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a\nparticular written\ncredit derivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default.\n\nAs of September 2020,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n558.19billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n607.73billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 49.54billion.

These interest\nrate swaps hedge\nchanges in fair value\nattributable to the\ndesignated benchmark\ninterest rate (e.g.,\nLondon Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR),\nSecured Overnight\nFinancing Rate or\nOvernight Index Swap\nRate), effectively\nconverting a\nsubstantial portion of\nfixed-rate obligations\ninto floating-rate\nobligations.\nThe firm applies a\nstatistical method that\nutilizes regression\nanalysis when assessing\nthe effectiveness of\nthese hedging\nrelationships in\nachieving offsetting\nchanges in the fair\nvalues of the hedging\ninstrument and the risk\nbeing hedged (i.e.,\ninterest rate risk). An\ninterest rate swap is\nconsidered highly\neffective in offsetting\nchanges in fair value\nattributable to changes\nin the hedged risk when\nthe regression analysis\nresults in a\ncoefficient of\ndetermination of 80% or\ngreater and a slope\nbetween 80% and 125%.\n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form       28  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For qualifying\nnet investment hedges,\nall gains or losses on\nthe hedging instruments\nare included in\ncurrency translation.\n\nThe table below\npresents the\ngains/(losses) from net\ninvestment hedging.\n                                              \n         Th\u2026               Ni\u2026                \n         Mo\u2026               Mo\u2026                \n         En\u2026               En\u2026                \n         Se\u2026               Se\u2026                \n  $                                           \n  in\u00a0    20\u2026       2019    20\u2026       2019     \n  mi\u2026                                         \n  He\u2026                                         \n  Fo\u2026                                         \n  cu\u2026    $(\u2026  )    $367    $3\u2026       $351     \n  fo\u2026                                         \n  co\u2026                                         \n  Fo\u2026                 $                 $     \n  cu\u2026    $(\u2026  )      26    $(\u2026  )     (18  )  \n  de\u2026                                         \n                                              \nGains or losses on\nindividual net\ninvestments in non-U.S.\noperations are\nreclassified to\nearnings from\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss) when such\nnet investments are\nsold or substantially\nliquidated.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investments in Funds at Net Asset \nValue Per Share. Equity securities and debt   \ninstruments, at fair value include investments\nin funds that are measured at NAV of the      \ninvestment fund. The firm uses NAV to measure \nthe fair value of fund investments when (i)   \nthe fund investment does not have a readily   \ndeterminable fair value and (ii) the NAV of   \nthe investment fund is calculated in a manner \nconsistent with the measurement principles of \ninvestment company accounting, including      \nmeasurement of the investments at fair value. \nSubstantially all of the firm\u2019s investments in\nfunds at NAV consist of investments in firm-  \nsponsored private equity, credit, real estate \nand hedge funds where the firm co-investswith \nthird-party investors. Private equity funds   \nprimarily invest in a broad range of          \nindustries worldwide, including leveraged     \nbuyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments\nand distressed investments. Credit funds      \ngenerally invest in loans and other fixed     \nincome instruments and are focused on         \nproviding private high-yield capital for      \nleveraged and management buyout transactions, \nrecapitalizations, financings, refinancings,  \nacquisitions and restructurings for private   \nequity firms, private family companies and    \ncorporate issuers. Real estate funds invest   \nglobally, primarily in real estate companies, \nloan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and   \nproperty. Private equity, credit and real     \nestate funds are closed-endfunds in which the \nfirm\u2019s investments are generally not eligible \nfor redemption. Distributions will be received\nfrom these funds as the underlying assets are \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. The firm also invests in hedge  \nfunds, primarily multi-disciplinary hedge     \nfunds that employ a fundamental bottom-       \nupinvestment approach across various asset    \nclasses and strategies. The firm\u2019s investments\nin hedge funds primarily include interests    \nwhere the underlying assets are illiquid in   \nnature, and proceeds from redemptions will not\nbe received until the underlying assets are   \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. Private equity, hedge and real  \nestate funds described above are primarily    \n\u201ccovered funds\u201d as defined in the Volcker Rule\nof the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).

For example, the highest   \n       multiple for private equity            \n  \u2022    securities is appropriate for valuing  \n       a specific private equity security     \n       but may not be appropriate for         \n       valuing any other private equity       \n       security. Accordingly, the ranges of   \n       inputs do not represent uncertainty    \n       in, or possible ranges of, fair value  \n       measurements of level\u00a03 investments.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increases in yield, discount rate,     \n       capitalization rate or duration used   \n       in the valuation of level\u00a03            \n       investments would have resulted in a   \n       lower fair value measurement, while    \n       increases in recovery rate or          \n  \u2022    multiples would have resulted in a     \n       higher fair value measurement as of    \n       both September\u00a02020 and December\u00a0      \n       2019.

Loans accounted\nfor at amortized cost\n(other than credit card\nloans) are placed on\nnonaccrual status when\nit is probable that the\nfirm will not collect\nall principal and\ninterest due under the\ncontractual terms,\nregardless of the\ndelinquency status or\nif a loan is past due\nfor 90 days or more,\nunless the loan is both\nwell collateralized and\nin the process of\ncollection. At that\ntime, all accrued but\nuncollected interest is\nreversed against\ninterest income and\ninterest subsequently\ncollected is recognized\non a cash basis to the\nextent the loan balance\nis deemed collectible.\nOtherwise, all cash\nreceived is used to\nreduce the outstanding\nloan balance. A loan is\nconsidered past due\nwhen a principal or\ninterest payment has\nnot been made according\nto its contractual\nterms. Credit card\nloans are not placed on\nnonaccrual status and\naccrue interest until\nthe loan is paid in\nfull or is charged-off.\n\nIn certain\ncircumstances, the firm\nmay modify the original\nterms of a loan\nagreement by granting a\nconcession to a\nborrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty,\ntypically in the form\nof a modification of\nloan covenants, but may\nalso include\nforbearance of interest\nor principal, payment\nextensions or interest\nrate reductions. These\nmodifications, to the\nextent significant, are\nconsidered troubled\ndebt restructurings\n(TDRs). Loan\nmodifications that\nextend payment terms\nfor a period of less\nthan 90 days are\ngenerally considered\ninsignificant and\ntherefore not reported\nas TDRs.\n\nIn response to the\nglobal outbreak of the\ncoronavirus (COVID-19)\npandemic, the firm\nadopted the relief\nissued under the\nCoronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic\nSecurity (CARES) Act\nand certain\ninterpretive guidance\nissued by the U.S.\nbanking agencies that\nprovides for certain\nmodified loans that\nwould otherwise meet\nthe definition of a TDR\nto not be classified as\nsuch.

The firm adopted \nASU No. 2016-13in January 2020, which replaced\nthe incurred credit loss model for recognizing\ncredit losses with the CECL model. As a       \nresult, the firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\neffective January 2020 reflects management\u2019s  \nestimate of credit losses over the remaining  \nexpected life of such loans and also considers\nforecasts of future economic conditions. Prior\nto January 2020, the allowance for credit     \nlosses reflected probable incurred credit     \nlosses. See Note 3 for further information    \nabout the adoption of CECL. To determine the  \nallowance for credit losses, the firm         \nclassifies its loans and lending commitments  \naccounted for at amortized cost into wholesale\nand consumer portfolios. Prior to January     \n2020, the firm also had PCI loans which were  \nclassified as a separate portfolio. These     \nportfolios represent the level at which the   \nfirm has developed and documented its         \nmethodology to determine the allowance for    \ncredit losses. The allowance for credit losses\nis measured on a collective basis for loans   \nthat exhibit similar risk characteristics     \nusing a modeled approach and asset-specific   \nbasis for loans that do not share similar risk\ncharacteristics. Under CECL, the allowance for\ncredit losses takes into account the weighted \naverage of a range of forecasts of future     \neconomic conditions over the expected life of \nthe loan and lending commitments. The expected\nlife of each loan or lending commitment is    \ndetermined based on the contractual term      \nadjusted for extension options or demand      \nfeatures. The forecasts include baseline,     \nfavorable and adverse economic scenarios over \na three-year period. For loans with expected  \nlives beyond three years, the model reverts to\nhistorical loss information based on a non-   \nlinearmodeled approach. The forecasted        \neconomic scenarios consider a number of       \nfactors relevant to the wholesale and consumer\nportfolios described below.

The\nallowance for credit\nlosses on these loans\nwas $ 570million as of\nSeptember 2020 and $\n207million as of\nDecember 2019. These\nloans included $\n838million as of\nSeptember 2020 and $\n754million as of\nDecember 2019 of loans\nwhich did not require\na reserve as the loan\nwas deemed to be\nrecoverable.\n\nSee Note 18 for\nfurther information\nabout lending\ncommitments.\n\nThe following is a\ndescription of the\nmethodology used to\ncalculate the\nallowance for credit\nlosses:\nWholesale.The allowance for credit losses for \nwholesale loans and lending commitments that  \nexhibit similar risk characteristics is       \nmeasured using a modeled approach. These      \nmodels determine the probability of default   \nand loss given default based on various risk  \nfactors, including internal credit ratings,   \nindustry default and loss data, expected life,\nmacroeconomic indicators, the borrower\u2019s      \ncapacity to meet its financial obligations,   \nthe borrower\u2019s country of risk and industry,  \nloan seniority and collateral type. For       \nlending commitments, the methodology also     \nconsiders probability of drawdowns or funding.\nIn addition, for loans backed by real estate, \nrisk factors include the loan-to-valueratio,  \ndebt service ratio and home price index. The  \nmost significant inputs to the forecast model \nfor wholesale loans and lending commitments   \ninclude unemployment rates, GDP, credit       \nspreads, commercial and industrial delinquency\nrates, short- and long-term interest rates,   \nand oil prices. The allowance for loan losses \nfor wholesale loans that do not share similar \nrisk characteristics, such as nonaccrual loans\nor loans in a troubled debt restructuring, is \ncalculated using the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s    \noriginal effective rate, the observable market\nprice of the loan or the fair value of the    \ncollateral. Wholesale loans are charged-      \noffagainst the allowance for loan losses when \ndeemed to be uncollectible. Consumer. The     \nallowance for credit losses for consumer loans\nthat exhibit similar risk characteristics is  \ncalculated using a modeled approach which     \nclassifies consumer loans into pools based on \nborrower-related and exposure-related         \ncharacteristics that differentiate a pool\u2019s   \nrisk characteristics from other pools. The    \nfactors considered in determining a pool are  \ngenerally consistent with the risk            \ncharacteristics used for internal credit risk \nmeasurement and management and include key    \nmetrics, such as FICO credit scores,          \ndelinquency status, loan vintage and          \nmacroeconomic indicators. The most significant\ninputs to the forecast model for consumer     \nloans include unemployment rates and          \ndelinquency rates. The expected life of       \nrevolving credit card loans is determined by  \nmodeling expected future draws and the timing \nand amount of repayments allocated to the     \nfunded balance. The firm does not recognize an\nallowance for credit losses on credit card    \nlending commitments as they are cancellable by\nthe firm. The allowance for credit losses for \nconsumer loans that do not share similar risk \ncharacteristics, such as loans in a troubled  \ndebt restructuring, is calculated using the   \npresent value of expected future cash flows   \ndiscounted at the loan\u2019s original effective   \nrate. Installment loans are charged-offwhen   \nthey are 120 days past due. Credit card loans \nare charged-offwhen they are 180 days past    \ndue.                                          \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form       40  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Rollforward\nCommentary\n\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 2020. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses increased by $\n2.53billion during the\nnine months ended\nSeptember 2020.\n\nThe impact of CECL\nadoption for wholesale\nand consumer loans was\ndriven by the fact that\nthe allowance under\nCECL covers expected\ncredit losses over the\nfull expected life of\nthe loan portfolios and\nalso considers\nforecasts of expected\nfuture economic\nconditions. The impact\nof CECL adoption for\nPCI loans was as a\nresult of the firm\nelecting to apply the\nfair value option for\nsuch loans.\n\nThe provision for\ncredit losses for\nwholesale and consumer\nloans reflected the\ncontinued impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on\neconomic conditions,\nwhich resulted in\nhigher modeled expected\nlosses and lower\nrecoveries. The\nallowance for loan\nlosses ratio for\nwholesale loans\nincreased to 2.8 % as\nof September\u00a02020\ncompared with 1.1 % as\nof December\u00a02019, while\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses ratio for\nconsumer loans\nincreased to 16.1 % as\nof September\u00a02020\ncompared with 6.0 % as\nof December\u00a02019. The\nincrease in the\nallowance for loan\nlosses ratios reflected\nboth the impact of\nadopting the CECL\nstandard, as well as\nhigher provision for\ncredit losses.\n\nWhen modeling expected\ncredit losses, the firm\nemploys a weighted,\nmultivariate forecast,\nwhich includes\nbaseline, adverse and\nfavorable economic\nscenarios. As of\nSeptember\u00a02020, the\nforecasted economic\nscenarios were most\nheavily weighted\ntowards the baseline\nand adverse scenarios.\nThe forecast model\nincorporated\nadjustments to reflect\nthe impact of\nCOVID-19-related\nconcession programs on\ndelinquency rates and\nalso considered the\nimpact of the CARES Act\nand other economic\nsupport programs\nprovided by national\ngovernments.\nThe table below\npresents the forecasted\nrange (across the\nbaseline, adverse and\nfavorable scenarios) of\nthe U.S. unemployment\nand U.S. GDP growth\nrates used in the\nforecast model as of\nSeptember 2020.\n                                              \n  Forecast                                    \n  for the                                     \n  quarter        U.S.\u00a0          Growth/(Dec\u2026  \n  ended:         Unemployme\u2026    U.S. GDP      \n  December       7.0%\u00a0          (0.3)%\u00a0to\u00a0    \n  2020           to11.8%        (8.2)%        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  June 2021      5.5%           3.5% to       \n                 to11.6%        (8.0)%        \n  December       4.6% to8.6%    6.3% to       \n  2021                          (2.6)%        \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       U.S. unemployment rate represents the  \n  \u2022    rate forecasted as of the respective   \n       quarter-end.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Growth/(decline) in U.S. GDP           \n       represents the change in quarterly     \n  \u2022    U.S. GDP relative to the U.S. GDP for  \n       the fourth quarter of 2019             \n       (pre-pandemic levels).                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Recovery of quarterly U.S. GDP to its  \n  \u2022    pre-pandemic levels in the three       \n       scenarios ranges from the quarters     \n       ending March\u00a02021 to September\u00a02022.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       While the U.S. unemployment and U.S.   \n       GDP growth rates are significant       \n       inputs to the forecast model, the      \n       model contemplates a variety of other  \n       inputs across a range of scenarios to  \n  \u2022    provide a forecast of future economic  \n       conditions.

Even though repurchase and resale       \nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d)involve the legal transfer of       \nownership of financial instruments, they are  \naccounted for as financing arrangements       \nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the  \nmaturity of the agreement. The financial      \ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and   \nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.  \ngovernment and agency, and investment-grade   \nsovereign obligations. The firm receives      \nfinancial instruments purchased under resale  \nagreements and makes delivery of financial    \ninstruments sold under repurchase agreements. \nTo mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these financial           \ninstruments on a daily basis, and delivers or \nobtains additional collateral due to changes  \nin the market value of the financial          \ninstruments, as appropriate. For resale       \nagreements, the firm typically requires       \ncollateral with a fair value approximately    \nequal to the carrying value of the relevant   \nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.    \nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions In\na securities borrowed transaction, the firm   \nborrows securities from a counterparty in     \nexchange for cash or securities. When the firm\nreturns the securities, the counterparty      \nreturns the cash or securities. Interest is   \ngenerally paid periodically over the life of  \nthe transaction. In a securities loaned       \ntransaction, the firm lends securities to a   \ncounterparty in exchange for cash or          \nsecurities. When the counterparty returns the \nsecurities, the firm returns the cash or      \nsecurities posted as collateral. Interest is  \ngenerally paid periodically over the life of  \nthe transaction. The firm receives securities \nborrowed and makes delivery of securities     \nloaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm \nmonitors the market value of these securities \non a daily basis, and delivers or obtains     \nadditional collateral due to changes in the   \nmarket value of the securities, as            \nappropriate. For securities borrowed          \ntransactions, the firm typically requires     \ncollateral with a fair value approximately    \nequal to the carrying value of the securities \nborrowed transaction.                         \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form       50  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See\nNote\u00a010 for further\ninformation about\nother secured\nfinancings that are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue.\n\nOther secured\nfinancings that are\nnot recorded at fair\nvalue are recorded\nbased on the amount of\ncash received plus\naccrued interest,\nwhich generally\napproximates fair\nvalue. As these\nfinancings are not\naccounted for at fair\nvalue, they are not\nincluded in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy\nin Notes 4 through 10.\nHad these financings\nbeen included in

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) To estimate the fair value of each\nreporting unit, other than Consumer banking, a\nrelative value technique is used because the  \nfirm believes market participants would use   \nthis technique to value these reporting units.\nThe relative value technique applies          \nobservable price-to-earningsmultiples or      \nprice-to-bookmultiples of comparable          \ncompetitors to reporting units\u2019 net earnings  \nor net book value. To estimate the fair value \nof Consumer banking, a discounted cash flow   \nvaluation approach is used because the firm   \nbelieves market participants would use this   \ntechnique to value that reporting unit given  \nits early stage of development. The estimated \nnet carrying value of each reporting unit     \nreflects an allocation of total shareholders\u2019 \nequity and represents the estimated amount of \ntotal shareholders\u2019 equity required to support\nthe activities of the reporting unit under    \ncurrently applicable regulatory capital       \nrequirements. In the fourth quarter of 2019,  \ngoodwill was tested for impairment using a    \nquantitative test. The estimated fair value of\neach of the reporting units exceeded its      \nrespective net carrying value, and therefore  \ngoodwill was not impaired. During the first   \nhalf of 2020, the outbreak of the             \nCOVID-19pandemic broadly impacted the         \noperating environment. Uncertainty about the  \nCOVID-19pandemic and its continued impact     \npersisted throughout the third quarter of     \n2020. However, the operating environment      \ncontinued to recover from the earlier declines\nin economic and market conditions. Multiple   \nfactors, including performance indicators,    \nfirm and industry events, macroeconomic       \nindicators and fair value indicators, were    \nqualitatively assessed in the third quarter of\n2020 with respect to each of the firm\u2019s       \nreporting units to determine whether it was   \nmore likely than not that the estimated fair  \nvalue of any of these reporting units was less\nthan its estimated carrying value. The        \nqualitative assessment also considered changes\nsince the quantitative test performed in the  \nfourth quarter of 2019. Net revenues for the  \nthird quarter of 2020 were strong across the  \nfirm\u2019s business segments and their respective \nreporting units, reflecting the improvement in\nthe operating environment. Based on the       \nqualitative assessment, the firm determined   \nthat it was more likely than not that the     \nestimated fair value of each of the reporting \nunits exceeded its respective estimated       \ncarrying value, and that the impact of the    \nCOVID-19pandemic through the end of the third \nquarter of 2020 was not a triggering event to \nperform a quantitative test.                  \nIdentifiable Intangible\nAssets.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) In the table above, the weighted  \naverage discount rate represents the firm\u2019s   \nincremental borrowing rate as of January 2019 \nfor operating leases existing on the date of  \nadoption of ASU No. 2016-02and at the lease   \ninception date for leases entered into        \nsubsequent to the adoption of this ASU.       \nOperating lease costs were $ 116million for   \nthe three months ended September 2020, $      \n132million for the three months ended         \nSeptember 2019, $ 339million for the nine     \nmonths ended September 2020 and $ 374million  \nfor the nine months ended September 2019.     \nVariable lease costs, which are included in   \noperating lease costs, were not material for  \neach of the three and nine months ended       \nSeptember 2020 and September 2019. Operating  \nlease liabilities include obligations for     \noffice space held in excess of current        \nrequirements. Operating lease costs relating  \nto space held for growth is included in       \noccupancy expenses.Total occupancy expenses   \nfor space held in excess of the firm\u2019s current\nrequirements were not material for both the   \nnine months ended September 2020 and September\n2019. Lease payments relating to operating    \nlease arrangements that were signed, but had  \nnot yet commenced as of September 2020, were  \nnot material. Note 16. Securitization         \nActivities The firm securitizes residential   \nand commercial mortgages, corporate bonds,    \nloans and other types of financial assets by  \nselling these assets to securitization        \nvehicles (e.g., trusts, corporate entities and\nlimited liability companies) or through a     \nresecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter\nof the beneficial interests that are sold to  \ninvestors. The firm\u2019s residential mortgage    \nsecuritizations are primarily in connection   \nwith government agency securitizations. The   \nfirm accounts for a securitization as a sale  \nwhen it has relinquished control over the     \ntransferred financial assets. Prior to        \nsecuritization, the firm generally accounts   \nfor assets pending transfer at fair value and \ntherefore does not typically recognize        \nsignificant gains or losses upon the transfer \nof assets.

Variable Interest        \nEntities                                      \nA variable interest in\na VIE is an investment\n(e.g., debt or equity)\nor other interest\n(e.g., derivatives or\nloans and lending\ncommitments) that will\nabsorb portions of the\nVIE\u2019s expected losses\nand/or receive\nportions of the VIE\u2019s\nexpected residual\nreturns.\n\nThe firm\u2019s variable\ninterests in VIEs\ninclude senior and\nsubordinated debt;\nloans and lending\ncommitments; limited\nand general\npartnership interests;\npreferred and common\nequity; derivatives\nthat may include\nforeign currency,\nequity and/or credit\nrisk; guarantees; and\ncertain of the fees\nthe firm receives from\ninvestment funds.\nCertain interest rate,\nforeign currency and\ncredit derivatives the\nfirm enters into with\nVIEs are not variable\ninterests because they\ncreate, rather than\nabsorb, risk.\n\nVIEs generally finance\nthe purchase of assets\nby issuing debt and\nequity securities that\nare either\ncollateralized by or\nindexed to the assets\nheld by the VIE. The\ndebt and equity\nsecurities issued by a\nVIE may include\ntranches of varying\nlevels of\nsubordination. The\nfirm\u2019s involvement\nwith VIEs includes\nsecuritization of\nfinancial assets, as\ndescribed in Note 16,\nand investments in and\nloans to other types\nof VIEs, as described\nbelow.

The firm        \nreassesses its determination of whether it is \nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and              \ncircumstances. VIE Activities The firm is     \nprincipally involved with VIEs through the    \nfollowing business activities: Mortgage-Backed\nVIEs. The firm sells residential and          \ncommercial mortgage loans and securities to   \nmortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial\ninterests in the assets sold to these VIEs.   \nThe firm purchases and sells beneficial       \ninterests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in   \nconnection with market-making activities. In  \naddition, the firm may enter into derivatives \nwith certain of these VIEs, primarily interest\nrate swaps, which are typically not variable  \ninterests. The firm generally enters into     \nderivatives with other counterparties to      \nmitigate its risk. Real Estate, Credit- and   \nPower-Related and Other Investing VIEs. The   \nfirm purchases equity and debt securities     \nissued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold   \nreal estate, performing and nonperforming     \ndebt, distressed loans, power-related assets  \nand equity securities. The firm generally does\nnot sell assets to, or enter into derivatives \nwith, these VIEs. Corporate Debt and Other    \nAsset-Backed VIEs. The firm structures VIEs   \nthat issue notes to clients, purchases and    \nsells beneficial interests issued by corporate\ndebt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection\nwith market-making activities, and makes loans\nto VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain\nof these VIEs synthetically create the        \nexposure for the beneficial interests they    \nissue by entering into credit derivatives with\nthe firm, rather than purchasing the          \nunderlying assets. In addition, the firm may  \nenter into derivatives, such as total return  \nswaps, with certain corporate debt and other  \nasset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays  \nthe VIE a return due to the beneficial        \ninterest holders and receives the return on   \nthe collateral owned by the VIE. The          \ncollateral owned by these VIEs is primarily   \nother asset-backed loans and securities. The  \nfirm may be removed as the total return swap  \ncounterparty and may enter into derivatives   \nwith other counterparties to mitigate its risk\nrelated to these swaps. The firm may sell     \nassets to the corporate debt and other asset- \nbacked VIEs it structures.                    \n                                              \n  63    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Commercial Lending. The firm\u2019s    \ncommercial lending commitments were primarily \nextended to investment-grade corporate        \nborrowers. Such commitments primarily included\n$ 106.08billion as of September 2020 and $    \n102.50billion as of December 2019, related to \nrelationship lending activities (principally  \nused for operating and general corporate      \npurposes) and $ 14.69billion as of September  \n2020 and $ 33.47billion as of December 2019,  \nrelated to other investment banking activities\n(generally extended for contingent acquisition\nfinancing and are often intended to be short- \nterm in nature, as borrowers often seek to    \nreplace them with other funding sources). The \nfirm also extends lending commitments in      \nconnection with other types of corporate      \nlending, as well as commercial real estate    \nfinancing. See Note 9 for further information \nabout funded loans. To mitigate the credit    \nrisk associated with the firm\u2019s commercial    \nlending activities, the firm obtains credit   \nprotection on certain loans and lending       \ncommitments through credit default swaps, both\nsingle-name and index-based contracts, and    \nthrough the issuance of credit-linked notes.  \nIn addition, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, \nInc. (SMFG) provides the firm with credit loss\nprotection on certain approved loan           \ncommitments (primarily investment-grade       \ncommercial lending commitments), for which the\nnotional amount was $ 3.21billion as of       \nSeptember 2020 and $ 5.74billion as of        \nDecember 2019. The credit loss protection on  \nloan commitments provided by SMFG is generally\nlimited to 95% of the first loss the firm     \nrealizes on such commitments, up to a maximum \nof approximately $ 950million. In addition,   \nsubject to the satisfaction of certain        \nconditions, upon the firm\u2019s request, SMFG will\nprovide protection for 70% of additional      \nlosses on such commitments, up to a maximum of\n$ 750million, of which noprotection had been  \nprovided as of September 2020 and December    \n2019. Warehouse Financing. The firm provides  \nfinancing to clients who warehouse financial  \nassets. These arrangements are secured by the \nwarehoused assets, primarily consisting of    \nresidential real estate, consumer and         \ncorporate loans. Credit Cards. The firm\u2019s     \ncredit card lending commitments represents    \ncredit card lines issued by the firm to       \nconsumers. These credit card lines are        \ncancellable by the firm. Collateralized       \nAgreement Commitments/ Collateralized         \nFinancing Commitments Collateralized agreement\ncommitments includes forward starting resale  \nand securities borrowing agreements, and      \ncollateralized financing commitments includes \nforward starting repurchase and secured       \nlending agreements that settle at a future    \ndate, generally within three business days.   \nCollateralized agreement commitments also     \nincludes transactions where the firm has      \nentered into commitments to provide contingent\nfinancing to its clients and counterparties   \nthrough resale agreements. The firm\u2019s funding \nof these commitments depends on the           \nsatisfaction of all contractual conditions to \nthe resale agreement and these commitments can\nexpire unused. Letters of Credit The firm has \ncommitments under letters of credit issued by \nvarious banks which the firm provides to      \ncounterparties in lieu of securities or cash  \nto satisfy various collateral and margin      \ndeposit requirements. Investment Commitments  \nInvestment commitments includes commitments to\ninvest in private equity, real estate and     \nother assets directly and through funds that  \nthe firm raises and manages. Investment       \ncommitments included $ 1.82billion as of      \nSeptember 2020 and $ 2.06billion as of        \nDecember 2019, related to commitments to      \ninvest in funds managed by the firm. If these \ncommitments are called, they would be funded  \nat market value on the date of investment.    \nContingencies Legal Proceedings. See Note 27  \nfor information about legal proceedings,      \nincluding certain mortgage-related matters.   \nCertain Mortgage-Related Contingencies. During\nthe period 2005 through 2008 in connection    \nwith both sales and securitizations of loans, \nthe firm provided loan-level representations  \nand/or assigned the loan-level representations\nfrom the party from whom the firm purchased   \nthe loans. Based on the large number of       \ndefaults in residential mortgages, including  \nthose sold or securitized by the firm, there  \nis a potential for repurchase claims. However,\nthe firm is not in a position to make a       \nmeaningful estimate of that exposure at this  \ntime. The firm\u2019s exposure to claims for       \nrepurchase of residential mortgage loans based\non alleged breaches of representations will   \ndepend on a number of factors, such as the    \nextent to which these claims are made within  \nthe statute of limitations, taking into       \nconsideration the agreements to toll the      \nstatute of limitations the firm entered into  \nwith trustees representing certain trusts.    \n                                              \n  67    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm enters into   \nvarious derivatives that meet the definition  \nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including     \nwritten equity and commodity put options,     \nwritten currency contracts and interest rate  \ncaps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives \nare risk managed together with derivatives    \nthat do not meet the definition of a          \nguarantee, and therefore the amounts in the   \ntable above do not reflect the firm\u2019s overall \nrisk related to derivative activities.        \nDisclosures about derivatives are not required\nif they may be cash settled and the firm has  \nno basis to conclude it is probable that the  \ncounterparties held the underlying instruments\nat inception of the contract. The firm has    \nconcluded that these conditions have been met \nfor certain large, internationally active     \ncommercial and investment bank counterparties,\ncentral clearing counterparties, hedge funds  \nand certain other counterparties.Accordingly, \nthe firm has not included such contracts in   \nthe table above. See Note 7 for information   \nabout credit derivatives that meet the        \ndefinition of a guarantee, which are not      \nincluded in the table above. Derivatives are  \naccounted for at fair value and therefore the \ncarrying value is considered the best         \nindication of payment/performance risk for    \nindividual contracts. However, the carrying   \nvalues in the table above exclude the effect  \nof counterparty and cash collateral netting.  \nSecurities Lending Indemnifications. The firm,\nin its capacity as an agency lender,          \nindemnifies most of its securities lending    \ncustomers against losses incurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not return securities and   \nthe collateral held is insufficient to cover  \nthe market value of the securities borrowed.  \nCollateral held by the lenders in connection  \nwith securities lending indemnifications was $\n21.50billion as of September 2020 and $       \n19.14billion as of December 2019. Because the \ncontractual nature of these arrangements      \nrequires the firm to obtain collateral with a \nmarket value that exceeds the value of the    \nsecurities lent to the borrower, there is     \nminimal performance risk associated with these\nguarantees. Other Financial Guarantees. In the\nordinary course of business, the firm provides\nother financial guarantees of the obligations \nof third parties (e.g., standby letters of    \ncredit and other guarantees to enable clients \nto complete transactions and fund-related     \nguarantees). These guarantees represent       \nobligations to make payments to beneficiaries \nif the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its  \nobligation under a contractual arrangement    \nwith that beneficiary. Other financial        \nguarantees also include a guarantee that the  \nfirm has provided to the Government of        \nMalaysia that it will receive at least $      \n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets \nseized by governmental authorities around the \nworld related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad,\na sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB).   \nSee Note 27 for further information.          \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form       68  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Guarantees of Securities Issued by\nTrusts. The firm has established trusts,      \nincluding Goldman Sachs Capital I, the APEX   \nTrusts and other entities, for the limited    \npurpose of issuing securities to third        \nparties, lending the proceeds to the firm and \nentering into contractual arrangements with   \nthe firm and third parties related to this    \npurpose. The firm does not consolidate these  \nentities. See Note 14 for further information \nabout the transactions involving Goldman Sachs\nCapital I and the APEX Trusts. The firm       \neffectively provides for the full and         \nunconditional guarantee of the securities     \nissued by these entities. Timely payment by   \nthe firm of amounts due to these entities     \nunder the guarantee, borrowing, preferred     \nstock and related contractual arrangements    \nwill be sufficient to cover payments due on   \nthe securities issued by these entities.      \nManagement believes that it is unlikely that  \nany circumstances will occur, such as         \nnonperformance on the part of paying agents or\nother service providers, that would make it   \nnecessary for the firm to make payments       \nrelated to these entities other than those    \nrequired under the terms of the guarantee,    \nborrowing, preferred stock and related        \ncontractual arrangements and in connection    \nwith certain expenses incurred by these       \nentities. Indemnities and Guarantees of       \nService Providers. In the ordinary course of  \nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees \ncertain service providers, such as clearing   \nand custody agents, trustees and              \nadministrators, against specified potential   \nlosses in connection with their acting as an  \nagent of, or providing services to, the firm  \nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses   \narising from its custodial role or caused by  \nacts or omissions of third-party service      \nproviders, including sub-custodiansand third- \nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has \nthe right to seek indemnification from these  \nthird-party service providers for certain     \nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In      \naddition, the firm is a member of payment,    \nclearing and settlement networks, as well as  \nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of   \nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of   \nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In  \nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear \nand settle on behalf of its clients the       \ntransactions entered into by them with other  \nbrokerage firms. The firm\u2019s obligations in    \nrespect of such transactions are secured by   \nthe assets in the client\u2019s account, as well as\nany proceeds received from the transactions   \ncleared and settled by the firm on behalf of  \nthe client. In connection with joint venture  \ninvestments, the firm may issue loan          \nguarantees under which it may be liable in the\nevent of fraud, misappropriation,             \nenvironmental liabilities and certain other   \nmatters involving the borrower. The firm is   \nunable to develop an estimate of the maximum  \npayout under these guarantees and             \nindemnifications. However, management believes\nthat it is unlikely the firm will have to make\nany material payments under these             \narrangements, and no material liabilities     \nrelated to these guarantees and               \nindemnifications have been recognized in the  \nconsolidated balance sheets as of both        \nSeptember 2020 and December 2019. Other       \nRepresentations, Warranties and               \nIndemnifications. The firm provides           \nrepresentations and warranties to             \ncounterparties in connection with a variety of\ncommercial transactions and occasionally      \nindemnifies them against potential losses     \ncaused by the breach of those representations \nand warranties. The firm may also provide     \nindemnifications protecting against changes in\nor adverse application of certain U.S. tax    \nlaws in connection with ordinary-course       \ntransactions, such as securities issuances,   \nborrowings or derivatives. In addition, the   \nfirm may provide indemnifications to some     \ncounterparties to protect them in the event   \nadditional taxes are owed or payments are     \nwithheld, due either to a change in or an     \nadverse application of certain non-U.S.tax    \nlaws. These indemnifications generally are    \nstandard contractual terms and are entered    \ninto in the ordinary course of business.      \nGenerally, there are no stated or notional    \namounts included in these indemnifications,   \nand the contingencies triggering the          \nobligation to indemnify are not expected to   \noccur. The firm is unable to develop an       \nestimate of the maximum payout under these    \nguarantees and indemnifications. However,     \nmanagement believes that it is unlikely the   \nfirm will have to make any material payments  \nunder these arrangements, and no material     \nliabilities related to these arrangements have\nbeen recognized in the consolidated balance   \nsheets as of both September 2020 and December \n2019.                                         \n                                              \n  69    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Shareholders\u2019 Equity      \nCommon Equity As of both September 2020 and   \nDecember 2019, the firm had 4.00billion       \nauthorized shares of common stock and         \n200million authorized shares of nonvoting     \ncommon stock, each with a par value of $      \n0.01per share. The firm\u2019s share repurchase    \nprogram is intended to help maintain the      \nappropriate level of common equity. The share \nrepurchase program is effected primarily      \nthrough regular open-market purchases (which  \nmay include repurchase plans designed to      \ncomply with Rule 10b5-1and accelerated share  \nrepurchases), the amounts and timing of which \nare determined primarily by the firm\u2019s current\nand projected capital position, and capital   \ndeployment opportunities, but which may also  \nbe influenced by general market conditions and\nthe prevailing price and trading volumes of   \nthe firm\u2019s common stock. The firm suspended   \nstock repurchases during the first quarter of \n2020 and through the third quarter of 2020.   \nConsistent with the FRB\u2019s requirement for all \nlarge bank holding companies (BHCs), the firm \nhas extended the suspension of stock          \nrepurchases through the fourth quarter of     \n2020.                                         \nThe table below\npresents information\nabout common stock\nrepurchases.\n                                              \n                 September\u00a0                   \n                 2020                         \n  in\u00a0                                         \n  millions,      Three\u00a0                 Nine  \n  except per     MonthsEnded     MonthsEnded  \n  share                                       \n  amounts                                     \n  Common                                      \n  share          \u2013                       8.2  \n  repurchases                                 \n  Average                                     \n  cost per       $\u2013                  $236.35  \n  share                                       \n  Total\u00a0cost\u00a0                                 \n  of\u00a0common\u00a0     $\u2013                   $1,928  \n  share\u00a0                                      \n  repurchases                                 \n                                              \nPursuant to the terms\nof certain share-based\ncompensation plans,\nemployees may remit\nshares to the firm or\nthe firm may cancel\nshare-based awards to\nsatisfy statutory\nemployee tax\nwithholding\nrequirements.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Note 20. Regulation and Capital   \nAdequacy The FRB is the primary regulator of  \nGroup Inc., a BHC under the U.S. Bank Holding \nCompany Act of 1956 and a financial holding   \ncompany under amendments to this Act. The firm\nis subject to consolidated regulatory capital \nrequirements which are calculated in          \naccordance with the regulations of the FRB    \n(Capital Framework). The capital requirements \nare expressed as risk-based capital and       \nleverage ratios that compare measures of      \nregulatory capital to risk-weighted assets    \n(RWAs), average assets and off-balancesheet   \nexposures. Failure to comply with these       \ncapital requirements could result in          \nrestrictions being imposed by the firm\u2019s      \nregulators and could limit the firm\u2019s ability \nto repurchase shares, pay dividends and make  \ncertain discretionary compensation payments.  \nThe firm\u2019s capital levels are also subject to \nqualitative judgments by the regulators about \ncomponents of capital, risk weightings and    \nother factors. Furthermore, certain of the    \nfirm\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to separate   \nregulations and capital requirements. Capital \nFramework The regulations under the Capital   \nFramework are largely based on the Basel      \nCommittee on Banking Supervision\u2019s (Basel     \nCommittee) capital framework for strengthening\ninternational capital standards (Basel III)   \nand also implement certain provisions of the  \nDodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework,  \nthe firm is an \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking    \norganization and has been designated as a     \nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB).   \nThe capital requirements calculated in        \naccordance with the Capital Framework include \nthe minimum risk-based capital and leverage   \nratios. In addition, the risk-based capital   \nrequirements include the capital conservation \nbuffer, countercyclical capital buffer and the\nG-SIBsurcharge, all of which must consist     \nentirely of capital that qualifies as Common  \nEquity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. The firm        \ncalculates its CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital   \nand Total capital ratios in accordance with   \n(i) the Standardized approach and market risk \nrules set out in the Capital Framework        \n(together, the Standardized Capital Rules) and\n(ii) the Advanced approach and market risk    \nrules set out in the Capital Framework        \n(together, the Advanced Capital Rules). The   \nlower of each risk-based capital ratio        \ncalculated in (i) and (ii) is the ratio       \nagainst which the firm\u2019s compliance with its  \nrisk-based capital requirements is assessed.  \nUnder the Capital Framework, the firm is also \nsubject to leverage requirements which consist\nof a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a      \nminimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), as\nwell as the SLR buffer.                       \nConsolidated Regulatory\nRisk-Based Capital and\nLeverage Ratios\nThe table below\npresents the risk-based\ncapital and leverage\nrequirements as of both\nSeptember 2020 and\nDecember 2019.\n                                              \n                                Requirements  \n  Risk-based capital                          \n  requirements                                \n  CET1 capital ratio            9.5%          \n  Tier\u00a01 capital ratio          11.0%         \n  Total capital ratio           13.0%         \n  Leverage requirements                       \n  Tier\u00a01 leverage ratio         4.0%          \n  SLR                           5.0%          \n                                              \nBeginning on October 1,\n2020, the Standardized\ncapital ratio\nrequirements include\nthe stressed capital\nbuffer (SCB), which has\nreplaced the capital\nconservation buffer.\nThe SCB is determined\nby the FRB based on\ninstitution-specific\nComprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review\nresults.

For\nrisk management\npurposes, a 95 % one-\nday VaR is used,\nwhereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements,\na 99 % 10-day VaR is\nused to determine\nMarket RWAs and a 99 %\none-day VaR is used to\ndetermine regulatory\nVaR exceptions. In\naddition, the daily\nnet revenues used to\ndetermine risk\nmanagement VaR\nexceptions (i.e.,\ncomparing the daily\nnet revenues to the\nVaR measure calculated\nas of the end of the\nprior business day)\ninclude intraday\nactivity, whereas the\nCapital Framework\nrequires that intraday\nactivity be excluded\nfrom daily net\nrevenues when\ncalculating regulatory\nVaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity\nincludes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are\nmore likely than not\nto be positive by\ntheir nature. As a\nresult, there may be\ndifferences in the\nnumber of VaR\nexceptions and the\namount of daily net\nrevenues calculated\nfor regulatory VaR\ncompared to the\namounts calculated for\nrisk management VaR.\n\nThe firm\u2019s positional\nlosses observed on a\nsingle day exceeded\nits 99 % one-day\nregulatory VaR on six\noccasions during the\nnine months ended\nSeptember\u00a02020 (all of\nwhich occurred during\nMarch\u00a02020) and\nexceeded its 99 % one-\nday regulatory VaR on\none occasion during\nthe year ended\nDecember\u00a02019.

a\ndecrease in\ncommitments,\nguarantees and loans,\nprincipally due to\nreduced lending\nexposures, a decrease\nin equity investments,\nprincipally due to the\nsale of certain equity\npositions, and a\ndecrease in securities\nfinancing\ntransactions,\nprincipally due to\nreduced funding\nexposures.\nStandardized Market\nRWAs as of September\n2020 increased by $\n15.73billion compared\nwith December 2019,\nprimarily reflecting\nincreases in\nregulatory VaR and\nstressed VaR,\nprincipally due to\nincreased market\nvolatility.\nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of September 2020     \nincreased by $ 29.68billion compared with     \nDecember 2019, primarily reflecting an        \nincrease in derivatives, principally due to   \nthe impact of higher levels of volatility and \ncounterparty credit risk. This increase was   \npartially offset by a decrease in equity      \ninvestments, principally due to the sale of   \ncertain equity positions. Advanced Market RWAs\nas of September 2020 increased by $           \n15.93billion compared with December 2019,     \nprimarily reflecting increases in regulatory  \nVaR and stressed VaR, principally due to      \nincreased market volatility. Advanced         \nOperational RWAs as of September 2020         \nincreased by $ 9.36billion compared with      \nDecember 2019. The vast majority of this      \nincrease was associated with litigation and   \nregulatory proceedings. Year Ended December   \n2019. Standardized Credit RWAs as of December \n2019 increased by $ 25.65billion compared with\nDecember 2018, primarily reflecting an        \nincrease in commitments, guarantees and loans,\nprincipally due to an increase in lending     \nactivity, and an increase in other credit     \nRWAs, principally due to the recognition of   \noperating lease right-of-useassets upon       \nadoption of ASU No. 2016-02and an increase in \ncorporate debt exposures. Standardized Market \nRWAs as of December 2019 decreased by $       \n9.98billion compared with December 2018,      \nprimarily reflecting a decrease in specific   \nrisk, principally due to reduced exposures,   \nand a decrease in incremental risk,           \nprincipally due to reduced exposures and      \nchanges in risk measurements. Advanced Credit \nRWAs as of December 2019 decreased by $       \n7.67billion compared with December 2018.      \nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, the  \nfirm made changes to the calculation of the   \nloss given default for certain wholesale      \nexposures which resulted in a decrease in     \ncredit RWAs, primarily in commitments,        \nguarantees and loans and derivatives. This    \ndecrease was partially offset by an increase  \nin other credit RWAs, principally due to the  \nrecognition of operating lease right-of-      \nuseassets upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02and \nan increase in corporate debt exposures.      \nAdvanced Market RWAs as of December 2019      \ndecreased by $ 10.19billion compared with     \nDecember 2018, primarily reflecting a decrease\nin specific risk, principally due to reduced  \nexposures, and a decrease in incremental risk,\nprincipally due to reduced exposures and      \nchanges in risk measurements. Advanced        \nOperational RWAs as of December 2019 increased\nby $ 4.40billion compared with December 2018, \nassociated with litigation and regulatory     \nproceedings.                                  \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form       78  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The deposits of\nGS Bank USA are\ninsured by the FDIC to\nthe extent provided by\nlaw. The FRB requires\nthat GS Bank USA\nmaintain cash reserves\nwith the Federal\nReserve. The amount\ndeposited by GS Bank\nUSA at the Federal\nReserve was $\n63.69billion as of\nSeptember 2020 and $\n50.55billion as of\nDecember 2019, which\nexceeded required\nreserve amounts by $\n63.69billion as of\nSeptember 2020 (as the\nFRB reduced reserve\nrequirement ratios to\nzero percent in 2020)\nand $ 50.29billion as\nof December 2019.\nRestrictions on Payments Group Inc. may be    \nlimited in its ability to access capital held \nat certain subsidiaries as a result of        \nregulatory, tax or other constraints. These   \nlimitations include provisions of applicable  \nlaw and regulations and other regulatory      \nrestrictions that limit the ability of those  \nsubsidiaries to declare and pay dividends     \nwithout prior regulatory approval. As a result\nof GS Bank USA\u2019s election to exclude holdings \nof U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at   \nthe Federal Reserve from its total leverage   \nexposure, any dividend by GS Bank USA during  \nthe period from July 1, 2020 through March 31,\n2021 is subject to the prior approval of the  \nFRB. Furthermore, the amount of dividends that\nmay be paid by GS Bank USA are limited to the \nlesser of the amounts calculated under a      \nrecent earnings test and an undivided profits \ntest. The FRB, the FDIC and the NYDFS have    \nauthority to prohibit or to limit the payment \nof dividends by the banking organizations they\nsupervise (including GS Bank USA) if, in the  \nregulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend    \nwould constitute an unsafe or unsound practice\nin light of the financial condition of the    \nbanking organization. In addition,            \nsubsidiaries not subject to separate          \nregulatory capital requirements may hold      \ncapital to satisfy local tax and legal        \nguidelines, rating agency requirements (for   \nentities with assigned credit ratings) or     \ninternal policies, including policies         \nconcerning the minimum amount of capital a    \nsubsidiary should hold based on its underlying\nlevel of risk. Group Inc.\u2019s equity investment \nin subsidiaries was $ 99.52billion as of      \nSeptember 2020 and $ 95.68billion as of       \nDecember 2019, of which Group Inc. was        \nrequired to maintain $ 60.88billion as of     \nSeptember 2020 and $ 57.58billion as of       \nDecember 2019, of minimum equity capital in   \nits regulated subsidiaries in order to satisfy\nthe regulatory requirements of such           \nsubsidiaries. Group Inc.\u2019s capital invested in\ncertain non-U.S.subsidiaries is exposed to    \nforeign exchange risk, substantially all of   \nwhich is managed through a combination of     \nderivatives and non-U.S.denominated debt.

During the\nfirst nine months of\n2020, the firm reached\nan agreement with the\nIRS on certain items\nrelated to tax years\nthrough 2017, which\ndid not have a\nmaterial impact on the\neffective tax rate.\nThe final resolution\nof the audit for tax\nyears 2011 through\n2017 is not expected\nto have a material\nimpact on the\neffective tax rate.\nThe 2018 and 2019 tax\nyears remain subject\nto post-filing review.\n\nNew York State\nexaminations\n(excluding GS Bank\nUSA) of 2011 through\n2014 began in 2017.\nDuring the first nine\nmonths of 2020, New\nYork City\u2019s\nexamination of the tax\nyears 2011 through\n2014 was completed.\nThe resolution of this\nexamination did not\nhave a material impact\non the effective tax\nrate. New York State\nand City examinations\nfor GS Bank USA have\nbeen completed through\n2014.\n\nAll years, including\nand subsequent to the\nyears in the table\nabove, remain open to\nexamination by the\ntaxing authorities.\nThe firm believes that\nthe liability for\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits it has\nestablished is\nadequate in relation\nto the potential for\nadditional\nassessments.\nNote 25. Business Segments The firm reports   \nits activities in four business segments:     \nInvestment Banking, Global Markets, Asset     \nManagement and Consumer & Wealth Management.  \nSee Note 1 for information about the firm\u2019s   \nbusiness segments. Compensation and benefits  \nexpenses in the firm\u2019s segments reflect, among\nother factors, the overall performance of the \nfirm, as well as the performance of individual\nbusinesses. Consequently, pre-taxmargins in   \none segment of the firm\u2019s business may be     \nsignificantly affected by the performance of  \nthe firm\u2019s other business segments. The firm  \nallocates assets (including allocations of    \nglobal core liquid assets and cash, secured   \nclient financing and other assets), revenues  \nand expenses among the four business segments.\nDue to the integrated nature of these         \nsegments, estimates and judgments are made in \nallocating certain assets, revenues and       \nexpenses. The allocation process is based on  \nthe manner in which management currently views\nthe performance of the segments. The          \nallocation of common shareholders\u2019 equity and \npreferred stock dividends to each segment is  \nbased on the estimated amount of equity       \nrequired to support the activities of the     \nsegment under relevant regulatory capital     \nrequirements. Net earnings for each segment is\ncalculated by applying the firmwide tax rate  \nto each segment\u2019s pre-taxearnings. Management \nbelieves that this allocation provides a      \nreasonable representation of each segment\u2019s   \ncontribution to consolidated net earnings to  \ncommon, return on average common equity and   \ntotal assets. Transactions between segments   \nare based on specific criteria or approximate \nthird-party rates.                            \n                                              \n  83    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form     \n        10-Q                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Many of these proceedings are in  \nearly stages, and many of these cases seek an \nindeterminate amount of damages. Under ASC    \n450, an event is \u201creasonably possible\u201d if \u201cthe\nchance of the future event or events occurring\nis more than remote but less than likely\u201d and \nan event is \u201cremote\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the    \nfuture event or events occurring is slight.\u201d  \nThus, references to the upper end of the range\nof reasonably possible loss for cases in which\nthe firm is able to estimate a range of       \nreasonably possible loss mean the upper end of\nthe range of loss for cases for which the firm\nbelieves the risk of loss is more than slight.\nWith respect to matters described below for   \nwhich management has been able to estimate a  \nrange of reasonably possible loss where (i)   \nactual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an\namount of money damages, (ii) the firm is     \nbeing, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers\nin a securities offering and is not being     \nindemnified by a party that the firm believes \nwill pay the full amount of any judgment, or  \n(iii) the purchasers are demanding that the   \nfirm repurchase securities, management has    \nestimated the upper end of the range of       \nreasonably possible loss as being equal to (a)\nin the case of (i), the amount of money       \ndamages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the \ndifference between the initial sales price of \nthe securities that the firm sold in such     \noffering and the estimated lowest subsequent  \nprice of such securities prior to the action  \nbeing commenced and (c) in the case of (iii), \nthe price that purchasers paid for the        \nsecurities less the estimated value, if any,  \nas of September 2020 of the relevant          \nsecurities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and    \n(iii), taking into account any other factors  \nbelieved to be relevant to the particular     \nmatter or matters of that type. As of the date\nhereof, the firm has estimated the upper end  \nof the range of reasonably possible aggregate \nloss for such matters and for any other       \nmatters described below where management has  \nbeen able to estimate a range of reasonably   \npossible aggregate loss to be approximately $ \n0.9billion in excess of the aggregate reserves\nfor such matters.                             \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form       86  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Management is generally unable to \nestimate a range of reasonably possible loss  \nfor matters other than those included in the  \nestimate above, including where (i) actual or \npotential plaintiffs have not claimed an      \namount of money damages, except in those      \ninstances where management can otherwise      \ndetermine an appropriate amount, (ii) matters \nare in early stages, (iii) matters relate to  \nregulatory investigations or reviews, except  \nin those instances where management can       \notherwise determine an appropriate amount,    \n(iv) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood\nof a class being certified or the ultimate    \nsize of the class, (v) there is uncertainty as\nto the outcome of pending appeals or motions, \n(vi) there are significant factual issues to  \nbe resolved, and/or (vii) there are novel     \nlegal issues presented. For example, the      \nfirm\u2019s potential liabilities with respect to  \nthe investigations and reviews described below\nin \u201cRegulatory Investigations and Reviews and \nRelated Litigation\u201d generally are not included\nin management\u2019s estimate of reasonably        \npossible loss. However, management does not   \nbelieve, based on currently available         \ninformation, that the outcomes of such other  \nmatters will have a material adverse effect on\nthe firm\u2019s financial condition, though the    \noutcomes could be material to the firm\u2019s      \noperating results for any particular period,  \ndepending, in part, upon the operating results\nfor such period.

Leissner pleaded guilty to a two-   \ncountcriminal information charging him with   \nconspiring to launder money and conspiring to \nviolate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices    \nAct\u2019s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal        \naccounting controls provisions. Low and Ng    \nwere charged in a three-count indictment with \nconspiring to launder money and conspiring to \nviolate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery provisions. On\nAugust 28, 2018, Leissner\u2019s guilty plea was   \naccepted by the U.S. District Court for the   \nEastern District of New York and Leissner was \nadjudicated guilty on both counts. Ng was also\ncharged in this indictment with conspiring to \nviolate the FCPA\u2019s internal accounting        \ncontrols provisions. On May 6, 2019, Ng       \npleaded not guilty to the DOJ\u2019s criminal      \ncharges. On February 4, 2020, the FRB         \ndisclosed that Andrea Vella, a former         \nparticipating managing director whom the DOJ  \nhad previously referred to as an unindicted   \nco-conspirator,had agreed, without admitting  \nor denying the FRB\u2019s allegations, to a consent\norder that prohibited him from participating  \nin the banking industry. No other penalties   \nwere imposed by the consent order. On December\n17, 2018, the Attorney General of Malaysia    \nfiled criminal charges in Malaysia against    \nGSI, as the arranger of three offerings of    \ndebt securities of 1MDB, aggregating          \napproximately $ 6.5billion in principal       \namount, for alleged disclosure deficiencies in\nthe offering documents relating to, among     \nother things, the use of proceeds for the debt\nsecurities, as well as against Goldman Sachs  \n(Asia) LLC (GS Asia) and Goldman Sachs        \n(Singapore) PTE (GS Singapore). Criminal      \ncharges have also been filed against Leissner,\nLow, Ng and Jasmine Loo Ai Swan. In a related \npress release, the Attorney General of        \nMalaysia indicated that prosecutors in        \nMalaysia will seek criminal fines against the \naccused in excess of $ 2.7billion plus the $  \n600million of fees received in connection with\nthe debt offerings. On August 9, 2019, the    \nAttorney General of Malaysia announced that   \ncriminal charges had also been filed against  \nseventeen current and former directors of GSI,\nGS Asia and GS Singapore (together with the   \ncriminal charges against GSI, GS Asia and GS  \nSingapore, the Malaysian Criminal             \nProceedings). The Malaysia Securities         \nCommission (MSC) issued notices to show cause \nagainst Goldman Sachs (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (GS  \nMalaysia) in December 2018 and March 2019 that\n(i) allege possible violations of Malaysian   \nsecurities laws and (ii) indicate that the MSC\nis considering whether to revoke GS Malaysia\u2019s\nlicense to conduct corporate finance and fund \nmanagement activities in Malaysia. On August  \n18, 2020, the firm announced that it entered  \ninto a settlement agreement with the          \nGovernment of Malaysia to resolve all the     \ncriminal and regulatory proceedings in        \nMalaysia involving the firm, including the    \nMalaysian Criminal Proceedings and the MSC\u2019s  \nnotices to show cause. The agreement involves \nthe payment to the Government of Malaysia of $\n2.5billion and a guarantee that the Government\nof Malaysia receives at least $ 1.4billion in \nassets and proceeds from assets seized by     \ngovernmental authorities around the world     \nrelated to 1MDB. In addition, the Government  \nof Malaysia agreed to withdraw the Malaysian  \nCriminal Proceedings and agreed that no       \nfurther charges would be brought against Group\nInc., its affiliates and subsidiaries, or any \nof their directors and officers (excluding    \nLeissner and Ng) related to 1MDB.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) On October 22, 2020, the firm     \nannounced that it reached settlements of      \ngovernmental and regulatory investigations    \nrelating to 1MDB with the DOJ, the SEC, the   \nFRB, the NYDFS, the FCA, the PRA, the         \nSingapore Attorney General\u2019s Chambers, the    \nSingapore Commercial Affairs Department, the  \nMonetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong  \nKong Securities and Futures Commission. Group \nInc. entered into a three-year deferred       \nprosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a\ncharge against the firm, one count of         \nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and \nwill later be dismissed if the firm abides by \nthe terms of the agreement. In addition, GS   \nMalaysia pleaded guilty to one count of       \nconspiracy to violate the FCPA. The firm will \npay total penalties, after crediting, of      \napproximately $ 2.6billion in connection with \nthe settlements. A separate obligation to pay \n$ 606million in disgorgement has been credited\nand satisfied as a result of the firm\u2019s       \nearlier settlement with the Government of     \nMalaysia, described above. This brings the    \ntotal payments in connection with governmental\nand regulatory settlements relating to 1MDB to\nan aggregate of approximately $ 5.1billion.   \nThe firm has been working to secure necessary \nexemptions and authorizations from regulators \nso that the settlements announced on October  \n22, 2020, do not impact the firm\u2019s activities \nor the services that it provides to clients.  \nThe firm has already submitted its application\nto the U.S. Department of Labor to maintain   \nits status as a qualified professional asset  \nmanager (QPAM), and expects to obtain the     \nexemption before the sentencing of GS         \nMalaysia.

On December 13, 2019,  \nan alleged shareholder filed a lawsuit in the \nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware    \nseeking books and records relating to, among  \nother things, the firm\u2019s involvement with 1MDB\nand the firm\u2019s compliance procedures. The     \nparties have agreed to stay proceedings       \npending resolution of the books and records   \ndemand. On February 19, 2019, a purported     \nshareholder derivative action relating to 1MDB\nwas filed in the U.S. District Court for the  \nSouthern District of New York against Group   \nInc. and the directors at the time and a      \nformer chairman and chief executive officer of\nthe firm. The amended complaint filed on July \n12, 2019, which seeks unspecified damages,    \ndisgorgement and injunctive relief, alleges   \nbreaches of fiduciary duties, including in    \nconnection with alleged insider trading by    \ncertain current and former directors, unjust  \nenrichment and violations of the anti-fraud   \nprovisions of the Exchange Act, including in  \nconnection with Group Inc.\u2019s common stock     \nrepurchases and solicitation of proxies.      \nDefendants moved to dismiss this action on    \nSeptember 12, 2019. Beginning in March 2019,  \nthe firm has also received demands from       \nalleged shareholders to investigate and pursue\nclaims against certain current and former     \ndirectors and executive officers based on     \ntheir oversight and public disclosures        \nregarding 1MDB and related internal controls. \nOn November 21, 2018, a summons with notice   \nwas filed in New York Supreme Court, County of\nNew York, by International Petroleum          \nInvestment Company, which guaranteed certain  \ndebt securities issued by 1MDB, and its       \nsubsidiary Aabar Investments PJS. The summons \nwith notice makes unspecified claims relating \nto 1MDB and seeks unspecified compensatory and\npunitive damages and other relief against     \nGroup Inc., GSI, GS Asia, GS Singapore, GS    \nMalaysia, Leissner, Ng, and Vella, as well as \nindividuals (who are not current or former    \nemployees of the firm) previously associated  \nwith the plaintiffs. On October 20, 2020,     \npursuant to a stipulation between the         \nplaintiffs, the firm and other defendants, the\ncourt entered an order discontinuing the      \naction with prejudice. On December 20, 2018, a\nputative securities class action lawsuit was  \nfiled in the U.S. District Court for the      \nSouthern District of New York against Group   \nInc. and certain former officers of the firm  \nalleging violations of the anti-fraud         \nprovisions of the Exchange Act with respect to\nGroup Inc.\u2019s disclosures concerning 1MDB and  \nseeking unspecified damages. The plaintiffs   \nfiled the second amended complaint on October \n28, 2019, which the defendants moved to       \ndismiss on January 9, 2020.

Executive Overview Three Months  \nEnded September 2020 versus September 2019. We\ngenerated net earnings of $3.37 billion for   \nthe third quarter of 2020, an increase of 79% \ncompared with $1.88 billion for the third     \nquarter of 2019. Diluted earnings per common  \nshare (EPS) was $8.98 for the third quarter of\n2020, an increase of 87% compared with $4.79  \nfor the third quarter of 2019. Annualized     \nreturn on average common shareholders\u2019 equity \n(ROE) was 16.2% for the third quarter of 2020,\ncompared with 9.0% for the third quarter of   \n2019. Book value per common share was $228.78 \nas of September 2020, 4.6% higher compared    \nwith September 2019. Net revenues were $10.78 \nbillion for the third quarter of 2020, 30%    \nhigher than the third quarter of 2019,        \nreflecting higher net revenues across all     \nsegments, including significant increases in  \nAsset Management, primarily due to significant\nnet gains from investments in public equities,\nand Global Markets, driven by continued       \nstrength in Fixed Income, Currency and        \nCommodities (FICC) and Equities. Provision for\ncredit losses was $278 million for the third  \nquarter of 2020, 4% lower than the third      \nquarter of 2019, primarily reflecting reserve \nreductions from paydowns on corporate lines of\ncredit and consumer installment loans,        \npartially offset by reserve increases from    \nindividual impairments related to wholesale   \nloans and growth in credit card loans.        \nOperating expenses were $6.20 billion for the \nthird quarter of 2020, 10% higher than the    \nthird quarter of 2019, due to higher          \ncompensation and benefits expenses, reflecting\nsignificantly higher net revenues, and higher \nnon-compensationexpenses, driven by           \nsignificantly higher net provisions for       \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings. Our    \nefficiency ratio (total operating expenses    \ndivided by total net revenues) for the third  \nquarter of 2020 was 57.5%, compared with 67.5%\nfor the third quarter of 2019. During the     \nthird quarter of 2020, we returned $448       \nmillion of capital in common stock dividends. \nAs of September 2020, our Common Equity Tier 1\n(CET1) capital ratio was 14.5% under the      \nStandardized Capital Rules and 12.9% under the\nAdvanced Capital Rules.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Nine     \nMonths Ended September 2020 versus September  \n2019. We generated net earnings of $4.95      \nbillion for the first nine months of 2020, a  \ndecrease of 24% compared with $6.55 billion   \nfor the first nine months of 2019. Diluted EPS\nwas $12.65 for the first nine months of 2020, \na decrease of 22% compared with $16.32 for the\nfirst nine months of 2019. Annualized ROE was \n7.6% for the first nine months of 2020,       \ncompared with 10.4% for the first nine months \nof 2019. During the first nine months of 2020,\nwe recorded net provisions for litigation and \nregulatory proceedings of $3.40 billion, which\nreduced diluted EPS by $9.46 and annualized   \nROE by 5.5 percentage points. Net revenues    \nwere $32.82 billion for the first nine months \nof 2020, 23% higher than the first nine months\nof 2019. Net revenues were significantly      \nhigher in both FICC and Equities within Global\nMarkets, driven by strong client activity, and\nin Investment Banking, reflecting             \nsignificantly higher net revenues in both     \nEquity and Debt underwriting. Net revenues in \nConsumer & Wealth Management were higher,     \nreflecting strength in Wealth management and  \ncontinued growth in Consumer banking. These   \nincreases were partially offset by            \nsignificantly lower net revenues in Asset     \nManagement, due to significantly lower net    \nrevenues in both Lending and debt investments \nand Equity investments, which reflected the   \nimpact of a challenging environment earlier   \nthis year. Provision for credit losses was    \n$2.81 billion for the first nine months of    \n2020, compared with $729 million for the first\nnine months of 2019. This increase was        \nprimarily due to significantly higher         \nprovisions related to wholesale loans as a    \nresult of forecasts of expected deterioration \nin the broader economic environment           \n(incorporating the accounting for credit      \nlosses under the Current Expected Credit      \nLosses (CECL) standard) reflecting the impact \nof the global outbreak of the coronavirus     \n(COVID-19)pandemic. In addition, the increase \nin provisions related to wholesale loans      \nreflected the impact of individual impairments\nand ratings downgrades during the first nine  \nmonths of 2020. The first nine months of 2020 \nalso included provisions related to credit    \ncard loans. See Note 3 to the consolidated    \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout ASU No. 2016-13,\u201cFinancial Instruments \u2014\nCredit Losses (Topic 326) \u2014 Measurement of    \nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d      \nOperating expenses were $23.08 billion for the\nfirst nine months of 2020, 31% higher than the\nfirst nine months of 2019, primarily due to   \nsignificantly higher net provisions for       \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings and     \nhigher compensation and benefits expenses     \n(reflecting significantly higher net          \nrevenues). In addition, brokerage, clearing,  \nexchange and distribution fees were higher    \n(reflecting an increase in activity levels),  \nexpenses related to consolidated investments, \nincluding impairments, were significantly     \nhigher and technology expenses were higher.   \nThese increases were partially offset by      \nsignificantly lower travel and entertainment  \nexpenses. Our efficiency ratio (total         \noperating expenses divided by total net       \nrevenues) for the first nine months of 2020   \nwas 70.3%, compared with 66.2% for the first  \nnine months of 2019. Net provisions for       \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings         \nincreased our efficiency ratio for the first  \nnine months of 2020 by 10.3 percentage points.\nDuring the first nine months of 2020, we      \nreturned $3.28 billion of capital to common   \nshareholders, including $1.93 billion of      \ncommon share repurchases, all during the first\nquarter, and $1.35 billion in common stock    \ndividends. Business Environment Although      \nuncertainty about the COVID-19pandemic        \npersisted into the third quarter of 2020, the \noperating environment continued to recover, as\nglobal economic activity rebounded            \nsignificantly during the quarter following a  \nsharp contraction in the second quarter of    \n2020 and market volatility declined modestly. \nThe reopening of businesses and relaxation of \nearlier lockdowns contributed to improving    \neconomic indicators, including higher consumer\nspending and lower U.S. unemployment, and     \nactions from central banks and governments    \nglobally remained accommodative. As a result, \nequity prices increased and credit spreads    \ntightened. During the quarter, the U.S.       \nFederal Reserve affirmed its intentions to    \nkeep short-term rates near zero for several   \nyears, and extra unemployment benefits were   \ntemporarily extended in the U.S. via an       \nexecutive order. Additionally, the Bank of    \nEngland signaled it could use negative rates  \nas a potential policy tool, and the European  \nCentral Bank continued to intervene with      \nmonetary easing measures. Despite broad       \nimprovements in the overall economy since     \nMarch and April, an increase in new           \nCOVID-19cases at the beginning of the fourth  \nquarter of 2020 in certain regions of the     \nworld heightened concerns about the trajectory\nof the coronavirus, the reinstitution of      \nlockdown measures, and the impact on the pace \nof economic recovery going forward.           \nAdditionally, the ongoing discussion around   \nadditional fiscal stimulus in the U.S.        \ncontributed to uncertainty about the economic \noutlook.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Critical \nAccounting Policies Fair Value Fair Value     \nHierarchy. Trading assets and liabilities,    \ncertain investments and loans, and certain    \nother financial assets and liabilities, are   \nincluded in our consolidated balance sheets at\nfair value (i.e., marked-to-market),with      \nrelated gains or losses generally recognized  \nin our consolidated statements of earnings.   \nThe use of fair value to measure financial    \ninstruments is fundamental to our risk        \nmanagement practices and is our most critical \naccounting policy. The fair value of a        \nfinancial instrument is the amount that would \nbe received to sell an asset or paid to       \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. We measure certain financial assets and \nliabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its\nnet exposure to market and/or credit risks).  \nIn determining fair value, the hierarchy under\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles \n(U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to \nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical, unrestricted assets or liabilities \n(level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to   \ninputs other than level 1 inputs that are     \nobservable, either directly or indirectly     \n(level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest        \npriority to inputs that cannot be observed in \nmarket activity (level 3 inputs). In          \nevaluating the significance of a valuation    \ninput, we consider, among other factors, a    \nportfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to that input.  \nAssets and liabilities are classified in their\nentirety based on the lowest level of input   \nthat is significant to their fair value       \nmeasurement. The fair values for substantially\nall of our financial assets and liabilities   \nare based on observable prices and inputs and \nare classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair  \nvalue hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3  \nfinancial assets and liabilities may require  \nappropriate valuation adjustments that a      \nmarket participant would require to arrive at \nfair value for factors, such as counterparty  \nand our credit quality, funding risk, transfer\nrestrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads.\nInstruments classified in level 3 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy are those which require one or\nmore significant inputs that are not          \nobservable. Level 3 financial assets          \nrepresented 2.4% as of September 2020, 2.6% as\nof June 2020 and 2.3% as of December 2019, of \nour total assets. See Notes 4 through 10 to   \nthe consolidated financial statements for     \nfurther information about level 3 financial   \nassets, including changes in level 3 financial\nassets and related fair value measurements.   \nAbsent evidence to the contrary, instruments  \nclassified in level 3 of the fair value       \nhierarchy are initially valued at transaction \nprice, which is considered to be the best     \ninitial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to \nthe transaction date, we use other            \nmethodologies to determine fair value, which  \nvary based on the type of instrument.         \nEstimating the fair value of level 3 financial\ninstruments requires judgments to be made.    \nThese judgments include:                      \n                                              \n       Determining the appropriate valuation  \n  \u2022    methodology and/or model for each      \n       type of level\u00a03 financial instrument;  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determining model inputs based on an   \n       evaluation of all relevant empirical   \n  \u2022    market data, including prices          \n       evidenced by market transactions,      \n       interest rates, credit spreads,        \n       volatilities and correlations; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determining appropriate valuation      \n  \u2022    adjustments, including those related   \n       to illiquidity or counterparty credit  \n       quality.                               \n                                              \nRegardless of the                             \nmethodology, valuation                        \ninputs and assumptions                        \nare only changed when                         \ncorroborated by                               \nsubstantive evidence.                         \nControls Over Valuation                       \nof Financial                                  \nInstruments.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Use of   \nEstimates U.S. GAAP requires us to make       \ncertain estimates and assumptions. In addition\nto the estimates we make in connection with   \nfair value measurements and the allowance for \ncredit losses on loans and lending commitments\nheld for investment and accounted for at      \namortized cost, the use of estimates and      \nassumptions is also important in determining  \ndiscretionary compensation accruals, the      \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and provisions for losses    \nthat may arise from tax audits. A substantial \nportion of our compensation and benefits      \nrepresents discretionary compensation, which  \nis finalized at year-end.We believe the most  \nappropriate way to allocate estimated year-   \nenddiscretionary compensation among interim   \nperiods is in proportion to the net revenues  \nearned in such periods. In addition to the    \nlevel of net revenues, our overall            \ncompensation expense in any given year is also\ninfluenced by, among other factors, overall   \nfinancial performance, prevailing labor       \nmarkets, business mix, the structure of our   \nshare-based compensation programs and the     \nexternal environment. Goodwill is assessed for\nimpairment annually in the fourth quarter or  \nmore frequently if events occur or            \ncircumstances change that indicate an         \nimpairment may exist. When assessing goodwill \nfor impairment, first, a qualitative          \nassessment can be made to determine whether it\nis more likely than not that the estimated    \nfair value of a reporting unit is less than   \nits estimated carrying value. If the results  \nof the qualitative assessment are not         \nconclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is   \nperformed. Alternatively, a quantitative      \ngoodwill test can be performed without        \nperforming a qualitative assessment.          \nEstimating the fair value of our reporting    \nunits requires judgment. Critical inputs to   \nthe fair value estimates include projected    \nearnings and allocated equity. There is       \ninherent uncertainty in the projected         \nearnings. The estimated carrying value of each\nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and represents the       \nestimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity\nrequired to support the activities of the     \nreporting unit under currently applicable     \nregulatory capital requirements. See Note 12  \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about goodwill. If we     \nexperience a prolonged or severe period of    \nweakness in the business environment,         \nfinancial markets, our performance or our     \ncommon stock price, or additional increases in\ncapital requirements, our goodwill could be   \nimpaired in the future. Identifiable          \nintangible assets are tested for impairment   \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances   \nsuggest that an asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s      \ncarrying value may not be fully recoverable.  \nJudgment is required to evaluate whether      \nindications of potential impairment have      \noccurred, and to test intangible assets for   \nimpairment, if required. An impairment is     \nrecognized if the total of the estimated      \nundiscounted cash flows relating to the asset \nor asset group is less than the corresponding \ncarrying value. See Note 12 to the            \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about identifiable intangible     \nassets. We also estimate and provide for      \npotential losses that may arise out of        \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings to the  \nextent that such losses are probable and can  \nbe reasonably estimated. In addition, we      \nestimate the upper end of the range of        \nreasonably possible aggregate loss in excess  \nof the related reserves for litigation and    \nregulatory proceedings where we believe the   \nrisk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18\nand 27 to the consolidated financial          \nstatements for information about certain      \njudicial, litigation and regulatory           \nproceedings. Significant judgment is required \nin making these estimates and our final       \nliabilities may ultimately be materially      \ndifferent. Our total estimated liability in   \nrespect of litigation and regulatory          \nproceedings is determined on a case-by-       \ncasebasis and represents an estimate of       \nprobable losses after considering, among other\nfactors, the progress of each case, proceeding\nor investigation, our experience and the      \nexperience of others in similar cases,        \nproceedings or investigations, and the        \nopinions and views of legal counsel. In       \naccounting for income taxes, we recognize tax \npositions in the financial statements only    \nwhen it is more likely than not that the      \nposition will be sustained on examination by  \nthe relevant taxing authority based on the    \ntechnical merits of the position.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nEnvironment. Despite the continued uncertainty\nfrom the COVID-19pandemic during the third    \nquarter of 2020, continued improvements in the\nbroader economic environment from the earlier \nimpact of the COVID-19pandemic positively     \nimpacted financial markets, which along with  \nimproving sentiment on the pace of the        \neconomic recovery, contributed to generally   \nhigher global equity prices and fixed income  \nasset prices compared with the end of the     \nsecond quarter of 2020. Additionally, the     \ncontinued benefit of monetary and fiscal      \nsupport from central banks and governments    \nglobally and elevated market volatility       \nimpacted market-making activities. Investment \nbanking activities benefitted from high levels\nof industry-wide underwriting volumes, while  \nindustry-wide completed mergers and           \nacquisitions volumes significantly decreased, \nreflecting the impact of the COVID-19pandemic \non announcements in the first half of 2020. If\nthe COVID-19 pandemic persists, it may lead to\na decline in market-making activity levels, a \ncontinued decline in industry-wide completed  \nmergers and acquisitions volumes, or a decline\nin industry-wide underwriting volumes, and    \ndeclines in global equity markets or widening \nof credit spreads. As a result, net revenues  \nand the provision for credit losses would     \nlikely be negatively impacted. See \u201cSegment   \nOperating Results\u201d for information about the  \noperating environment and material trends and \nuncertainties that may impact our results of  \noperations. Three Months Ended September 2020 \nversus September 2019 Net revenues in the     \nconsolidated statements of earnings were      \n$10.78 billion for the third quarter of 2020, \n30% higher than the third quarter of 2019,    \nprimarily reflecting significantly higher     \nother principal transactions, market making   \nand investment banking revenues, and higher   \ninvestment management revenues. Non-          \nInterestRevenues. Investment banking revenues \nin the consolidated statements of earnings    \nwere $1.93 billion for the third quarter of   \n2020, 22% higher than the third quarter of    \n2019, due to significantly higher revenues in \nequity underwriting, primarily reflecting a   \nsignificant increase in industry-wide initial \npublic offerings, and higher revenues in debt \nunderwriting, driven by asset-backed and      \ninvestment-grade activity. These increases    \nwere partially offset by significantly lower  \nrevenues in financial advisory, reflecting a  \ndecrease in industry-wide completed mergers   \nand acquisitions transactions. Investment     \nmanagement revenues in the consolidated       \nstatements of earnings were $1.69 billion for \nthe third quarter of 2020, 8% higher than the \nthird quarter of 2019, due to higher          \nmanagement and other fees, reflecting the     \nimpact of higher average assets under         \nsupervision (AUS), partially offset by a lower\naverage effective management fee due to shifts\nin the mix of client assets and strategies.   \nCommissions and fees in the consolidated      \nstatements of earnings were $804 million for  \nthe third quarter of 2020, 7% higher than the \nthird quarter of 2019. Market making revenues \nin the consolidated statements of earnings    \nwere $3.33 billion for the third quarter of   \n2020, 34% higher than the third quarter of    \n2019, primarily due to significantly higher   \nrevenues in equity products (particularly in  \nderivatives), commodities, currencies and     \ncredit products and higher revenues in        \ninterest rate products. Other principal       \ntransactions revenues in the consolidated     \nstatements of earnings were $1.94 billion for \nthe third quarter of 2020, more than double   \ncompared with the third quarter of 2019,      \nreflecting net gains from investments in      \npublic equities in the third quarter of 2020  \ncompared with net losses in the third quarter \nof 2019 and significantly higher net gains    \nfrom debt investments, reflecting tighter     \ncorporate credit spreads during the quarter.  \nThese increases were partially offset by      \nsignificantly lower net gains from investments\nin private equities and lower results for     \nrelationship lending activities, including the\nimpact of changes in credit spreads on hedges.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income in   \nthe consolidated statements of earnings was   \n$1.08 billion for the third quarter of 2020,  \n8% higher than the third quarter of 2019,     \nreflecting a decrease in interest expense     \nprimarily related to other interest-bearing   \nliabilities, collateralized financings and    \ndeposits, each reflecting the impact of lower \ninterest rates, partially offset by the impact\nof higher average balances for deposits.

Our    \nefficiency ratio (total operating expenses    \ndivided by total net revenues) for the third  \nquarter of 2020 was 57.5%, compared with 67.5%\nfor the third quarter of 2019. The increase in\noperating expenses compared with the third    \nquarter of 2019 was due to higher compensation\nand benefits expenses (reflecting             \nsignificantly higher net revenues) and higher \nnon-compensationexpenses. The increase in non-\ncompensationexpenses reflected significantly  \nhigher net provisions for litigation and      \nregulatory proceedings, and higher technology \nexpenses and brokerage, clearing, exchange and\ndistribution fees, partially offset by lower  \ntravel and entertainment expenses (included in\nmarket development expenses), professional    \nfees and occupancy-related expenses. Net      \nprovisions for litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings for the third quarter of 2020 were\n$256 million compared with $47 million for the\nthird quarter of 2019.

Net provisions for \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings         \nincreased our efficiency ratio for the first  \nnine months of 2020 by 10.3 percentage points.\nThe increase in operating expenses compared   \nwith the first nine months of 2019 was        \nprimarily due to significantly higher net     \nprovisions for litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings and higher compensation and       \nbenefits expenses (reflecting significantly   \nhigher net revenues). In addition, brokerage, \nclearing, exchange and distribution fees were \nhigher (reflecting an increase in activity    \nlevels), expenses related to consolidated     \ninvestments, including impairments, were      \nsignificantly higher (increase was primarily  \nin depreciation and amortization and occupancy\nexpenses), and technology expenses were       \nhigher. These increases were partially offset \nby significantly lower travel and             \nentertainment expenses (included in market    \ndevelopment expenses). Net provisions for     \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings for the \nfirst nine months of 2020 were $3.40 billion  \ncompared with $150 million for the first nine \nmonths of 2019. Headcount increased 7%        \ncompared with December 2019, reflecting       \ninvestments in new business initiatives and an\nincrease in technology professionals.         \n                                              \n  107    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form\u00a0   \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nEnvironment. During the third quarter of 2020,\nthe operating environment for Investment      \nBanking continued to reflect high levels of   \nunderwriting activity, as industry-wide       \nvolumes for initial public offerings were     \nstrong and high-yield debt offerings remained \nactive, while investment-grade volumes        \nnormalized following the strong pace of       \nactivity during the first half of 2020.       \nCorporate clients continued to pay down funds \nborrowed earlier in the year under revolving  \nlines of credit, reflecting improving         \nmacroeconomic conditions and companies\u2019       \nability to access capital markets, while      \ncorporate credit spreads tightened during the \nquarter. In mergers and acquisitions activity,\nindustry-wide announced volumes increased     \nsignificantly, following a slowdown during the\nfirst half of 2020 that resulted from the     \nuncertainty caused by the COVID-19pandemic.   \nThe impact from the pandemic to announcements \nearlier in the year continued to weigh on     \nindustry-wide completed mergers and           \nacquisitions volumes, which significantly     \ndecreased compared with the second quarter of \n2020. In the future, if industry-wide         \nannounced mergers and acquisitions volumes    \ndecline, or if industry-wide completed mergers\nand acquisitions volumes continue to decline, \nor if industry-wide equity and debt           \nunderwriting volumes decline, or credit       \nspreads related to hedges on our relationship \nlending portfolio continue to tighten, net    \nrevenues in Investment Banking would likely be\nnegatively impacted. In addition, a           \ndeterioration in the creditworthiness of      \nborrowers would negatively impact the         \nprovision for credit losses. Three Months     \nEnded September 2020 versus September 2019.   \nNet revenues in Investment Banking were $1.97 \nbillion for the third quarter of 2020, 7%     \nhigher than the third quarter of 2019,        \nreflecting significantly higher net revenues  \nin Underwriting, partially offset by          \nsignificantly lower net revenues in Corporate \nlending and Financial advisory. The increase  \nin Underwriting net revenues was due to       \nsignificantly higher net revenues in Equity   \nunderwriting, primarily reflecting a          \nsignificant increase in industry-wide initial \npublic offerings, and higher net revenues in  \nDebt underwriting, driven by asset-backed and \ninvestment-grade activity. The decrease in    \nCorporate lending net revenues primarily      \nreflected lower results for relationship      \nlending activities, including the impact of   \nchanges in credit spreads on hedges. The third\nquarter of 2020 included $115 million of net  \nlosses related to these hedges. The decrease  \nin Financial advisory net revenues reflected a\ndecrease in industry-wide completed mergers   \nand acquisitions transactions. Provision for  \ncredit losses was $171 million for the third  \nquarter of 2020, 88% higher than the third    \nquarter of 2019, reflecting higher impairments\nrelated to middle-market and relationship     \nlending, partially offset by reserve          \nreductions from paydowns on corporate lines of\ncredit. Operating expenses were $1.07 billion \nfor the third quarter of 2020, 10% higher than\nthe third quarter of 2019, due to higher net  \nprovisions for litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings. Pre-taxearnings were $731 million\nfor the third quarter of 2020, 6% lower than  \nthe third quarter of 2019. As of September    \n2020, our investment banking transaction      \nbacklog increased significantly compared with \nJune 2020, due to significantly higher        \nestimated net revenues across potential       \nadvisory transactions, potential equity       \nunderwriting transactions (primarily from     \ninitial public offerings), and potential debt \nunderwriting transactions (particularly from  \nasset-backed and leveraged finance            \ntransactions). Our backlog represents an      \nestimate of our net revenues from future      \ntransactions where we believe that future     \nrevenue realization is more likely than not.  \nWe believe changes in our backlog may be a    \nuseful indicator of client activity levels    \nwhich, over the long term, impact our net     \nrevenues. However, the time frame for         \ncompletion and corresponding revenue          \nrecognition of transactions in our backlog    \nvaries based on the nature of the assignment, \nas certain transactions may remain in our     \nbacklog for longer periods of time, which     \ncould occur in light of the impact of the     \nCOVID-19pandemic on mergers and acquisitions. \nIn addition, our backlog is subject to certain\nlimitations, such as assumptions about the    \nlikelihood that individual client transactions\nwill occur in the future. Transactions may be \ncancelled or modified, and transactions not   \nincluded in the estimate may also occur,      \nincluding underwriting transactions for which \nthe time frame from discussion to completion  \nhas shortened in the current environment. Nine\nMonths Ended September 2020 versus September  \n2019. Net revenues in Investment Banking were \n$6.81 billion for the first nine months of    \n2020, 23% higher than the first nine months of\n2019, reflecting significantly higher net     \nrevenues in Underwriting, partially offset by \nlower net revenues in Financial advisory and  \nsignificantly lower net revenues in Corporate \nlending. The increase in Underwriting net     \nrevenues was due to significantly higher net  \nrevenues in both Equity and Debt underwriting,\nreflecting a significant increase in industry-\nwide volumes. The decrease in Financial       \nadvisory net revenues reflected a decrease in \nindustry-wide completed transactions. The     \ndecrease in Corporate lending net revenues was\ndue to changes in the fair value of corporate \nloans, including net losses in the first nine \nmonths of 2020 compared with net gains in the \nfirst nine months of 2019, and significantly  \nlower net interest income, partially offset by\nthe impact of changes in credit spreads on    \nhedges related to relationship lending        \nactivities in the prior year period.          \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs September\u00a02020\u00a0Form      110  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Our      \ncapital planning process incorporates an      \ninternal capital adequacy assessment with the \nobjective of ensuring that we are             \nappropriately capitalized relative to the     \nrisks in our businesses. We incorporate stress\nscenarios into our capital planning process   \nwith a goal of holding sufficient capital to  \nensure we remain adequately capitalized after \nexperiencing a severe stress event. Our       \nassessment of capital adequacy is viewed in   \ntandem with our assessment of liquidity       \nadequacy and is integrated into our overall   \nrisk management structure, governance and     \npolicy framework. Our stress tests incorporate\nour internally designed stress scenarios,     \nincluding our internally developed severely   \nadverse scenario, and those required under    \nCCAR and DFAST, and are designed to capture   \nour specific vulnerabilities and risks. We    \nprovide further information about our stress  \ntest processes and a summary of the results on\nour website as described in \u201cAvailable        \nInformation.\u201d As required by the FRB\u2019s CCAR   \nrules, we submit an annual capital plan for   \nreview by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB\u2019s   \nreview is to ensure that we have a robust,    \nforward-looking capital planning process that \naccounts for our unique risks and that permits\ncontinued operation during times of economic  \nand financial stress. We submitted our 2020   \nCCAR capital plan in April 2020 and published \na summary of our annual DFAST results in June \n2020. See \u201cAvailable Information.\u201d The FRB    \nevaluates us based, in part, on whether we    \nhave the capital necessary to continue        \noperating under the baseline and severely     \nadverse scenarios provided by the FRB and     \nthose developed internally. This evaluation   \nalso takes into account our process for       \nidentifying risk, our controls and governance \nfor capital planning, and our guidelines for  \nmaking capital planning decisions. In         \naddition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make  \ncapital distributions (i.e., dividend payments\nand repurchases or redemptions of stock,      \nsubordinated debt or other capital securities)\nand issue capital, across the range of        \nmacroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific     \nassumptions. The FRB determines the stressed  \ncapital buffer (SCB) applicable to us based on\nits own annual stress test. The SCB under the \nStandardized approach is calculated as (i) the\ndifference between our starting and minimum   \nprojected CET1 capital ratios under the       \nsupervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii)\nour planned common stock dividends for each of\nthe fourth through seventh quarters of the    \nplanning horizon, expressed as a percentage of\nrisk-weighted assets (RWAs). With respect to  \nour 2020 CCAR submission, the FRB notified us \nthat our SCB beginning on October 1, 2020 is  \n6.6%, bringing our Standardized CET1 capital  \nratio requirement to 13.6%. In light of the   \nimpact of the COVID-19pandemic on the economy,\nthe FRB required all large bank holding       \ncompanies (BHCs) to suspend stock repurchases \nthrough the fourth quarter of 2020 and not to \nincrease common stock dividends or pay common \nstock dividends in excess of their average net\nincome over the past four quarters. The FRB is\nalso requiring large BHCs to resubmit their   \ncapital plans in November 2020 under the      \nupdated baseline and severely adverse         \nscenarios, and a new alternative severe       \nscenario. The FRB will use this submission to \nconduct a second round of stress tests to     \nfurther evaluate the resiliency of BHCs. The  \nFRB will release firm-specific results by the \nend of the year. We plan to maintain both     \ncommon and preferred dividends, while         \ncomplying with the SCB rule. In addition, we  \nwill continue deploying capital to our        \nbusinesses where returns are accretive and    \notherwise return it to our shareholders as    \npermitted by the FRB. GS Bank USA has its own \ncapital planning process, but was not required\nto conduct its annual stress test in 2020.    \nBased on growth in GS Bank USA\u2019s average      \nbalance sheet, it will be subject to this     \nrequirement beginning in 2022. Goldman Sachs  \nInternational (GSI) and GSIB also have their  \nown capital planning and stress testing       \nprocess, which incorporates internally        \ndesigned stress tests developed in accordance \nwith the guidelines of the Prudential         \nRegulation Authority (PRA). Contingency       \nCapital Plan. As part of our comprehensive    \ncapital management policy, we maintain a      \ncontingency capital plan. Our contingency     \ncapital plan provides a framework for         \nanalyzing and responding to a perceived or    \nactual capital deficiency, including, but not \nlimited to, identification of drivers of a    \ncapital deficiency, as well as mitigants and  \npotential actions. It outlines the appropriate\ncommunication procedures to follow during a   \ncrisis period, including internal             \ndissemination of information, as well as      \ntimely communication with external            \nstakeholders. Capital Attribution. We assess  \neach of our businesses\u2019 capital usage based on\nour internal assessment of risks, which       \nincorporates an attribution of all of our     \nrelevant regulatory capital requirements.     \nThese regulatory capital requirements are     \nallocated using our attributed equity         \nframework, which takes into consideration our \nmost binding capital constraints. Our most    \nbinding capital constraint is based on the    \nresults of the FRB\u2019s annual stress test       \nscenarios which include the Standardized risk-\nbased capital and leverage ratios. See        \n\u201cSegment Assets and Operating Results \u2014       \nSegment Operating Results\u201d for information    \nabout our attributed equity by segment.       \n                                              \n  125    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form\u00a0   \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Share    \nRepurchase Program. We use our share          \nrepurchase program to help maintain the       \nappropriate level of common equity. The       \nrepurchase program is effected primarily      \nthrough regular open-market purchases (which  \nmay include repurchase plans designed to      \ncomply with Rule 10b5-1and accelerated share  \nrepurchases), the amounts and timing of which \nare determined primarily by our current and   \nprojected capital position and our capital    \nplan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The\namounts and timing of the repurchases may also\nbe influenced by general market conditions and\nthe prevailing price and trading volumes of   \nour common stock. As of September 2020, the   \nremaining share authorization under our       \nexisting repurchase program was 49.7 million  \nshares.

Resolution Capital Models. In        \nconnection with our resolution planning       \nefforts, we have established a Resolution     \nCapital Adequacy and Positioning framework,   \nwhich is designed to ensure that our major    \nsubsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co.\nLLC (GS&Co.), GSI, GSIB, Goldman Sachs Japan  \nCo., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset        \nManagement, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Asset      \nManagement International) have access to      \nsufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the    \nform of equity, subordinated debt and         \nunsecured senior debt) so that they are able  \nto wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy\nfiling in accordance with our preferred       \nresolution strategy. In addition, we have     \nestablished a triggers and alerts framework,  \nwhich is designed to provide the Board of     \nDirectors of Group Inc. (Board) with          \ninformation needed to make an informed        \ndecision on whether and when to commence      \nbankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc. Rating  \nAgency Guidelines The credit rating agencies  \nassign credit ratings to the obligations of   \nGroup Inc., which directly issues or          \nguarantees substantially all of our senior    \nunsecured debt obligations. GS&Co. and GSI    \nhave been assigned long- and short-term issuer\nratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS \nBank USA and GSIB have also been assigned     \nlong- and short-term issuer ratings, as well  \nas ratings on their long- and short-term bank \ndeposits. In addition, credit rating agencies \nhave assigned ratings to debt obligations of  \ncertain other subsidiaries of Group Inc. The  \nlevel and composition of our equity capital   \nare among the many factors considered in      \ndetermining our credit ratings. Each agency   \nhas its own definition of eligible capital and\nmethodology for evaluating capital adequacy,  \nand assessments are generally based on a      \ncombination of factors rather than a single   \ncalculation. See \u201cRisk Management \u2014 Liquidity \nRisk Management \u2014 Credit Ratings\u201d for further \ninformation about credit ratings of Group     \nInc., GS Bank USA, GSIB, GS&Co. and GSI.      \nConsolidated Regulatory Capital We are subject\nto consolidated regulatory capital            \nrequirements which are calculated in          \naccordance with the regulations of the FRB    \n(Capital Framework). Under the Capital        \nFramework, we are an \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d      \nbanking organization and have been designated \nas a global systemically important bank       \n(G-SIB). The capital requirements calculated  \nin accordance with the Capital Framework      \ninclude the risk-based capital buffers and    \nG-SIBsurcharge. The risk-based capital        \nbuffers, applicable to us as of September     \n2020, include the capital conservation buffer \nof 2.5% and the countercyclical capital       \nbuffer, which the FRB has set to zero percent.\nBeginning on October 1, 2020, the SCB replaced\nthe capital conservation buffer under the     \nStandardized Capital Rules. See \u201cEquity       \nCapital Management \u2013 Capital Planning and     \nStress Testing Process\u201d for further           \ninformation about our applicable SCB. In      \naddition, the G-SIBsurcharge applicable to us \nfor 2020 is 2.5% based on 2018 financial data \nand 2.5% for 2021 based on 2019 financial     \ndata. Based on financial data for the nine    \nmonths ended September 2020, our current      \nestimate is that we are above the threshold   \nfor the 3.0% G-SIBsurcharge. We expect that   \nour G-SIBsurcharge may remain above the 3%    \nthreshold over the next three years. This     \nincrease would be effective on January 1 of   \nthe year that is one full calendar year after \nthe increased G-SIBsurcharge is finalized. The\nG-SIBsurcharge and countercyclical buffer in  \nthe future may differ due to additional       \nguidance from our regulators and/or positional\nchanges. Our target Standardized CET1 capital \nratio over the medium term is between 13.0%   \nand 13.5% (including management buffers)based \nupon the execution of our previously announced\nstrategic initiatives and achievement of      \ncapital efficiencies.

Regulations have been adopted or   \nare being considered by regulators and policy \nmakers worldwide. Given that many of the new  \nand proposed rules are highly complex, the    \nfull impact of regulatory reform will not be  \nknown until the rules are implemented and     \nmarket practices develop under the final      \nregulations. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in   \nPart I, Item 1 of the 2019 Form 10-Kfor       \nfurther information about the laws, rules and \nregulations and proposed laws, rules and      \nregulations that apply to us and our          \noperations. Other Matters Brexit. In March    \n2017, the U.K. government commenced the formal\nproceedings to withdraw from the E.U. The E.U.\nand the U.K. agreed to a withdrawal agreement \n(the Withdrawal Agreement), which became      \neffective on January 31, 2020. The transition \nperiod under the Withdrawal Agreement will    \nlast until the end of December 2020 to allow  \nthe two sides to negotiate a future trade     \nagreement. During the transition period, the  \nU.K. will be treated as if it were a member   \nstate of the E.U. and therefore the existing  \narrangements between the U.K. and the E.U.    \nwill not change. The Withdrawal Agreement     \nprovides for the possibility of an extension  \nof the transition period for either one or two\nmore years. However, the U.K. formally        \nconfirmed to the E.U. in June 2020 that it    \nwill not seek an extension period beyond      \nDecember 31, 2020. The E.U. and the U.K. have \nnot yet completed their assessments of        \nequivalence, based upon the existing          \nnon-E.U.country equivalence regimes and there \nis increasing uncertainty as to the likelihood\nof those assessments being in place by the end\nof the transition period. We are monitoring   \nthe ongoing development related to Brexit and \ncontinue to prepare for a scenario where the  \nU.K. financial services firms will lose access\nto E.U. markets on December 31, 2020 (a \u201chard\u201d\nBrexit) while ensuring we remain flexible and \nwell positioned to allow our clients to       \nbenefit from any more favorable scenarios. Our\nplanning also recognizes that after the end of\nthe transition period, we can rely on a degree\nof continuing access for our U.K. entities    \npursuant to national cross-border access      \nregimes in certain jurisdictions (for example,\nbased on specific licenses or exemptions). See\n\u201cRegulatory Matters and Other Developments \u2014  \nOther Developments\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the \n2019 Form 10-Kfor further information about   \nour plan to manage a hard Brexit scenario.    \nReplacement of Interbank Offered Rates        \n(IBORs), including LIBOR. Central banks and   \nregulators in a number of major jurisdictions \n(for example, U.S., U.K., E.U., Switzerland   \nand Japan) have convened working groups to    \nfind, and implement the transition to,        \nsuitable replacements for IBORs. The FCA,     \nwhich regulates LIBOR, has announced that it  \nwill not compel panel banks to contribute to  \nLIBOR after 2021. In the first quarter of     \n2020, the FCA, alongside the Bank of England  \nand the members of the Working Group on       \nSterling Risk-Free Reference Rates, issued a  \nstatement reaffirming that firms cannot rely  \non LIBOR being published after 2021. In       \nOctober 2020, the International Swaps and     \nDerivatives Association (ISDA) launched the   \nIBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which will become    \neffective in January 2021, and will provide   \nderivatives market participants with new      \nfallbacks for legacy and new derivatives      \ncontracts. Both counterparties will have to   \nadhere to the Fallbacks Protocol or engage in \nbilateral amendments for the terms to be      \neffective for derivative contracts. We have   \nadhered to the Fallbacks Protocol for our     \nderivative contracts. We continue to make     \nprogress on our LIBOR transition program in   \nline with this deadline. We have created a    \nprogram that focuses on achieving an orderly  \ntransition from IBORs to alternative risk-free\nreference rates for us and our clients. As    \npart of this transition, we continue to       \nactively engage with our regulators and       \nclients, as well as participate in central    \nbank and sector working groups. We have issued\ndebt and deposits linked to the Secured       \nOvernight Financing Rate (SOFR) and Sterling  \nOvernight Index Average (SONIA) and have      \nexecuted SOFR- and SONIA-based derivative     \ncontracts to make markets and facilitate      \nclient activities. Where possible, we continue\nto execute transactions in the market to      \nreduce our LIBOR exposures arising from hedges\nto our fixed-rate debt issuances and replace  \nwith alternative risk-free reference rates    \nexposures.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Impact of\nCOVID-19Pandemic. The persistence of the      \nCOVID-19pandemic poses ongoing challenges for \nthe global economy. While economic activity   \nhas generally accelerated from earlier in the \nyear when widespread lockdown measures were in\nplace, progress has been uneven across        \ncountries and the sustainability of global    \neconomic recovery is vulnerable to the risk of\na resurgence in infections. Governments and   \ncentral banks around the world have remained  \nproactive in responding to the crisis through \nunprecedented accommodative monetary policy   \nand fiscal stimulus. We have continued to     \nsuccessfully execute on our Business          \nContinuity Planning (BCP) strategy since      \ninitially activating it in the first quarter  \nof 2020 in response to the emergence of the   \nCOVID-19pandemic. Our priority has been to    \nsafeguard our employees and to seek to ensure \ncontinuity of business operations on behalf of\nour clients. Our business continuity response \nto the COVID-19pandemic is managed by a       \ncentral team, which is led by our chief       \nadministrative officer and chief medical      \nofficer, and includes senior management within\nRisk and the chief operating officers across  \nall regions and businesses. As a result of our\nBCP strategy, the majority of our employees   \nworked remotely during the third quarter of   \n2020, as in the second quarter of 2020. We    \nhave established policies and protocols that  \nwill enable a phased return to office, taking \ninto account the readiness of people,         \ncommunities and facilities. As communities    \nwhere we operate began to reopen, we took the \nnecessary steps to enable employees to start  \nto return to the office in a safe manner. We  \nare in constant dialogue with key stakeholders\nto assess health and safety conditions across \nall of our office locations and to implement  \nprocedures necessary to protect the well-being\nof employees, such as controls around building\naccess, strict physical distancing measures   \nand enhanced cleaning regimes. We have        \ncontinued to make measured progress in        \nreturning to the office. As of mid-           \nOctober,approximately 60% of employees in Hong\nKong and Tokyo were working in the office,    \napproximately 50% in most of Europe,          \napproximately 30% in the U.K. and             \napproximately 20% in New York. Progress going \nforward for each of our offices around the    \nworld will be dictated by the circumstances in\neach region. Our systems and infrastructure   \nhave continued to support all of our          \nactivities. We maintained regular and active  \ncommunication among senior management, the    \nrest of our employees and the Board. Decision-\nmaking continues to occur through a variety of\nsenior management meetings. Since the         \nbeginning of the COVID-19pandemic, our        \nManagement Committee and other senior leaders \nhave met regularly and our executive officers \nhave provided regular and enhanced            \ncommunications to promote connectivity with   \nour clients and employees worldwide.          \nFurthermore, we have ongoing dialogues with   \nvendors intended to ensure that they continue \nto meet our criteria for business continuity. \nOur liquidity position during the third       \nquarter of 2020 remained strong, as our GCLA  \naveraged $302 billion for the quarter. We     \ncontinue to access our traditional funding    \nsources in the normal course and service our  \ndebt and other obligations on a timely basis. \nOur CET1 capital ratios under the Standardized\napproach improved to 14.5% as of the end of   \nthe third quarter of 2020, up 120 basis points\ncompared with the second quarter of 2020, as  \nwe effectively managed our capital while      \ncontinuing to support our clients. We         \nsuspended stock repurchases during the first  \nquarter of 2020 and through the third quarter \nof 2020. Consistent with the FRB\u2019s requirement\nfor all large BHCs, we have extended the      \nsuspension of stock repurchases through the   \nfourth quarter of 2020. See \u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources,\u201d \u201cEquity Capital Management  \nand Regulatory Capital\u201d and \u201cLiquidity Risk   \nManagement\u201d for further information. As a     \nresult of the COVID-19pandemic, we have had to\napply a greater degree of judgment in making  \ncertain accounting estimates and assumptions. \nThe ongoing uncertainty regarding future      \ndevelopments associated with the              \nCOVID-19pandemic and the path of the global   \neconomy creates added challenges and          \ncomplexities in determining the allowance for \ncredit losses, as the process is inherently   \njudgmental and requires estimation of expected\ncredit losses based on economic forecasts and \nother considerations. The uncertainty         \nregarding the severity and duration of the    \nfuture economic impacts of the                \nCOVID-19pandemic also affects the estimation  \nof the fair value for less liquid financial   \ninstruments that lack price transparency,     \nwhere valuation involves judgment regarding   \nestimated future cash flows or other          \nsignificant unobservable inputs. Although     \nconditions in financial markets normalized    \nfollowing a period of severe disruption early \nin the pandemic, determining the valuation for\ncertain Level 3 instruments remains           \nchallenging in the current environment. See   \nNote 9 to the consolidated financial          \nstatements for further information about our  \nallowance for credit losses and Note 4 to the \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about fair value measurements.    \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs September\u00a02020\u00a0Form      130  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis As a     \nresult of the ongoing uncertainty in the      \nmacroeconomic environment since we last       \nperformed a quantitative goodwill impairment  \ntest in the fourth quarter of 2019, we        \nassessed goodwill for impairment as of        \nSeptember 2020 and determined that it was not \nimpaired. See Note 12 to the consolidated     \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout goodwill. Volatility remains at elevated\nlevels and continues to be a driver of client \ntrading activity. We have remained committed  \nto serving the needs of our clients by        \ndeploying our balance sheet in a disciplined  \nmanner to intermediate risk. Our average daily\nValue-at-Risk(VaR) for the third quarter of   \n2020 was $91 million, $33 million higher than \nthe third quarter of 2019. We have maintained \nour proactive approach to managing market risk\nlevels, which entails ongoing review and      \nmonitoring of exposures and focusing on ways  \nto mitigate risk. With respect to credit risk,\nthe gradual reopening of global economies and \nongoing actions taken by governments have     \naided borrowers that have faced significant   \ndisruptions due to the COVID-19pandemic, such \nas companies in the oil and gas, gaming and   \nlodging, and airlines industries, but these   \nborrowers still face substantial pressure in  \ntrying to manage through the crisis. In       \nrelationship lending, drawdowns on credit     \nfacilities are returning to more normalized   \nlevels, with net paydowns of approximately $7 \nbillion occurring during the third quarter of \n2020. However, credit risk, in general,       \nremains elevated across the banking industry. \nThroughout this crisis, we have remained      \nhighly focused on monitoring of credit        \nexposures and management of margin calls and  \ndisputes. Our risk positions remained         \nbalanced, controlled and adequately           \nprovisioned for, both in terms of counterparty\nrisk and sector exposure. See \u201cMarket Risk    \nManagement\u201d and \u201cCredit Risk Management\u201d for  \nfurther information. Our actions in response  \nto the COVID-19pandemic have included granting\nforbearance to certain corporate and other    \nborrowers who have made requests to defer     \npayments. We had approximately $960 million of\ncorporate loans and approximately $290 million\nof commercial real estate loans under         \nforbearance as of September 2020. We have     \ncontinued to provide relief to consumers      \nthrough programs to help them manage the      \nfinancial challenges that they face as a      \nresult of the COVID-19pandemic. The           \naccommodations under these programs include   \nproviding borrowers of installment and credit \ncard loans the ability to modify or defer     \npayments without incurring interest charges   \nand permitting Marcus depositors to access    \ncertificates of deposit early without a       \npenalty. As of September 2020, installment and\ncredit card loans with a gross carrying value \nof approximately $300 million were enrolled in\nsuch programs. In aggregate, loans under      \nforbearance or relief programs represented    \napproximately 1% of total loans. The          \nCOVID-19pandemic has created significant      \nuncertainty regarding the operating           \nenvironment for the future, as the duration   \nand course of the pandemic cannot be predicted\nat this time. A sustained period of weak      \neconomic conditions as a result of the        \npandemic would be detrimental to our          \nbusinesses as it would negatively affect      \nfactors that are important to our operating   \nperformance, such as the level of client      \nactivity, creditworthiness of counterparties  \nand borrowers, and the amount of our AUS. We  \nare monitoring the ongoing developments       \nrelated to the COVID-19pandemic and will take \nfurther action as may be required by          \ngovernment authorities or that we determine   \nare in the best interests of our employees,   \nclients and counterparties.

Overview and        \nStructure of Risk Management Overview We      \nbelieve that effective risk management is     \ncritical to our success. Accordingly, we have \nestablished an enterprise risk management     \nframework that employs a comprehensive,       \nintegrated approach to risk management, and is\ndesigned to enable comprehensive risk         \nmanagement processes through which we         \nidentify, assess, monitor and manage the risks\nwe assume in conducting our activities. Our   \nrisk management structure is built around     \nthree core components: governance, processes  \nand people. Governance. Risk management       \ngovernance starts with the Board, which both  \ndirectly and through its committees, including\nits Risk Committee, oversees our risk         \nmanagement policies and practices implemented \nthrough the enterprise risk management        \nframework. The Board is also responsible for  \nthe annual review and approval of our risk    \nappetite statement. The risk appetite         \nstatement describes the levels and types of   \nrisk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in \norder to achieve our objectives included in   \nour strategic business plan, while remaining  \nin compliance with regulatory requirements.   \nThe Board reviews our strategic business plan \nand is ultimately responsible for overseeing  \nand providing direction about our strategy and\nrisk appetite.                                \n                                              \n  133    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form\u00a0   \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Because we maintain a highly   \n       liquid balance sheet, the holding      \n       period of certain of our assets may    \n       be materially shorter than their       \n       contractual maturity dates.            \n                                              \nOur goal is to ensure                         \nthat we maintain                              \nsufficient liquidity                          \nto fund our assets and                        \nmeet our contractual                          \nand contingent                                \nobligations in normal                         \ntimes, as well as                             \nduring periods of                             \nmarket stress.

Although we have   \n  \u2022    access to various central bank         \n       funding programs, we do not assume     \n       reliance on additional sources of      \n       funding in a liquidity crisis; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n       A combination of contractual           \n       outflows, such as upcoming maturities  \n       of unsecured debt, and contingent      \n       outflows, including, but not limited   \n       to, the withdrawal of customer credit  \n       balances in our prime brokerage        \n  \u2022    business, increase in variation        \n       margin requirements due to adverse     \n       changes in the value of our            \n       exchange-traded                        \n       andOTC-clearedderivatives, and         \n       withdrawals of deposits that have no   \n       contractual maturity.                  \n                                              \nIntraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday        \nLiquidity Model measures our intraday         \nliquidity needs using a scenario analysis     \ncharacterized by the same qualitative elements\nas our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model   \nassesses the risk of increased intraday       \nliquidity requirements during a scenario where\naccess to sources of intraday liquidity may   \nbecome constrained. Long-Term Stress Testing. \nWe utilize longer-term stress tests to take a \nforward view on our liquidity position through\nprolonged stress periods in which we          \nexperience a severe liquidity stress and      \nrecover in an environment that continues to be\nchallenging. We are focused on ensuring       \nconservative asset-liability management to    \nprepare for a prolonged period of potential   \nstress, seeking to maintain a diversified     \nfunding profile with an appropriate tenor,    \ntaking into consideration the characteristics \nand liquidity profile of our assets.          \nResolution Liquidity Models. In connection    \nwith our resolution planning efforts, we have \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy \nand Positioning framework, which estimates    \nliquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a\nstressed environment. The liquidity needs are \nmeasured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow  \nassumptions and include certain additional    \ninter-affiliate exposures. We have also       \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Execution\nNeed framework, which measures the liquidity  \nneeds of our major subsidiaries to stabilize  \nand wind-down following a Group Inc.          \nbankruptcy filing in accordance with our      \npreferred resolution strategy. In addition, we\nhave established a triggers and alerts        \nframework, which is designed to provide the   \nBoard with information needed to make an      \ninformed decision on whether and when to      \ncommence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\nLimits We use liquidity risk limits at various\nlevels and across liquidity risk types to     \nmanage the size of our liquidity exposures.   \nLimits are measured relative to acceptable    \nlevels of risk given our liquidity risk       \ntolerance. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for information about the limit   \napproval process. Limits are monitored by     \nTreasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is\nresponsible for identifying and escalating to \nsenior management and/or the appropriate risk \ncommittee, on a timely basis, instances where \nlimits have been exceeded.                    \n                                              \n  141    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form\u00a0   \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow   \nand Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a    \nrequirement for Group Inc., as well as a      \nstandalone requirement for each of our major  \nbroker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding  \nIHC is required to provide the necessary      \nliquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary   \ncourse of business, and is also obligated to  \nprovide capital and liquidity support to major\nsubsidiaries in the event of our material     \nfinancial distress or failure. Liquidity held \ndirectly in each of our major broker-dealer   \nand bank subsidiaries is intended for use only\nby that subsidiary to meet its liquidity      \nrequirements and is assumed not to be         \navailable to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless \n(i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no\nadditional regulatory, tax or other           \nrestrictions. In addition, the Modeled        \nLiquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model\nalso incorporate a broader assessment of      \nstandalone liquidity requirements for other   \nsubsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA\ndirectly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to      \nsupport such requirements. Other Unencumbered \nAssets. In addition to our GCLA, we have a    \nsignificant amount of other unencumbered cash \nand financial instruments, including other    \ngovernment obligations, high-grade money      \nmarket securities, corporate obligations,     \nmarginable equities, loans and cash deposits  \nnot included in our GCLA. The fair value of   \nour unencumbered assets averaged $216.18      \nbillion for the three months ended September  \n2020 and $194.05 billion for the three months \nended June 2020. We do not consider these     \nassets liquid enough to be eligible for our   \nGCLA. Liquidity Regulatory Framework As a BHC,\nwe are subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage\nRatio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the\nU.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR\nrule requires organizations to maintain an    \nadequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows   \nunder an acute short-term liquidity stress    \nscenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by \nsubsidiaries that is in excess of their       \nminimum requirement and is subject to transfer\nrestrictions. We are required to maintain a   \nminimum LCR of 100%. We expect that           \nfluctuations in client activity, business mix \nand the market environment will impact our    \nLCR.                                          \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs September\u00a02020\u00a0Form      142  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Stress testing is a method of \ndetermining the effect of various hypothetical\nstress scenarios. We use stress testing to    \nexamine risks of specific portfolios, as well \nas the potential impact of our significant    \nrisk exposures. We use a variety of stress    \ntesting techniques to calculate the potential \nloss from a wide range of market moves on our \nportfolios, including firmwide stress tests,  \nsensitivity analysis and scenario analysis.   \nThe results of our various stress tests are   \nanalyzed together for risk management         \npurposes. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk \nManagement\u201d for information about firmwide    \nstress tests. Sensitivity analysis is used to \nquantify the impact of a market move in a     \nsingle risk factor across all positions (e.g.,\nequity prices or credit spreads) using a      \nvariety of defined market shocks, ranging from\nthose that could be expected over a one-      \ndaytime horizon up to those that could take   \nmany months to occur. We also use sensitivity \nanalysis to quantify the impact of the default\nof any single entity, which captures the risk \nof large or concentrated exposures. Scenario  \nanalysis is used to quantify the impact of a  \nspecified event, including how the event      \nimpacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. \nFor example, for sovereign stress testing we  \ncalculate potential direct exposure associated\nwith our sovereign positions, as well as the  \ncorresponding debt, equity and currency       \nexposures associated with our non-            \nsovereignpositions that may be impacted by the\nsovereign distress. When conducting scenario  \nanalysis, we often consider a number of       \npossible outcomes for each scenario, ranging  \nfrom moderate to severely adverse market      \nimpacts. In addition, these stress tests are  \nconstructed using both historical events and  \nforward-looking hypothetical scenarios. Unlike\nVaR measures, which have an implied           \nprobability because they are calculated at a  \nspecified confidence level, there may not be  \nan implied probability that our stress testing\nscenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing \nis used to model both moderate and more       \nextreme moves in underlying market factors.   \nWhen estimating potential loss, we generally  \nassume that our positions cannot be reduced or\nhedged (although experience demonstrates that \nwe are generally able to do so).              \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs September\u00a02020\u00a0Form      146  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

These      \nstatements may relate to, among other things, \n(i) our future plans and results, including   \nour target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and    \nCET1 capital ratio, and how they can be       \nachieved,(ii) legal proceedings, governmental \ninvestigations or other contingencies as set  \nforth in Notes 27 and 18 to the consolidated  \nfinancial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-Q,(iii) the results of stress tests,  \n(iv) the objectives and effectiveness of our  \nBCP strategy, information security program,   \nrisk management and liquidity policies, (v)   \nour resolution plan and resolution strategy   \nand their implications for stakeholders, (vi) \nthe design and effectiveness of our resolution\ncapital and liquidity models and triggers and \nalerts framework, (vii) trends in or growth   \nopportunities for our businesses, including   \nthe timing, profitability, benefits and other \naspects of business and strategic initiatives \nand changes in and the importance of our      \nefficiency ratio, (viii) the effect of changes\nto regulations, and our future status,        \nactivities or reporting under banking and     \nfinancial regulation, (ix) our NSFR, (x) our  \nlevel of future compensation expense as a     \npercentage of operating expenses, (xi) our    \ninvestment banking transaction backlog, (xii) \nour expected tax rate, (xiii) the future state\nof our liquidity and regulatory capital       \nratios, and our prospective capital           \ndistributions (including dividends), (xiv) our\nexpected interest income, (xv) our credit     \nexposures, (xvi) our expected provisions for  \ncredit losses, (xvii) our preparations for    \nBrexit, (xviii) the replacement of LIBOR and  \nother IBORs and our program for the transition\nto alternative risk-free reference rates,     \n(xix) the adequacy of our allowance for credit\nlosses, (xx) the projected growth of our      \ndeposits and related interest expense savings,\n(xxi) the projected growth of our installment \nloan and credit card businesses, (xxii) our   \nbusiness initiatives, includingtransaction    \nbankingand new consumer financial products,   \n(xxiii) our expense savings and strategic     \nlocations initiatives, (xxiv) our planned 2020\nparent vanilla debt issuances, (xxv) the      \namount of GCLA we expect to hold, (xxvi) our  \nexpected SCB and G-SIBsurcharge,(xxvii) the   \nimpact of the COVID-19pandemic on our         \nbusiness, results, financial position and     \nliquidity, (xxviii) the settlements relating  \nto 1MDB, including the asset recovery         \nguarantee and our remediation activities and  \n(xxix) expenses we may incur, including future\nlitigation expense and expenses from investing\nin our installment loan, credit card and      \ntransaction banking businesses. By identifying\nthese statements for you in this manner, we   \nare alerting you to the possibility that our  \nactual results, financial condition and       \nliquidity may differ, possibly materially,    \nfrom the anticipated results, financial       \ncondition and liquidity in these forward-     \nlooking statements. Important factors that    \ncould cause our results, financial condition  \nand capital actions to differ from those in   \nthese statements include, among others, those \ndescribed below and in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part \nII, Item 1A of this Form 10-Qand in Part I,   \nItem 1A of the 2019 Form 10-K. Statements     \nabout our investment banking transaction      \nbacklog are subject to the risk that such     \ntransactions may be modified or may not be    \ncompleted at all and related net revenues may \nnot be realized or may be materially less than\nexpected. Important factors that could have   \nsuch a result include, for underwriting       \ntransactions, a decline or weakness in general\neconomic conditions, an outbreak of           \nhostilities, volatility in the securities     \nmarkets or an adverse development with respect\nto the issuer of the securities and, for      \nfinancial advisory transactions, a decline in \nthe securities markets, an inability to obtain\nadequate financing, an adverse development    \nwith respect to a party to the transaction or \na failure to obtain a required regulatory     \napproval.

Statements about our future effective   \nincome tax rate are subject to the risk that  \nit may differ from the anticipated rate       \nindicated in such statements, possibly        \nmaterially, due to, among other things,       \nchanges in our earnings mix, our profitability\nand entities in which we generate profits, the\nassumptions we have made in forecasting our   \nexpected tax rate, as well as guidance that   \nmay be issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue    \nService. Statements about our NSFR and SCB are\nbased on our current interpretation and       \nexpectations of the relevant final rules, and \nreflect significant assumptions about how our \nNSFR and SCB are calculated. Our actual SCB   \nwill depend on the results of the applicable  \nsupervisory stress tests, and the methods used\nto calculate our NSFR and SCB may differ,     \npossibly materially, from those used to       \ncalculate our NSFR and SCB for future         \ndisclosures. Statements about the level of    \ncompensation expense, including as a          \npercentage of operating expenses, and our     \nefficiency ratio as our platform business     \ninitiatives reach scale are subject to the    \nrisks that the compensation and other costs to\noperate our businesses, including platform    \ninitiatives, may be greater than currently    \nexpected.                                     \n                                              \n  159    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form\u00a0   \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis          \nStatements about our expected provisions for  \ncredit losses are subject to the risk that    \nactual credit losses may differ and our       \nexpectations may change, possibly materially, \nfrom that currently anticipated due to, among \nother things, changes to the composition of   \nour loan portfolio and changes in the economic\nenvironment in future periods and our         \nforecasts of future economic conditions, as   \nwell as changes in our models, policies and   \nother management judgments. Statements about  \nthe projected growth of our deposits and      \nassociated interest expense savings, and our  \ninstallment loan and credit card businesses,  \nare subject to the risk that actual growth may\ndiffer, possibly materially, from that        \ncurrently anticipated due to, among other     \nthings, changes in interest rates and         \ncompetition from other similar products.      \nStatements about our target ROE, ROTE,        \nefficiency ratio, and expense savings, and how\nthey can be achieved, are based on our current\nexpectations regarding our business prospects \nand are subject to the risk that we may be    \nunable to achieve our targets due to, among   \nother things, changes in our business mix,    \nlower profitability of new business           \ninitiatives, increases in technology and other\ncosts to launch and bring new business        \ninitiatives to scale, and increases in        \nliquidity requirements. Statements about our  \ntarget ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratio, and  \nhow they can be achieved, are based on our    \ncurrent expectations regarding the capital    \nrequirements applicable to us and are subject \nto the risk that our actual capital           \nrequirements may be higher than currently     \nanticipated because of, among other factors,  \nchanges in the regulatory capital requirements\napplicable to us resulting from changes in    \nregulations or the interpretation or          \napplication of existing regulations or changes\nin the nature and composition of our          \nactivities. Statements about the timing,      \ncosts, profitability, benefits and other      \naspects of business and expense savings       \ninitiatives, the level and composition of more\ndurable revenues and increases in market share\nare based on our current expectations         \nregarding our ability to implement these      \ninitiatives and actual results may differ,    \npossibly materially, from current expectations\ndue to, among other things, a delay in the    \ntiming of these initiatives, increased        \ncompetition and an inability to reduce        \nexpenses and grow businesses with durable     \nrevenues. Statements about planned 2020 parent\nvanilla debt issuances and the amount of GCLA \nwe expect to hold are subject to the risk that\nactual issuances and GCLA levels may differ,  \npossibly materially, from that currently      \nexpected due to changes in market conditions, \nbusiness opportunities or our funding and     \nprojected liquidity needs. Statements about   \nthe future state of our liquidity and         \nregulatory capital ratios, as well as our     \nprospective capital distributions (including  \ndividends), are subject to the risk that our  \nactual liquidity, regulatory capital ratios   \nand capital distributions may differ, possibly\nmaterially, from what is currently expected   \ndue to, among other things, the need to use   \ncapital to support clients, increased         \nregulatory requirements and changes to the    \ncomposition of our balance sheet. Statements  \nabout the risk exposure related to the asset  \nrecovery guarantee provided to the Government \nof Malaysia are subject to the risk that the  \nactual value of assets and proceeds from      \nassets seized and returned to the Government  \nof Malaysia may be less than currently        \nanticipated. Statements about the application \nfor and pursuit of exemptions and             \nauthorizations from regulatory authorities,   \nincluding the U.S. Department of Labor, in    \nconnection with the settlements relating to   \n1MDB and the progress or the status of        \nremediation activities relating to 1MDB are   \nbased on our expectations regarding the       \nprospects for receiving the exemptions and    \nauthorizations and the current remediation    \nplans. Accordingly, our ability to receive the\nexemptions and authorizations and complete the\nremediation activities may change, possibly   \nmaterially, from what is currently expected.  \n                                              \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs September\u00a02020\u00a0Form      160  \n  10-Q                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nItem 3.

In addition, no change\nin our internal control over financial        \nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)under  \nthe Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter \nended September 2020 that has materially      \naffected, or is reasonably likely to          \nmaterially affect, our internal control over  \nfinancial reporting. PART II. OTHER           \nINFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are  \ninvolved in a number of judicial, regulatory  \nand arbitration proceedings concerning matters\narising in connection with the conduct of our \nbusinesses. Many of these proceedings are in  \nearly stages, and many of these cases seek an \nindeterminate amount of damages. We have      \nestimated the upper end of the range of       \nreasonably possible aggregate loss for matters\nwhere we have been able to estimate a range   \nand we believe, based on currently available  \ninformation, that the results of matters where\nwe have not been able to estimate a range of  \nreasonably possible loss, in the aggregate,   \nwill not have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition, but may be material to   \nour operating results in a given period. Given\nthe range of litigation and investigations    \npresently under way, our litigation expenses  \ncan be expected to remain high.

Item 1A. Risk Factors Our        \nbusinesses, financial condition, liquidity and\nresults of operations have been, and may in   \nthe future be, adversely affected by the      \nCOVID-19pandemic. The coronavirus             \n(COVID-19)pandemic has created economic and   \nfinancial disruptions that have in the past   \nadversely affected, and may in the future     \nadversely affect, our business, financial     \ncondition, liquidity and results of           \noperations. The extent to which the           \nCOVID-19pandemic will negatively affect our   \nbusinesses, financial condition, liquidity and\nresults of operations will depend on future   \ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and  \ncannot be predicted. While financial markets  \nhave rebounded from the significant declines  \nthat occurred earlier in the pandemic and     \nglobal economic conditions showed signs of    \nimprovement in the third quarter of 2020, many\nof the circumstances that arose or became more\npronounced after the onset of the             \nCOVID-19pandemic persisted at the end of the  \nquarter, including (i) muted levels of        \nbusiness activity across many sectors of the  \neconomy, relatively weak consumer confidence  \nand high unemployment; (ii) elevated levels of\nmarket volatility; (iii) the federal funds    \nrate and yields on U.S. Treasury securities   \nnear zero; (iv) substantial uncertainty about \nwhether previously announced merger and       \nacquisition deals will be completed or        \nrestructured; (v) heightened credit risk with \nregard to industries that have been most      \nseverely impacted by the pandemic, including  \noil and gas, gaming and lodging, and airlines;\n(vi) greater emphasis by investors on         \nliquidity products, which generate lower fees,\nrelative to risk assets, resulting in these   \nproducts comprising a higher share of AUS as  \ncompared to the pre-pandemiccomposition; and  \n(vii) higher cyber security, information      \nsecurity and operational risks as a result of \nwork-from-home arrangements. Depending on the \nduration and severity of the pandemic going   \nforward, as well as the effects of the        \npandemic on consumer and corporate confidence,\nthe conditions noted above could continue for \nan extended period and other adverse          \ndevelopments may occur or reoccur, including  \n(i) a repeat, or worse, of the decline in the \nvaluation of equity, fixed-income and         \ncommodity markets that occurred at the outset \nof the pandemic; (ii) further declines in U.S.\ninterest rates, to zero or below; (iii) market\ndislocations that may make hedging strategies \nless effective or ineffective; (iv) a         \nreduction in fees on AUS due to declines in   \nthe valuation of assets or a protracted trend \ntoward asset classes that generate lower fees;\n(v) disruption in the new issuance markets for\ndebt and equity, leading to a decline in      \nactivity; (vi) a further deterioration in the \nliquidity profile of corporate borrowers,     \nresulting in additional draws on credit lines;\nand (vii) greater challenges in valuing       \nderivative positions and associated           \ncollateral, leading to significant increases  \nin collateral calls and valuation disputes.   \n                                              \n  161    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0September\u00a02020\u00a0Form    \n         10-Q                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe effects of the                            \nCOVID-19pandemic on                           \neconomic and market                           \nconditions have in the                        \npast and may in the                           \nfuture also increase                          \ndemands on our                                \nliquidity as we meet                          \nclient needs.
