AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nConsolidation The firm consolidates entities\nin which the firm has a controlling financial\ninterest. The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a\nvoting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)\nthe total equity investment at risk is\nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity\nholders have the power to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the\nentity and the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting\ninterest entity is ownership of a majority\nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest\nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable\nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that\nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a\nvoting interest entity. The firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when\nthe firm has a variable interest or interests\nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive\nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for\nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method\nInvestments. When the firm does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity\nbut can exert significant influence over the\nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair\nvalue by electing the fair value option\navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant\ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns\n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstance common stock. In certain cases, the\nfirm applies the equity method of accounting\nto new investments that are strategic in\nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s\nprincipal business activities, when the firm\nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or\nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less\nsignificant. See Note 8 for further\ninformation about equity-method investments.\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed\ninvestment funds with third-party investors.\nThese funds are typically organized as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies\nfor which the firm acts as general partner or\nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a\nmajority of the economic interests in these\nfunds. These funds are usually voting interest\nentities and generally are not consolidated\nbecause third-party investors typically have\nrights to terminate the funds or to remove the\nfirm as general partner or manager.\nInvestments in these funds are generally\nmeasured at net asset value (NAV) and are\nincluded in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and\n22 for further information about investments\nin funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of\nthese consolidated financial statements\nrequires management to make certain estimates\nand assumptions, the most important of which\nrelate to fair value measurements, the\nallowance for credit losses on loans and\nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,\naccounting for goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, provisions for losses that\nmay arise from litigation and regulatory\nproceedings (including governmental\ninvestigations), and accounting for income\ntaxes. These estimates and assumptions are\nbased on the best available information, but\nactual results could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition Financial Assets and\nLiabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and\nliabilities and certain investments are\ncarried at fair value either under the fair\nvalue option or in accordance with other U.S.\nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to\naccount for certain of its loans and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nby electing the fair value option. The fair\nvalue of a financial instrument is the amount\nthat would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked\nto bid prices and financial liabilities are\nmarked to offer prices. Fair value\nmeasurements do not include transaction costs.\nFair value gains or losses are generally\nincluded in market making or other principal\ntransactions. See Note 4 for further\ninformation about fair value measurements.\n                                          \n  7    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                          \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with\nclients for services, such as investment\nbanking, investment management, and execution\nand clearing (contracts with clients), when\nthe performance obligations related to the\nunderlying transaction are completed. Revenues\nfrom contracts with clients represent\napproximately 45% of total non-interest\nrevenues (including approximately 85% of\ninvestment banking revenues, approximately 95%\nof investment management revenues and all\ncommissions and fees) for each of the three\nand six months ended June 2024 and June 2023).\nSee Note 25 for information about net revenues\nby business segment. Investment Banking\nAdvisory. Fees from financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues when\nthe services related to the underlying\ntransaction are completed under the terms of\nthe assignment. Non-refundable deposits and\nmilestone payments in connection with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nin revenues upon completion of the underlying\ntransaction or when the assignment is\notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nwhen incurred and are included in transaction\nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such\nexpenses are included in investment banking\nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon\ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses\nassociated with underwriting assignments are\ngenerally deferred until the related revenue\nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise\nconcluded. Such expenses are included in\ntransaction based expenses for completed\nassignments. Investment Management The firm\nearns management fees and incentive fees for\ninvestment management services, which are\nincluded in investment management revenues.\nThe firm makes payments to brokers and\nadvisors related to the placement of the\nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),\nwhich are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily NAV and are received monthly. Management\nfees for hedge funds are calculated as a\npercentage of month-end NAV and are generally\nreceived quarterly. Management fees for\nseparately managed accounts are calculated as\na percentage of either the daily or monthly\nNAV and are received quarterly. Management\nfees for private equity funds are calculated\nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are generally received\nquarterly, semi-annually or annually,\ndepending on the fund. Management fees are\nrecognized over time in the period the\nservices are provided. Distribution fees paid\nby the firm are calculated based on either a\npercentage of the management fee, the\ninvestment fund\u2019s NAV or the committed\ncapital. Such fees are included in transaction\nbased expenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees\nare calculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or\nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other\nperformance target. Incentive fees are\ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a\nfund. Fees that are based on performance over\na twelve-month period are subject to\nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment\nperformance over the life of the fund, future\ninvestment underperformance may require fees\npreviously distributed to the firm to be\nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned\nfrom a fund or separately managed account are\nrecognized when it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal of such fees will not\noccur, which is generally when such fees are\nno longer subject to fluctuations in the\nmarket value of investments held by the fund\nor separately managed account. Therefore,\nincentive fees recognized during the period\nmay relate to performance obligations\nsatisfied in previous periods.\n                                          \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    8  \n                                          \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nCommissions and Fees The firm earns\nsubstantially all commissions and fees from\nexecuting and clearing client transactions on\nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter (OTC) transactions.\nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides\nthird-party research services to clients in\nconnection with certain soft-dollar\narrangements. Third-party research costs\nincurred by the firm in connection with such\narrangements are presented net within\ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance\nObligations Remaining performance obligations\nare services that the firm has committed to\nperform in the future in connection with its\ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining\nperformance obligations are generally related\nto its financial advisory assignments and\ncertain investment management activities.\nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory\nassignments cannot be determined until the\noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s\ninvestment management activities, where fees\nare calculated based on the NAV of the fund or\nseparately managed account, future revenues\nassociated with such remaining performance\nobligations cannot be determined as such fees\nare subject to fluctuations in the market\nvalue of investments held by the fund or\nseparately managed account. The firm is able\nto determine the future revenues associated\nwith management fees calculated based on\ncommitted capital. As of June 2024,\nsubstantially all future net revenues\nassociated with such remaining performance\nobligations will be recognized through 2032.\nAnnual revenues associated with such\nperformance obligations average less than $\n300million through 2032. Transfers of\nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has\nrelinquished control over the assets\ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses\nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or\nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement with transferred\nfinancial assets are initially recognized at\nfair value. For transfers of financial assets\nthat are not accounted for as sales, the\nassets are generally included in trading\nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a\ncollateralized financing, with the related\ninterest expense recognized over the life of\nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about transfers of financial\nassets accounted for as collateralized\nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted\nfor as sales. Cash and Cash Equivalents The\nfirm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid\novernight deposits held in the ordinary course\nof business. Cash and cash equivalents\nincluded cash and due from banks of $\n7.77billion as of June 2024 and $ 7.93billion\nas of December 2023. Cash and cash equivalents\nalso included interest-bearing deposits with\nbanks of $ 198.56billion as of June 2024 and $\n233.65billion as of December 2023. The firm\nsegregates cash for regulatory and other\npurposes related to client activity. Cash and\ncash equivalents segregated for regulatory and\nother purposes were $ 14.31billion as of June\n2024 and $ 17.08billion as of December 2023.\nIn addition, the firm segregates securities\nfor regulatory and other purposes related to\nclient activity. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about segregated securities.\nCustomer and Other Receivables Customer and\nother receivables included receivables from\ncustomers and counterparties of $ 97.08billion\nas of June 2024 and $ 90.16billion as of\nDecember 2023, and receivables from brokers,\ndealers and clearing organizations of $\n44.92billion as of June 2024 and $\n42.33billion as of December 2023. Such\nreceivables primarily consist of customer\nmargin loans, collateral posted in connection\nwith certain derivative transactions, and\nreceivables resulting from unsettled\ntransactions. Substantially all of these\nreceivables are accounted for at amortized\ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,\nwhich generally approximates fair value. As\nthese receivables are not accounted for at\nfair value, they are not included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5.\nHad these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of\nboth June 2024 and December 2023. See Note 10\nfor further information about customer and\nother receivables accounted for at fair value\nunder the fair value option. Interest on\ncustomer and other receivables is recognized\nover the life of the transaction and included\nin interest income. Customer and other\nreceivables includes receivables from\ncontracts with clients and contract assets.\nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to\nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s\nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n4.09billion as of June 2024 and $ 3.59billion\nas of December 2023. As of both June 2024 and\nDecember 2023, contract assets were not\nmaterial.\n                                          \n  9    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                          \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Customer and other\npayables are accounted for at cost plus\naccrued interest, which generally approximates\nfair value. As these payables are not\naccounted for at fair value, they are not\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 and 5. Had these payables been\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,\nsubstantially all would have been classified\nin level 2 as of both June 2024 and December\n2023. Interest on customer and other payables\nis recognized over the life of the transaction\nand included in interest expense. Offsetting\nAssets and Liabilities To reduce credit\nexposures on derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter\ninto master netting agreements or similar\narrangements (collectively, netting\nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such\ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a\ncontract with a counterparty that permits net\nsettlement of multiple transactions with that\ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of\ntermination rights by a non-defaulting party.\nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all\ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is\ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with\nrespect to its derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms\nof the related credit support agreements or\nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit\nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit\nsupport agreement grants the non-defaulting\nparty exercising termination rights the right\nto liquidate the collateral and apply the\nproceeds to any amounts owed. In order to\nassess enforceability of the firm\u2019s right of\nsetoff under netting and credit support\nagreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in\nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the\nagreement. Derivatives are reported on a net-\nby-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for derivative assets and\nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the\nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting\nagreement. Resale agreements and securities\nsold under agreements to repurchase\n(repurchase agreements) and securities\nborrowed and loaned transactions with the same\nsettlement date are presented on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis in the consolidated balance\nsheets when such transactions meet certain\nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements. In the consolidated balance\nsheets, derivatives are reported net of cash\ncollateral received and posted under\nenforceable credit support agreements, when\ntransacted under an enforceable netting\nagreement. In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and\nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not\nreported net of the related cash and\nsecurities received or posted as collateral.\nSee Note 11 for further information about\ncollateral received and pledged, including\nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See\nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about\noffsetting assets and liabilities. Share-Based\nCompensation The cost of employee services\nreceived in exchange for a share-based award\nis generally measured based on the grant-date\nfair value of the award. Share-based awards\nthat do not require future service (i.e.,\nvested awards, including awards granted to\nretirement-eligible employees) are expensed\nimmediately. Share-based awards that require\nfuture service are amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recorded when\nthey occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on\nrestricted stock units (RSUs) are generally\ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that\nrequire future service are forfeited, the\nrelated dividend equivalents originally\ncharged to retained earnings are reclassified\nto compensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues\nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of\nshare-based awards. In limited cases, as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements,\nthe firm may cash settle share-based\ncompensation awards accounted for as equity\ninstruments. For these awards, additional\npaid-in capital is adjusted to the extent of\nthe difference between the value of the award\nat the time of cash settlement and the grant-\ndate value of the award. The tax effect\nrelated to the settlement of share-based\nawards and payments of dividend equivalents is\nrecorded in income tax benefit or expense.\nForeign Currency Translation Assets and\nliabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies\nare translated at rates of exchange prevailing\non the date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at\naverage rates of exchange for the period.\nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies\nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a\nnon-U.S. operation, when the functional\ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are\nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive\nincome.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    10  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value Measurements The fair value\nof a financial instrument is the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid\nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not\ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures\ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active\nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by\nreference to prices for similar instruments,\nquoted prices or recent transactions in less\nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or\nindependently sourced inputs, including, but\nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities,\nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding\nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference\nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower\ncould finance a given financial instrument\nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.\nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for\ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This\nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving\nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based\non the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In\nevaluating the significance of a valuation\ninput, the firm considers, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to\nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as\nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical,\nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.\nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are\nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values\nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial\nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain\nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and\nliabilities may require valuation adjustments\nthat a market participant would require to\narrive at fair value for factors, such as\ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments\nare generally based on market evidence.\nThe table below presents financial assets and\nliabilities carried at fair value.\n                                              \n  $

See Note 5 for further\ninformation about significant unobservable\ninputs used to value level 3 financial\ninstruments. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Trading Cash\nInstruments, Investments and Loans Level 1.\nLevel 1 instruments include U.S. government\nobligations, most non-U.S. government\nobligations, certain agency obligations,\ncertain corporate debt instruments, certain\nmoney market instruments and actively traded\nlisted equities. These instruments are valued\nusing quoted prices for identical unrestricted\ninstruments in active markets. The firm\ndefines active markets for equity instruments\nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market\ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm\ndefines active markets for debt instruments\nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity.\nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain\nnon-U.S. government obligations, most agency\nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and\nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,\nmost state and municipal obligations, most\nmoney market instruments, most other debt\nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed\nequities, certain private equities,\ncommodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be\nverified to quoted prices, recent trading\nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative\npricing sources with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency. Consideration is given to\nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor executable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Valuation\nadjustments are typically made to level 2\ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject\nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair\nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally\nbased on market evidence. Level 3. Level 3\ninstruments have one or more significant\nvaluation inputs that are not observable.\nAbsent evidence to the contrary, level 3\ninstruments are initially valued at\ntransaction price, which is considered to be\nthe best initial estimate of fair value.\nSubsequently, the firm uses other\nmethodologies to determine fair value, which\nvary based on the type of instrument.\nValuation inputs and assumptions are changed\nwhen corroborated by substantive observable\nevidence, including values realized on sales.\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments\nvary by instrument, but are generally based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques. The valuation\ntechniques and the nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair values of\neach type of level 3 instrument are described\nbelow: Loans and Securities Backed by\nCommercial Real Estate Loans and securities\nbacked by commercial real estate are directly\nor indirectly collateralized by a single\nproperty or a portfolio of properties, and may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. Significant inputs are\ngenerally determined based on relative value\nanalyses and include: \u2022 Market yields implied\nby transactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and changes in market\nindices, such as the CMBX (an index that\ntracks the performance of commercial mortgage\nbonds); \u2022 Transaction prices in both the\nunderlying collateral and instruments with the\nsame or similar underlying collateral; \u2022 A\nmeasure of expected future cash flows in a\ndefault scenario (recovery rates) implied by\nthe value of the underlying collateral, which\nis mainly driven by current performance of the\nunderlying collateral and capitalization\nrates. Recovery rates are expressed as a\npercentage of notional or face value of the\ninstrument and reflect the benefit of credit\nenhancements on certain instruments; and \u2022\nTiming of expected future cash flows\n(duration) which, in certain cases, may\nincorporate the impact of any loan\nforbearances and other unobservable inputs\n(e.g., prepayment speeds). Loans and\nSecurities Backed by Residential Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by residential\nreal estate are directly or indirectly\ncollateralized by portfolios of residential\nreal estate and may include tranches of\nvarying levels of subordination. Significant\ninputs are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons to instruments with similar\ncollateral and risk profiles. Significant\ninputs include: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets; \u2022\nTransaction prices in both the underlying\ncollateral and instruments with the same or\nsimilar underlying collateral; and \u2022 Duration,\ndriven by underlying loan prepayment speeds\nand residential property liquidation\ntimelines.\n                                           \n  13    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nCorporate Debt Instruments Corporate debt\ninstruments includes corporate loans, debt\nsecurities and convertible debentures.\nSignificant inputs for corporate debt\ninstruments are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons both to prices of credit default\nswaps that reference the same or similar\nunderlying instrument or entity and to other\ndebt instruments for the same or similar\nissuer for which observable prices or broker\nquotations are available. Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks\nthe performance of corporate credit); \u2022\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions\nand, where the firm uses credit default swaps\nto value the related instrument, the cost of\nborrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n\u2022 Duration; and \u2022 Market and transaction\nmultiples for corporate debt instruments with\nconvertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities Equity securities consists\nof private equities. Recent third-party\ncompleted or pending transactions (e.g.,\nmerger proposals, debt restructurings, tender\noffers) are considered the best evidence for\nany change in fair value. When these are not\navailable, the following valuation\nmethodologies are used, as appropriate: \u2022\nIndustry multiples (primarily EBITDA and\nrevenue multiples) and public comparables; \u2022\nTransactions in similar instruments; \u2022\nDiscounted cash flow techniques; and \u2022 Third-\nparty appraisals. The firm also considers\nchanges in the outlook for the relevant\nindustry and financial performance of the\nissuer as compared to projected performance.\nSignificant inputs include: \u2022 Market and\ntransaction multiples; \u2022 Discount rates and\ncapitalization rates; and \u2022 For equity\nsecurities with debt-like features, market\nyields implied by transactions of similar or\nrelated assets, current performance and\nrecovery assumptions, and duration. Other\nTrading Cash Instruments, Investments and\nLoans The significant inputs to the valuation\nof other instruments, such as non-U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations, and other\nloans and debt obligations are generally\ndetermined based on relative value analyses,\nwhich incorporate comparisons both to prices\nof credit default swaps that reference the\nsame or similar underlying instrument or\nentity and to other debt instruments for the\nsame issuer for which observable prices or\nbroker quotations are available. Significant\ninputs include: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices; \u2022 Current performance and recovery\nassumptions and, where the firm uses credit\ndefault swaps to value the related instrument,\nthe cost of borrowing the underlying reference\nobligation; and \u2022 Duration. Valuation\nTechniques and Significant Inputs for\nDerivatives The firm\u2019s level 2 and level 3\nderivatives are valued using derivative\npricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow\nmodels, correlation models and models that\nincorporate option pricing methodologies, such\nas Monte Carlo simulations). Price\ntransparency of derivatives can generally be\ncharacterized by product type, as described\nbelow. \u2022 Interest Rate. In general, the key\ninputs used to value interest rate derivatives\nare transparent, even for most long-dated\ncontracts. Interest rate swaps and options\ndenominated in the currencies of leading\nindustrialized nations are characterized by\nhigh trading volumes and tight bid/offer\nspreads. Interest rate derivatives that\nreference indices, such as an inflation index,\nor the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year\nswap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) are more\ncomplex, but the key inputs are generally\nobservable. \u2022 Credit. Price transparency for\ncredit default swaps, including both single\nnames and baskets of credits, varies by market\nand underlying reference entity or obligation.\nCredit default swaps that reference indices,\nlarge corporates and major sovereigns\ngenerally exhibit the most price transparency.\nFor credit default swaps with other\nunderliers, price transparency varies based on\ncredit rating, the cost of borrowing the\nunderlying reference obligations, and the\navailability of the underlying reference\nobligations for delivery upon the default of\nthe issuer. Credit default swaps that\nreference loans, asset-backed securities and\nemerging market debt instruments tend to have\nless price transparency than those that\nreference corporate bonds. In addition, more\ncomplex credit derivatives, such as those\nsensitive to the correlation between two or\nmore underlying reference obligations,\ngenerally have less price transparency.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    14  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Prices for currency derivatives\nbased on the exchange rates of leading\nindustrialized nations, including those with\nlonger tenors, are generally transparent. The\nprimary difference between the price\ntransparency of developed and emerging market\ncurrency derivatives is that emerging markets\ntend to be only observable for contracts with\nshorter tenors. \u2022 Commodity. Commodity\nderivatives include transactions referenced to\nenergy (e.g., oil, natural gas and\nelectricity), metals (e.g., precious and base)\nand soft commodities (e.g., agricultural).\nPrice transparency varies based on the\nunderlying commodity, delivery location, tenor\nand product quality (e.g., diesel fuel\ncompared to unleaded gasoline). In general,\nprice transparency for commodity derivatives\nis greater for contracts with shorter tenors\nand contracts that are more closely aligned\nwith major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n\u2022 Equity. Price transparency for equity\nderivatives varies by market and underlier.\nOptions on indices and the common stock of\ncorporates included in major equity indices\nexhibit the most price transparency. Equity\nderivatives generally have observable market\nprices, except for contracts with long tenors\nor reference prices that differ significantly\nfrom current market prices. More complex\nequity derivatives, such as those sensitive to\nthe correlation between two or more individual\nstocks, generally have less price\ntransparency. Liquidity is essential to the\nobservability of all product types. If\ntransaction volumes decline, previously\ntransparent prices and other inputs may become\nunobservable. Conversely, even highly\nstructured products may at times have trading\nvolumes large enough to provide observability\nof prices and other inputs. Level 1. Level 1\nderivatives include short-term contracts for\nfuture delivery of securities when the\nunderlying security is a level 1 instrument,\nand exchange-traded derivatives if they are\nactively traded and are valued at their quoted\nmarket price. Level 2. Level 2 derivatives\ninclude OTC derivatives for which all\nsignificant valuation inputs are corroborated\nby market evidence and exchange-traded\nderivatives that are not actively traded\nand/or that are valued using models that\ncalibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC\nderivatives. The selection of a particular\nmodel to value a derivative depends on the\ncontractual terms of and specific risks\ninherent in the instrument, as well as the\navailability of pricing information in the\nmarket. For derivatives that trade in liquid\nmarkets, model selection does not involve\nsignificant management judgment because\noutputs of models can be calibrated to market-\nclearing levels. Valuation models require a\nvariety of inputs, such as contractual terms,\nmarket prices, yield curves, discount rates\n(including those derived from interest rates\non collateral received and posted as specified\nin credit support agreements for\ncollateralized derivatives), credit curves,\nmeasures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss\nseverity rates and correlations of such\ninputs. Significant inputs to the valuations\nof level 2 derivatives can be verified to\nmarket transactions, broker or dealer\nquotations or other alternative pricing\nsources with reasonable levels of price\ntransparency. Consideration is given to the\nnature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or\nexecutable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Level 3 . Level 3\nderivatives are valued using models which\nutilize observable level 1 and/or level 2\ninputs, as well as unobservable level 3\ninputs. The significant unobservable inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s level 3 derivatives\nare described below. \u2022 For level 3 interest\nrate and currency derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include correlations of\ncertain currencies and interest rates (e.g.,\nthe correlation between Euro inflation and\nEuro interest rates) and specific interest\nrate and currency volatilities. \u2022 For level 3\ncredit derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs include illiquid credit spreads and\nupfront credit points, which are unique to\nspecific reference obligations and reference\nentities, and recovery rates. \u2022 For level 3\ncommodity derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include volatilities for\noptions with strike prices that differ\nsignificantly from current market prices and\nprices or spreads for certain products for\nwhich the product quality or physical location\nof the commodity is not aligned with benchmark\nindices. \u2022 For level 3 equity derivatives,\nsignificant unobservable inputs generally\ninclude equity volatility inputs for options\nthat are long-dated and/or have strike prices\nthat differ significantly from current market\nprices. In addition, the valuation of certain\nstructured trades requires the use of level 3\ncorrelation inputs, such as the correlation of\nthe price performance of two or more\nindividual stocks or the correlation of the\nprice performance for a basket of stocks to\nanother asset class, such as commodities.\n                                           \n  15    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level\n3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and\nlevel 2 inputs to reflect observable market\nchanges and any resulting gains and losses are\nclassified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are\nchanged when corroborated by evidence, such as\nsimilar market transactions, third-party\npricing services and/or broker or dealer\nquotations or other empirical market data. In\ncircumstances where the firm cannot verify the\nmodel value by reference to market\ntransactions, it is possible that a different\nvaluation model could produce a materially\ndifferent estimate of fair value. See Note 5\nfor further information about significant\nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of\nlevel 3 derivatives. Valuation Adjustments.\nValuation adjustments are integral to\ndetermining the fair value of derivative\nportfolios and are used to adjust the mid-\nmarket valuations produced by derivative\npricing models to the exit price valuation.\nThese adjustments incorporate bid/offer\nspreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and\nfunding valuation adjustments, which account\nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in\nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative\nportfolios. The firm also makes funding\nvaluation adjustments to collateralized\nderivatives where the terms of the agreement\ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge\ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are\ngenerally used when calibrating valuation\nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In\naddition, for derivatives that include\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm\nmakes model or exit price adjustments to\naccount for the valuation uncertainty present\nin the transaction. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Other Financial Assets\nand Liabilities at Fair Value In addition to\ntrading cash instruments, derivatives, and\ncertain investments and loans, the firm\naccounts for certain of its other financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value under the\nfair value option. Such instruments include\nrepurchase agreements and substantially all\nresale agreements; certain securities borrowed\nand loaned transactions; certain customer and\nother receivables, including certain margin\nloans; certain time deposits, including\nstructured certificates of deposit, which are\nhybrid financial instruments; substantially\nall other secured financings, including\ntransfers of assets accounted for as\nfinancings; certain unsecured short- and long-\nterm borrowings, substantially all of which\nare hybrid financial instruments; and certain\nother assets and liabilities. These\ninstruments are generally valued based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques, which\nincorporate inputs with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency, and are generally\nclassified in level 2 because the inputs are\nobservable. Valuation adjustments may be made\nfor liquidity and for counterparty and the\nfirm\u2019s credit quality. The significant inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s other financial\nassets and liabilities are described below.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements and\nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of resale\nand repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and interest rates. Customer and Other\nReceivables. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of receivables are interest rates,\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and funding spreads. Deposits. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of time\ndeposits are interest rates and the amount and\ntiming of future cash flows. The inputs used\nto value the embedded derivative component of\nhybrid financial instruments are consistent\nwith the inputs used to value the firm\u2019s other\nderivative instruments described above. See\nNote 7 for further information about\nderivatives and Note 13 for further\ninformation about deposits. Other Secured\nFinancings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other secured financings are the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, funding spreads and the\nfair value of the collateral delivered by the\nfirm (determined using the amount and timing\nof expected future cash flows, market prices,\nmarket yields and recovery assumptions). See\nNote 11 for further information about other\nsecured financings. Unsecured Short- and Long-\nTerm Borrowings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of unsecured short- and long-term\nborrowings are the amount and timing of\nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,\nthe credit spreads of the firm and commodity\nprices for prepaid commodity transactions. The\ninputs used to value the embedded derivative\ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are\nconsistent with the inputs used to value the\nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described\nabove. See Note 7 for further information\nabout derivatives and Note 14 for further\ninformation about borrowings. Other Assets and\nLiabilities. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other assets and liabilities are\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, market yields,\nvolatility and correlation inputs.

An average\ngreater than the median indicates that the\nmajority of inputs are below the average. For\nexample, the difference between the average\nand the median for credit spreads indicates\nthat the majority of the inputs fall in the\nlower end of the range. \u2022 The ranges, averages\nand medians of these inputs are not\nrepresentative of the appropriate inputs to\nuse when calculating the fair value of any one\nderivative. For example, the highest\ncorrelation for interest rate derivatives is\nappropriate for valuing a specific interest\nrate derivative but may not be appropriate for\nvaluing any other interest rate derivative.\nAccordingly, the ranges of inputs do not\nrepresent uncertainty in, or possible ranges\nof, fair value measurements of level 3\nderivatives. \u2022 Interest rates, currencies and\nequities derivatives are valued using option\npricing models, credit derivatives are valued\nusing option pricing, correlation and\ndiscounted cash flow models, and commodities\nderivatives are valued using option pricing\nand discounted cash flow models. \u2022 The fair\nvalue of any one instrument may be determined\nusing multiple valuation techniques. For\nexample, option pricing models and discounted\ncash flow models are typically used together\nto determine fair value. Therefore, the level\n3 balance encompasses both of these\ntechniques. \u2022 Correlation within currencies\nand equities includes cross-product type\ncorrelation. \u2022 Natural gas spread represents\nthe spread per million British thermal units\nof natural gas. \u2022 Oil spread represents the\nspread per barrel of oil and refined products.\n\u2022 Electricity price represents the price per\nmegawatt hour of electricity. Range of\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs. The following\nprovides information about the ranges of\nsignificant unobservable inputs used to value\nthe firm\u2019s level 3 derivative instruments: \u2022\nCorrelation. Ranges for correlation cover a\nvariety of underliers both within one product\ntype (e.g., equity index and equity single\nstock names) and across product types (e.g.,\ncorrelation of an interest rate and a\ncurrency), as well as across regions.\nGenerally, cross-product type correlation\ninputs are used to value more complex\ninstruments and are lower than correlation\ninputs on assets within the same derivative\nproduct type.\n                                           \n  21    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In\ngeneral, for contracts\nwhere the holder\nbenefits from the\nconvergence of the\nunderlying asset or\nindex prices (e.g.,\ninterest rates, credit\nspreads, foreign\nexchange rates,\ninflation rates and\nequity prices), an\nincrease in\ncorrelation results in\na higher fair value\nmeasurement. \u2022\nVolatility. In\ngeneral, for purchased\noptions, an increase\nin volatility results\nin a higher fair value\nmeasurement. \u2022 Credit\nspreads, upfront\ncredit points and\nrecovery rates. In\ngeneral, the fair\nvalue of purchased\ncredit protection\nincreases as credit\nspreads or upfront\ncredit points increase\nor recovery rates\ndecrease.

See Note 23\nfor further\ninformation about\ninterest income and\ninterest expense.\n\u2022 Gains/(losses)\nincluded in market\nmaking are primarily\nrelated to the firm\u2019s\ntrading assets and\nliabilities, including\nboth derivative and\nnon-derivative\nfinancial instruments.\n\u2022 Gains/(losses) are\nnot representative of\nthe manner in which\nthe firm manages its\nbusiness activities\nbecause many of the\nfirm\u2019s market-making\nand client\nfacilitation\nstrategies utilize\nfinancial instruments\nacross various product\ntypes. Accordingly,\ngains or losses in one\nproduct type\nfrequently offset\ngains or losses in\nother product types.\nFor example, most of\nthe firm\u2019s longer-term\nderivatives across\nproduct types are\nsensitive to changes\nin interest rates and\nmay be economically\nhedged with interest\nrate swaps. Similarly,\na significant portion\nof the firm\u2019s trading\ncash instruments and\nderivatives across\nproduct types has\nexposure to foreign\ncurrencies and may be\neconomically hedged\nwith foreign currency\ncontracts.\nNote 7. Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nDerivative Activities Derivatives are\ninstruments that derive their value from\nunderlying asset prices, indices, reference\nrates and other inputs, or a combination of\nthese factors. Derivatives may be traded on an\nexchange (exchange-traded) or they may be\nprivately negotiated contracts, which are\nusually referred to as OTC derivatives.\nCertain of the firm\u2019s OTC derivatives are\ncleared and settled through central clearing\ncounterparties (OTC-cleared), while others are\nbilateral contracts between two counterparties\n(bilateral OTC). Market Making. As a market\nmaker, the firm enters into derivative\ntransactions to provide liquidity to clients\nand to facilitate the transfer and hedging of\ntheir risks. In this role, the firm typically\nacts as principal and is required to commit\ncapital to provide execution, and maintains\nmarket-making positions in response to, or in\nanticipation of, client demand.\n\nRisk Management. The firm also enters into\nderivatives to actively manage risk exposures\nthat arise from its market-making and\ninvesting and financing activities. The firm\u2019s\nholdings and exposures are hedged, in many\ncases, on either a portfolio or risk-specific\nbasis, as opposed to an instrument-by-\ninstrument basis. The offsetting impact of\nthis economic hedging is reflected in the same\nbusiness segment as the related revenues. In\naddition, the firm may enter into derivatives\ndesignated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These\nderivatives are used to manage interest rate\nexposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured\nborrowings and deposits and certain U.S. and\nnon-U.S. government securities classified as\navailable-for-sale, foreign exchange risk of\ncertain available-for-sale securities and the\nnet investment in certain non-U.S. operations.\nThe firm enters into various types of\nderivatives, including: \u2022 Futures and\nForwards. Contracts that commit counterparties\nto purchase or sell financial instruments,\ncommodities or currencies in the future. \u2022\nSwaps. Contracts that require counterparties\nto exchange cash flows, such as currency or\ninterest payment streams. The amounts\nexchanged are based on the specific terms of\nthe contract with reference to specified\nrates, financial instruments, commodities,\ncurrencies or indices. \u2022 Options. Contracts in\nwhich the option purchaser has the right, but\nnot the obligation, to purchase from or sell\nto the option writer financial instruments,\ncommodities or currencies within a defined\ntime period for a specified price. Derivatives\nare reported on a net-by-counterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable or receivable for\nderivative assets and liabilities for a given\ncounterparty) when a legal right of setoff\nexists under an enforceable netting agreement\n(counterparty netting). Derivatives are\naccounted for at fair value, net of cash\ncollateral received or posted under\nenforceable credit support agreements (cash\ncollateral netting). Derivative assets are\nincluded in trading assetsand derivative\nliabilities are included in trading\nliabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and\nlosseson derivatives not designated as hedges\nare included in market making (for derivatives\nincluded in Fixed Income, Currency and\nCommodities (FICC) and Equities within Global\nBanking & Markets), and other principal\ntransactions (for derivatives included in\nInvestment banking fees and Other within\nGlobal Banking & Markets, as well as\nderivatives in Asset & Wealth Management) in\nthe consolidated statements of earnings. For\neach of the three and six months ended June\n2024 and June 2023, substantially all of the\nfirm\u2019s derivatives were included in Global\nBanking & Markets.\n                                           \n  33    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s fair value measurement\npolicies, valuation techniques and significant\ninputs used to determine the fair value of\nderivatives, and Note 5 for information about\nderivatives within the fair value hierarchy.\nCredit Derivatives The firm enters into a\nbroad array of credit derivatives to\nfacilitate client transactions and to manage\nthe credit risk associated with market-making\nand investing and financing activities. Credit\nderivatives are actively managed based on the\nfirm\u2019s net risk position. Credit derivatives\nare generally individually negotiated\ncontracts and can have various settlement and\npayment conventions. Credit events include\nfailure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of\nindebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and\ndissolution of the reference entity. The firm\nenters into the following types of credit\nderivatives: \u2022 Credit Default Swaps. Single-\nname credit default swaps protect the buyer\nagainst the loss of principal on one or more\nbonds, loans or mortgages (reference\nobligations) in the event the issuer of the\nreference obligations suffers a credit event.\nThe buyer of protection pays an initial or\nperiodic premium to the seller and receives\nprotection for the period of the contract. If\nthere is no credit event, as defined in the\ncontract, the seller of protection makes no\npayments to the buyer. If a credit event\noccurs, the seller of protection is required\nto make a payment to the buyer, calculated\naccording to the terms of the contract. \u2022\nCredit Options. In a credit option, the option\nwriter assumes the obligation to purchase or\nsell a reference obligation at a specified\nprice or credit spread. The option purchaser\nbuys the right, but does not assume the\nobligation, to sell the reference obligation\nto, or purchase it from, the option writer.\nThe payments on credit options depend either\non a particular credit spread or the price of\nthe reference obligation.\n                                           \n  35    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\n\u2022 Credit Indices, Baskets and Tranches. Credit\nderivatives may reference a basket of single-\nname credit default swaps or a broad-based\nindex. If a credit event occurs in one of the\nunderlying reference obligations, the\nprotection seller pays the protection buyer.\nThe payment is typically a pro-rata portion of\nthe transaction\u2019s total notional amount based\non the underlying defaulted reference\nobligation. In certain transactions, the\ncredit risk of a basket or index is separated\ninto various portions (tranches), each having\ndifferent levels of subordination. The most\njunior tranches cover initial defaults and\nonce losses exceed the notional amount of\nthese junior tranches, any excess loss is\ncovered by the next most senior tranche. \u2022\nTotal Return Swaps. A total return swap\ntransfers the risks relating to economic\nperformance of a reference obligation from the\nprotection buyer to the protection seller.\nTypically, the protection buyer receives a\nfloating rate of interest and protection\nagainst any reduction in fair value of the\nreference obligation, and the protection\nseller receives the cash flows associated with\nthe reference obligation, plus any increase in\nthe fair value of the reference obligation.\nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to\nwritten credit derivatives primarily by\nentering into offsetting purchased credit\nderivatives with identical underliers.\nSubstantially all of the firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative transactions are with\nfinancial institutions and are subject to\nstringent collateral thresholds. In addition,\nupon the occurrence of a specified trigger\nevent, the firm may take possession of the\nreference obligations underlying a particular\nwritten credit derivative, and consequently\nmay, upon liquidation of the reference\nobligations, recover amounts on the underlying\nreference obligations in the event of default.\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout credit\nderivatives.\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026  0        \u2026              \u2026         \n         \u2026  -        -              \u2026         \n         \u2026  \u2026        \u2026              \u2026         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 Fair values exclude\nthe effects of both\nnetting of receivable\nbalances with payable\nbalances under\nenforceable netting\nagreements, and\nnetting of cash\nreceived or posted\nunder enforceable\ncredit support\nagreements, and\ntherefore are not\nrepresentative of the\nfirm\u2019s credit\nexposure.\n\u2022 Tenor is based on\nthe remaining\ncontractual maturity\nfor substantially all\nwritten credit\nderivatives.\n\u2022 The credit spread on\nthe underlier,\ntogether with the\ntenor of the contract,\nare indicators of\npayment/performance\nrisk.

Equity securities and debt instruments,\nat fair value include investments in funds\nthat are measured at NAV of the investment\nfund. The firm uses NAV to measure the fair\nvalue of fund investments when (i) the fund\ninvestment does not have a readily\ndeterminable fair value and (ii) the NAV of\nthe investment fund is calculated in a manner\nconsistent with the measurement principles of\ninvestment company accounting, including\nmeasurement of the investments at fair value.\nSubstantially all of the firm\u2019s investments in\nfunds at NAV consist of investments in firm-\nsponsored private equity, credit, real estate\nand hedge funds where the firm co-invests with\nthird-party investors. Private equity funds\nprimarily invest in a broad range of\nindustries worldwide, including leveraged\nbuyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments\nand distressed investments. Credit funds\ngenerally invest in loans and other fixed\nincome instruments and are focused on\nproviding private high-yield capital for\nleveraged and management buyout transactions,\nrecapitalizations, financings, refinancings,\nacquisitions and restructurings for private\nequity firms, private family companies and\ncorporate issuers. Real estate funds invest\nglobally, primarily in real estate companies,\nloan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and\nproperty. Substantially all private equity,\ncredit and real estate funds are closed-end\nfunds in which the firm\u2019s investments are\ngenerally not eligible for redemption.\nDistributions will be received from these\nfunds as the underlying assets are liquidated\nor distributed, the timing of which is\nuncertain.

If the\nfirm has the intent to sell the debt security,\nor if it is more likely than not that the firm\nwill be required to sell the debt security\nbefore recovery of its amortized cost, the\ndifference between the amortized cost (net of\nallowance, if any) and the fair value of the\nsecurities is recognized as an impairment loss\nin earnings. The firm did not record any such\nimpairment losses during either the three or\nsix months ended June 2024 or June 2023.\nImpaired available-for-sale debt securities\nthat the firm has the intent and ability to\nhold are reviewed to determine if an allowance\nfor credit losses should be recorded. The firm\nconsiders various factors in such\ndetermination, including market conditions,\nchanges in issuer credit ratings and severity\nof the unrealized losses.

To\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, the firm\nclassifies its loans\nand lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at amortized cost\ninto wholesale and\nconsumer portfolios.\nThese portfolios\nrepresent the level at\nwhich the firm has\ndeveloped and\ndocumented its\nmethodology to\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. The allowance\nfor credit losses is\nmeasured on a\ncollective basis for\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics using\na modeled approach and\non an asset-specific\nbasis for loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses takes\ninto account the\nweighted average of a\nrange of forecasts of\nfuture economic\nconditions over the\nexpected life of the\nloans and lending\ncommitments. The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-\nyearperiod. For loans\nwith expected lives\nbeyond three years,\nthe model reverts to\nhistorical loss\ninformation based on a\nnon-linear modeled\napproach. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios described\nbelow.

The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for wholesale\nloans and lending\ncommitments that\nexhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics is\nmeasured using a\nmodeled approach.\nThese models determine\nthe probability of\ndefault and loss given\ndefault based on\nvarious risk factors,\nincluding internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators, the\nborrower\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial\nobligations, the\nborrower\u2019s country of\nrisk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. For\nlending commitments,\nthe methodology also\nconsiders the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding.\nIn addition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nthe loan-to-value\nratio, debt service\nratio and home price\nindex. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nwholesale loans and\nlending commitments\ninclude unemployment\nrates, GDP, credit\nspreads, commercial\nand industrial\ndelinquency rates,\nshort- and long-term\ninterest rates, and\noil prices. The\nallowance for loan\nlosses for wholesale\nloans that do not\nshare similar risk\ncharacteristics, such\nas nonaccrual loans,\nis calculated using\nthe present value of\nexpected future cash\nflows discounted at\nthe loan\u2019s effective\nrate, the observable\nmarket price of the\nloan, or, in the case\nof collateral\ndependent loans, the\nfair value of the\ncollateral less\nestimated costs to\nsell, if applicable.\nWholesale loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\nConsumer. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for consumer\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics is\ncalculated using a\nmodeled approach which\nclassifies consumer\nloans into pools based\non borrower-related\nand exposure-related\ncharacteristics that\ndifferentiate a pool\u2019s\nrisk characteristics\nfrom other pools. The\nfactors considered in\ndetermining a pool are\ngenerally consistent\nwith the risk\ncharacteristics used\nfor internal credit\nrisk measurement and\nmanagement and include\nkey metrics, such as\nFICO credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nconsumer loans include\nunemployment rates and\ndelinquency rates. The\nexpected life of\nrevolving credit card\nloans is determined by\nmodeling expected\nfuture draws and the\ntiming and amount of\nrepayments allocated\nto the funded balance.\nThe firm does not\nrecognize an allowance\nfor credit losses on\ncredit card lending\ncommitments as they\nare cancellable by the\nfirm. Installment\nloans are charged off\nwhen they are 120 days\npast due. Credit card\nloans are charged off\nwhen they are 180 days\npast due.\n\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses Rollforward\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout the allowance\nfor credit losses.\n

The allowance for\ncredit losses decreased by $ 75million during\nthe three months ended June 2024, reflecting a\nreserve release relating to the wholesale\nportfolio, partially offset by growth in the\ncredit card portfolio. Charge-offs for the\nthree months ended June 2024 for wholesale\nloans were not material and charge-offs for\nconsumer loans were primarily related to\ncredit cards. Six Months Ended June 2024. The\nallowance for credit losses decreased by $\n210million during the six months ended June\n2024, reflecting a reserve release relating to\nthe wholesale portfolio, partially offset by\ngrowth in the credit card portfolio. Charge-\noffs for the six months ended June 2024 for\nwholesale loans were not material and charge-\noffs for consumer loans were primarily related\nto credit cards. Three Months Ended June 2023.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased by $\n230million during the three months ended June\n2023, reflecting seasoning of the credit card\nportfolio, growth in the consumer point-of-\nsale loans portfolio and asset-specific\nprovisions and ratings downgrades in the\nwholesale portfolio, partially offset by lower\nbalances in corporate loans. Charge-offs for\nthe three months ended June 2023 for wholesale\nloans were primarily related to corporate\nloans (principally related to term loans\noriginated prior to 2019) and charge-offs for\nconsumer loans were primarily related to\ncredit cards. Six Months Ended June 2023. The\nallowance for credit losses decreased by $\n308million during the six months ended June\n2023, reflecting a reserve reduction of\napproximately $ 440million associated with the\nsale of Marcus loans and lower balances in\ncorporate loans, partially offset by asset-\nspecific provisions and ratings downgrades in\nthe wholesale portfolio and growth in the\nconsumer point-of-sale loans portfolio.\nCharge-offs for the six months ended June 2023\nfor wholesale loans (principally related to\nterm loans originated prior to 2019) were\nprimarily related to corporate loans and\ncharge-offs for consumer loans were primarily\nrelated to credit cards.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    50  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The primary\nreasons for electing\nthe fair value option\nare to: \u2022 Reflect\neconomic events in\nearnings on a timely\nbasis; \u2022 Mitigate\nvolatility in earnings\nfrom using different\nmeasurement attributes\n(e.g., transfers of\nfinancial assets\naccounted for as\nfinancings are\nrecorded at fair\nvalue, whereas the\nrelated secured\nfinancing would be\nrecorded on an accrual\nbasis absent electing\nthe fair value\noption); and \u2022 Address\nsimplification and\ncost-benefit\nconsiderations (e.g.,\naccounting for hybrid\nfinancial instruments\nat fair value in their\nentirety versus\nbifurcation of\nembedded derivatives\nand hedge accounting\nfor debt hosts).\nHybrid financial\ninstruments are\ninstruments that\ncontain bifurcatable\nembedded derivatives\nand do not require\nsettlement by physical\ndelivery of\nnonfinancial assets\n(e.g., physical\ncommodities). If the\nfirm elects to\nbifurcate the embedded\nderivative from the\nassociated debt, the\nderivative is\naccounted for at fair\nvalue and the host\ncontract is accounted\nfor at amortized cost,\nadjusted for the\neffective portion of\nany fair value hedges.\nIf the firm does not\nelect to bifurcate,\nthe entire hybrid\nfinancial instrument\nis accounted for at\nfair value under the\nfair value option.\n\nOther financial assets\nand liabilities\naccounted for at fair\nvalue under the fair\nvalue option include:\n\u2022 Repurchase\nagreements and\nsubstantially all\nresale agreements; \u2022\nCertain securities\nborrowed and loaned\ntransactions; \u2022\nCertain customer and\nother receivables and\ncertain other assets\nand liabilities; \u2022\nCertain time deposits\n(deposits with no\nstated maturity are\nnot eligible for a\nfair value option\nelection), including\nstructured\ncertificates of\ndeposit, which are\nhybrid financial\ninstruments; \u2022\nSubstantially all\nother secured\nfinancings, including\ntransfers of assets\naccounted for as\nfinancings; and \u2022\nCertain unsecured\nshort- and long-term\nborrowings,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich are hybrid\nfinancial instruments.\nSee Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s\nfair value measurement\npolicies, valuation\ntechniques and\nsignificant inputs\nused to determine the\nfair value of other\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities, and Note\n5 for information\nabout other financial\nassets and liabilities\nwithin the fair value\nhierarchy.

For\nfloating-rate loans\nand lending\ncommitments,\nsubstantially all\nchanges in fair value\nare attributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads, whereas for\nfixed-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nchanges in fair value\nare also attributable\nto changes in interest\nrates.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    52  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things,\nfacilitate client activities, invest excess\ncash, acquire securities to cover short\npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings with\nthe same settlement date are presented on a\nnet-by-counterparty basis when such\ntransactions meet certain settlement criteria\nand are subject to netting agreements.\nInterest on collateralized agreements, which\nis included in interest income, and\ncollateralized financings, which is included\nin interest expense, is recognized over the\nlife of the transaction. See Note 23 for\nfurther information about interest income and\ninterest expense. Resale and Repurchase\nAgreements A resale agreement is a transaction\nin which the firm purchases financial\ninstruments from a seller, typically in\nexchange for cash, and simultaneously enters\ninto an agreement to resell the same or\nsubstantially the same financial instruments\nto the seller at a stated price plus accrued\ninterest at a future date. A repurchase\nagreement is a transaction in which the firm\nsells financial instruments to a buyer,\ntypically in exchange for cash, and\nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same\nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a\nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale\nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d) involve the legal transfer of\nownership of financial instruments, they are\naccounted for as financing arrangements\nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the\nmaturity of the agreement. The financial\ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and\nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations, and\ninvestment-grade sovereign obligations. The\nfirm receives financial instruments purchased\nunder resale agreements and makes delivery of\nfinancial instruments sold under repurchase\nagreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the\nfirm monitors the market value of these\nfinancial instruments on a daily basis, and\ndelivers or obtains additional collateral due\nto changes in the market value of the\nfinancial instruments, as appropriate. For\nresale agreements, the firm typically requires\ncollateral with a fair value approximately\nequal to the carrying value of the relevant\nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRepurchase agreements and substantially all\nresale agreements are recorded at fair value\nunder the fair value option. See Note 5 for\nfurther information about repurchase and\nresale agreements. Securities Borrowed and\nLoaned Transactions In a securities borrowed\ntransaction, the firm borrows securities from\na counterparty in exchange for cash or\nsecurities. When the firm returns the\nsecurities, the counterparty returns the cash\nor securities. Interest is generally paid\nperiodically over the life of the transaction.\nIn a securities loaned transaction, the firm\nlends securities to a counterparty in exchange\nfor cash or securities. When the counterparty\nreturns the securities, the firm returns the\ncash or securities posted as collateral.\nInterest is generally paid periodically over\nthe life of the transaction. In a transaction\nwhere the firm lends securities and receives\nsecurities that can be delivered or pledged as\ncollateral, the firm recognizes the securities\nreceived within securities borrowed and the\nobligation to return those securities within\nsecurities loaned in the consolidated balance\nsheets. The firm receives securities borrowed\nand makes delivery of securities loaned. To\nmitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these securities on a\ndaily basis, and delivers or obtains\nadditional collateral due to changes in the\nmarket value of the securities, as\nappropriate. For securities borrowed\ntransactions, the firm typically requires\ncollateral with a fair value approximately\nequal to the carrying value of the securities\nborrowed transaction. Securities borrowed and\nloaned within FICC financing are recorded at\nfair value under the fair value option. See\nNote 5 for further information about\nsecurities borrowed and loaned accounted for\nat fair value. Substantially all of the\nsecurities borrowed and loaned within Equities\nfinancing are recorded based on the amount of\ncash collateral advanced or received plus\naccrued interest. The firm also reviews such\nsecurities borrowed to determine if an\nallowance for credit losses should be recorded\nby taking into consideration the fair value of\ncollateral received. As these agreements\ngenerally can be terminated on demand, they\nexhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes\nin interest rates. Therefore, the carrying\nvalue of such agreements approximates fair\nvalue.

Other secured financings\nincluded nonrecourse arrangements. Nonrecourse\nother secured financings were $ 6.11billion as\nof June 2024 and $ 5.57billion as of December\n2023. The firm has elected to apply the fair\nvalue option to substantially all other\nsecured financings because the use of fair\nvalue eliminates non-economic volatility in\nearnings that would arise from using different\nmeasurement attributes. See Note 5 for further\ninformation about other secured financings\nthat are accounted for at fair value. Other\nsecured financings that are not recorded at\nfair value are recorded based on the amount of\ncash received plus accrued interest, which\ngenerally approximates fair value. As these\nfinancings are not accounted for at fair\nvalue, they are not included in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had\nthese financings been included in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy, substantially all would\nhave been classified in level 3 as of both\nJune 2024 and December 2023.\nThe table below

Multiple\nfactors, including\nperformance\nindicators,\nmacroeconomic\nindicators, firm and\nindustry events, and\nfair value indicators,\nwere considered with\nrespect to each of\nthese reporting units\nto determine whether\nit was more likely\nthan not that the\nestimated fair value\nof each of those\nreporting units was\nless than its carrying\nvalue. The qualitative\nassessment also\nconsidered changes\nsince a quantitative\ntest across all of the\nfirm's reporting units\nwas last performed in\n2022. As a result of\nthe qualitative\nassessment, the firm\ndetermined that it was\nmore likely than not\nthat the estimated\nfair value of each\nreporting unit with\ngoodwill exceeded its\nrespective carrying\nvalue. Therefore, the\nfirm determined that\ngoodwill for each\nreporting unit was not\nimpaired and that a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest was not required.\nThere were no events\nor changes in\ncircumstances during\nthe three or six\nmonths ended June 2024\nthat would indicate\nthat it was more\nlikely than not that\nthe estimated fair\nvalue of each of the\nreporting units with\ngoodwill did not\nexceed its respective\ncarrying value as of\nJune 2024 .\n\nIdentifiable\nIntangible Assets\nThe table below\npresents identifiable\nintangible assets by\ntype.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Cust\u2026               June                    \n  lists        As of  2024     Decemb\u2026  2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Gross                                       \n  carr\u2026    $   2,308        $    2,339        \n  value                                       \n  Accu\u2026       -1,343            -1,292        \n  amor\u2026                                       \n  Net                                         \n  carr\u2026          965             1,047        \n  value                                       \n  Other                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  carr\u2026          145               866        \n  value                                       \n  Accu\u2026         -118              -736        \n  amor\u2026                                       \n  Net                                         \n  carr\u2026           27               130        \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  gross        2,453             3,205        \n  carr\u2026                                       \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  accu\u2026       -1,461            -2,028        \n  amor\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  net      $     992        $    1,177        \n  carr\u2026                                       \n  value                                       \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 The decrease in the\nnet carrying value of\nidentifiable\nintangible assets from\nDecember 2023 to June\n2024 was primarily\nattributable to the\nsale of GreenSky\nHoldings, LLC\n(GreenSky) (related\nidentifiable\nintangible assets were\nincluded in other as\nof December 2023).\n\u2022 Substantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s\nidentifiable\nintangible assets have\nfinite useful lives\nand are amortized over\ntheir estimated useful\nlives generally using\nthe straight-line\nmethod.\nThe tables below\npresent information\nabout the amortization\nof identifiable\nintangible assets.\n                                              \n         \u2026                   S\u2026               \n         \u2026                   M\u2026               \n         \u2026                   E\u2026               \n         \u2026  \u2026        \u2026       J\u2026  \u2026         \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  59     $  1\u2026     \n                                              \n                                              \n  $ in millions                               \n  Estimated future                 As of      \n  amortization                     June 2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Remainder of 2024         $  49             \n  2025                      $  91             \n  2026                      $  85             \n  2027                      $  85             \n  2028                      $  85             \n  2029                      $  84             \n                                              \n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    58  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

To the\nextent the carrying\nvalue of an asset or\nasset group exceeds\nthe projected\nundiscounted cash\nflows expected to\nresult from the use\nand eventual disposal\nof the asset or asset\ngroup, the firm\ndetermines the asset\nor asset group is\nimpaired and records\nan impairment equal to\nthe difference between\nthe estimated fair\nvalue and the carrying\nvalue of the asset or\nasset group. In\naddition, the firm\nwill recognize an\nimpairment prior to\nthe sale of an asset\nor asset group if the\ncarrying value of the\nasset or asset group\nexceeds its estimated\nfair value.There were\nno material\nimpairments or write-\ndowns during each of\nthe three or six\nmonths ended June 2024\nor June 2023.\nOperating Lease Right-\nof-Use Assets The firm\nenters into operating\nleases for real\nestate, office\nequipment and other\nassets, substantially\nall of which are used\nin connection with its\noperations. For leases\nlonger than one year,\nthe firm recognizes a\nright-of-use asset\nrepresenting the right\nto use the underlying\nasset for the lease\nterm, and a lease\nliability representing\nthe liability to make\npayments. The lease\nterm is generally\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual\nmaturity of the lease.\nFor leases where the\nfirm has the option to\nterminate or extend\nthe lease, an\nassessment of the\nlikelihood of\nexercising the option\nis incorporated into\nthe determination of\nthe lease term. Such\nassessment is\ninitially performed at\nthe inception of the\nlease and is updated\nif events occur that\nimpact the original\nassessment. An\noperating lease right-\nof-use asset is\ninitially determined\nbased on the operating\nlease liability,\nadjusted for initial\ndirect costs, lease\nincentives and amounts\npaid at or prior to\nlease commencement.\nThis amount is then\namortized over the\nlease term.Right-of-\nuse assets and\noperating lease\nliabilities recognized\n(in non-cash\ntransactions for\nleases entered into or\nassumed) by the firm\nwere $ 39million for\nthe three months ended\nJune 2024 , $\n43million for the\nthree months ended\nJune 2023, $ 53million\nfor the six months\nended June 2024 and $\n81million for the six\nmonths ended June\n2023. See Note 15 for\ninformation about\noperating lease\nliabilities. For\nleases where the firm\nwill derive no\neconomic benefit from\nleased space that it\nhas vacated or where\nthe firm has shortened\nthe term of a lease\nwhen space is no\nlonger needed, the\nfirm will record an\nimpairment or\naccelerated\namortization of right-\nof-use assets.There\nwere no material\nimpairments or\naccelerated\namortizations during\neach of the three or\nsix months ended June\n2024 or June 2023.\n\nMiscellaneous\nReceivables and Other\nMiscellaneous\nreceivables and other\nincluded: \u2022\nInvestments in\nqualified affordable\nhousing projects of $\n3.09billion as of June\n2024 and $ 3.39billion\nas of December 2023.\nThe firm receives tax\ncredits for such\ninvestments.

See Note 17 for further\ninformation about these investments. Note 16.\nSecuritization Activities The firm securitizes\nresidential and commercial mortgages,\ncorporate bonds, loans and other types of\nfinancial assets by selling these assets to\nsecuritization vehicles (e.g., trusts,\ncorporate entities and limited liability\ncompanies) or through a resecuritization. The\nfirm acts as underwriter of the beneficial\ninterests that are sold to investors. The\nfirm\u2019s residential mortgage securitizations\nare primarily in connection with government\nagency securitizations. The firm accounts for\na securitization as a sale when it has\nrelinquished control over the transferred\nfinancial assets. Prior to securitization, the\nfirm generally accounts for assets pending\ntransfer at fair value and therefore does not\ntypically recognize significant gains or\nlosses upon the transfer of assets. Net\nrevenues from underwriting activities are\nrecognized in connection with the sales of the\nunderlying beneficial interests to investors.\n                                           \n  63    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nprimary risks included\nin beneficial\ninterests and other\ninterests from the\nfirm\u2019s continuing\ninvolvement with\nsecuritization\nvehicles are the\nperformance of the\nunderlying collateral,\nthe position of the\nfirm\u2019s investment in\nthe capital structure\nof the securitization\nvehicle and the market\nyield for the\nsecurity. Interests\naccounted for at fair\nvalue are primarily\nclassified in level 2\nof the fair value\nhierarchy.

Due to the\nnature and fair value of certain of these\nretained interests, the weighted average\nassumptions for constant prepayment and\ndiscount rates and the related sensitivity to\nadverse changes are not meaningful as of both\nJune 2024 and December 2023. The firm\u2019s\nmaximum exposure to adverse changes in the\nvalue of these interests is the carrying value\nof $ 568million as of June 2024 and $\n685million as of December 2023.\n\nNote 17. Variable Interest Entities A variable\ninterest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt\nor equity) or other interest (e.g.,\nderivatives or loans and lending commitments)\nthat will absorb portions of the VIE\u2019s\nexpected losses and/or receive portions of the\nVIE\u2019s expected residual returns. The firm\u2019s\nvariable interests in VIEs include senior and\nsubordinated debt; loans and lending\ncommitments; limited and general partnership\ninterests; preferred and common equity;\nderivatives that may include foreign currency,\nequity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and\ncertain of the fees the firm receives from\ninvestment funds. Certain interest rate,\nforeign currency and credit derivatives the\nfirm enters into with VIEs are not variable\ninterests because they create, rather than\nabsorb, risk. VIEs generally finance the\npurchase of assets by issuing debt and equity\nsecurities that are either collateralized by\nor indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The\ndebt and equity securities issued by a VIE may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. The firm\u2019s involvement with\nVIEs includes securitization of financial\nassets, as described in Note 16, and\ninvestments in and loans to other types of\nVIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the\nfirm\u2019s consolidation policies, including the\ndefinition of a VIE. VIE Consolidation\nAnalysis The enterprise with a controlling\nfinancial interest in a VIE is known as the\nprimary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE.\nThe firm determines whether it is the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis\nthat principally considers: \u2022 Which variable\ninterest holder has the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly\nimpact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; \u2022 Which\nvariable interest holder has the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s purpose\nand design, including the risks the VIE was\ndesigned to create and pass through to its\nvariable interest holders; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s capital\nstructure; \u2022 The terms between the VIE and its\nvariable interest holders and other parties\ninvolved with the VIE; and \u2022 Related-party\nrelationships. The firm reassesses its\nevaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when\ncertain reconsideration events occur. The firm\nreassesses its determination of whether it is\nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and\ncircumstances.\n                                           \n  65    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\npurchases and sells\nbeneficial interests\nissued by mortgage-\nbacked VIEs in\nconnection with\nmarket-making\nactivities. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into derivatives\nwith certain of these\nVIEs, primarily\ninterest rate swaps,\nwhich are typically\nnot variable\ninterests. The firm\ngenerally enters into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk.\nReal Estate, Credit-\nand Power-Related, Tax\nCredit and Other\nInvesting VIEs . The\nfirm purchases equity\nand debt securities\nissued by and makes\nloans to VIEs that\nhold real estate,\nperforming and\nnonperforming debt,\ndistressed loans,\npower-related assets\nand equity securities.\nThe firm also makes\nequity investments in\nVIEs that invest in\nqualified affordable\nhousing and renewable\nenergy projects\ndesigned to generate a\nreturn through the\nrealization of tax\ncredits and related\ntax benefits. The firm\ngenerally does not\nsell assets to, or\nenter into derivatives\nwith, these VIEs.\nCorporate Debt and\nOther Asset-Backed\nVIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue notes to\nclients, purchases and\nsells beneficial\ninterests issued by\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs in connection\nwith market-making\nactivities, and makes\nloans to VIEs that\nwarehouse corporate\ndebt. Certain of these\nVIEs synthetically\ncreate the exposure\nfor the beneficial\ninterests they issue\nby entering into\ncredit derivatives\nwith the firm, rather\nthan purchasing the\nunderlying assets. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into\nderivatives, such as\ntotal return swaps,\nwith certain corporate\ndebt and other asset-\nbacked VIEs, under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE a return due\nto the beneficial\ninterest holders and\nreceives the return on\nthe collateral owned\nby the VIE. The\ncollateral owned by\nthese VIEs is\nprimarily other asset-\nbacked loans and\nsecurities. The firm\nmay be removed as the\ntotal return swap\ncounterparty and may\nenter into derivatives\nwith other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk\nrelated to these\nswaps. The firm may\nsell assets to the\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs it structures.\n\nPrincipal-Protected\nNote VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs\nown portfolios of\nassets, principally\nwith exposure to hedge\nfunds. Substantially\nall of the principal\nprotection on the\nnotes issued by these\nVIEs is provided by\nthe asset portfolio\nrebalancing that is\nrequired under the\nterms of the notes.\nThe firm enters into\ntotal return swaps\nwith these VIEs under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE the return due\nto the principal-\nprotected note holders\nand receives the\nreturn on the assets\nowned by the VIE.

The carrying value of lending\ncommitments held for sale was a liability of $\n55million as of June 2024 and $ 70million as\nof December 2023. The estimated fair value of\nsuch lending commitments approximates the\ncarrying value.

The firm also extends\nlending commitments in connection with other\ntypes of corporate lending, commercial real\nestate financing and other collateralized\nlending.See Note 9 for further information\nabout funded loans. To mitigate the credit\nrisk associated with the firm\u2019s commercial\nlending activities, the firm obtains credit\nprotection on certain loans and lending\ncommitments through credit default swaps, both\nsingle-name and index-based contracts, and\nthrough the issuance of credit-linked notes.\nWarehouse Financing.

The firm\u2019s funding\nof these commitments depends on the\nsatisfaction of all contractual conditions to\nthe resale agreement and these commitments can\nexpire unused. Investment Commitments\nInvestment commitments includes commitments to\ninvest in private equity, real estate and\nother assets directly and through funds that\nthe firm raises and manages.

See the\ntables in\n\u201cCommitments\u201d above\nfor a summary of the\nfirm\u2019s commitments.\n\u2022 The carrying value for derivatives included\nderivative assets of $ 365million as of June\n2024 and $ 359million as of December 2023, and\nderivative liabilities of $ 4.93billion as of\nJune 2024 and $ 5.60billion as of December\n2023.\n\nDerivative Guarantees. The firm enters into\nvarious derivatives that meet the definition\nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including\nwritten equity and commodity put options,\nwritten currency contracts and interest rate\ncaps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives\nare risk managed together with derivatives\nthat do not meet the definition of a\nguarantee, and therefore the amounts in the\ntable above do not reflect the firm\u2019s overall\nrisk related to derivative activities.\nDisclosures about derivatives are not required\nif they may be cash settled and the firm has\nno basis to conclude it is probable that the\ncounterparties held the underlying instruments\nat the inception of the contract. The firm has\nconcluded that these conditions have been met\nfor certain large, internationally active\ncommercial and investment bank counterparties,\ncentral clearing counterparties, hedge funds\nand certain other counterparties. Accordingly,\nthe firm has not included such contracts in\nthe table above. See Note 7 for information\nabout credit derivatives that meet the\ndefinition of a guarantee, which are not\nincluded in the table above. Derivatives are\naccounted for at fair value and therefore the\ncarrying value is considered the best\nindication of payment/performance risk for\nindividual contracts. However, the carrying\nvalues in the table above exclude the effect\nof counterparty and cash collateral netting.\nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees .\nSecurities lending and clearing guarantees\ninclude the indemnifications and guarantees\nthat the firm provides in its capacity as an\nagency lender and in its capacity as a\nsponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. As an agency lender, the firm\nindemnifies most of its securities lending\ncustomers against losses incurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not return securities and\nthe collateral held is insufficient to cover\nthe market value of the securities\nborrowed.The maximum payout of such\nindemnifications was $ 9.94billion as of June\n2024 and $ 14.19billion as of December 2023.\nCollateral held by the lenders in connection\nwith securities lending indemnifications was $\n10.30 billionas of June 2024 and $ 14.63\nbillionas of December 2023. Because the\ncontractual nature of these arrangements\nrequires the firm to obtain collateral with a\nmarket value that exceeds the value of the\nsecurities lent to the borrower, there is\nminimal performance risk associated with these\nindemnifications.\n                                           \n  71    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nAs a sponsoring member of the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the\nperformance of its sponsored member clients to\nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in\nconnection with certain resale and repurchase\nagreements. To minimize potential losses on\nsuch guarantees, the firm obtains a security\ninterest in the collateral that the sponsored\nclient placed with the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on\nsuch guarantees is minimal. The maximum payout\non this guarantee was $ 18.88billion as of\nJune 2024 and $ 14.60billion as of December\n2023. The related collateral held was $ 18.83\nbillionas of June 2024 and $ 14.69 billionas\nof December 2023. Other Financial Guarantees .\nIn the ordinary course of business, the firm\nprovides other financial guarantees of the\nobligations of third parties (e.g., standby\nletters of credit and other guarantees to\nenable clients to complete transactions and\nfund-related guarantees). These guarantees\nrepresent obligations to make payments to\nbeneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to\nfulfill its obligation under a contractual\narrangement with that beneficiary.Other\nfinancial guarantees also include a guarantee\nthat the firm has provided to the Government\nof Malaysia that it will receive, by August\n2025, at least $ 1.4billion in assets and\nproceeds from assets seized by governmental\nauthorities around the world related to\n1Malaysia Development Berhad, a sovereign\nwealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In connection\nwith this guarantee, the firm agreed to make a\none-time interim payment of $ 250million\ntowards the $ 1.4billion if the Government of\nMalaysia did not receive at least $ 500million\nin assets and proceeds by August 2022. The\nfirm does not believe that any interim payment\nis required. Any amounts paid by the firm\nwould, in any event, be subject to\nreimbursement in the event the assets and\nproceeds received by the Government of\nMalaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed $\n1.4billion. On October 11, 2023, the firm\nfiled a demand for arbitration alleging that\nthe Government of Malaysia had, as of August\n2022, recovered assets and proceeds well in\nexcess of $ 500million; it had recovered\nsubstantial additional assets and proceeds\nthat should be credited against the guarantee;\nand it had not used all reasonable efforts to\nrecover other assets and proceeds that cou ld\nbe credited against the guarantee. On November\n8, 2023, the Government of Malaysia filed a\nresponse to the firm\u2019s demand for arbitration\nand on June 10, 2024, filed an application for\na partial award to immediately enforce the\ninterim payment (plus interest). On July 24,\n2024, the arbitral tribunal rejected that\napplication. Final determinations on all\nremaining issues, including any subsequent\nenforcement of the interim payment, are to be\nmade at a (currently unscheduled) final\nhearing. The arbitral process is ongoing. See\nNote 27 for further information about matters\nrelated to 1MDB. Guarantees of Securities\nIssued by Trusts. The firm has established\ntrusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital I,\nGoldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs\nCapital III (the Trusts), and other entities,\nfor the limited purpose of issuing securities\nto third parties, lending the proceeds to the\nfirm and entering into contractual\narrangements with the firm and third parties\nrelated to this purpose. The firm does not\nconsolidate these entities. See Notes 14 and\n19 for further information about the\ntransactions involving the Trusts. The firm\neffectively provides for the full and\nunconditional guarantee of the securities\nissued by these entities. Timely payment by\nthe firm of amounts due to these entities\nunder the guarantee, borrowing, preferred\nstock and related contractual arrangements\nwill be sufficient to cover payments due on\nthe securities issued by these entities. No\nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the\nsecurities of the Trusts. Management believes\nthat it is unlikely that any circumstances\nwill occur, such as nonperformance on the part\nof paying agents or other service providers,\nthat would make it necessary for the firm to\nmake payments related to these entities other\nthan those required under the terms of the\nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and\nrelated contractual arrangements and in\nconnection with certain expenses incurred by\nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of\nService Providers. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees\ncertain service providers, such as clearing\nand custody agents, trustees and\nadministrators, against specified potential\nlosses in connection with their acting as an\nagent of, or providing services to, the firm\nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses\narising from its custodial role or caused by\nacts or omissions of third-party service\nproviders, including sub-custodians and third-\nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has\nthe right to seek indemnification from these\nthird-party service providers for certain\nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In\naddition, the firm is a member of payment,\nclearing and settlement networks, as well as\nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of\nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of\nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In\nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear\nand settle transactions entered into by\nclients with other brokerage firms. The firm\u2019s\nobligations in respect of such transactions\nare secured by the assets in the client\u2019s\naccount and proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the firm\non behalf of the client. In connection with\njoint venture investments, the firm may issue\nloan guarantees under which it may be liable\nin the event of fraud, misappropriation,\nenvironmental liabilities and other matters\ninvolving the borrower.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    72  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nThe firm is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder these guarantees\nand indemnifications\nas this depends upon\nthe occurrence of\nfuture events,\nincluding an\nassessment of claims\nthat have not yet\noccurred. However,\nmanagement believes\nthat it is unlikely\nthe firm will have to\nmake any material\npayments under these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\nguarantees and\nindemnifications have\nbeen recognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both June\n2024 and December\n2023. Other\nRepresentations,\nWarranties and\nIndemnifications. The\nfirm provides\nrepresentations and\nwarranties to\ncounterparties in\nconnection with a\nvariety of commercial\ntransactions and\noccasionally\nindemnifies them\nagainst potential\nlosses caused by the\nbreach of those\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. The firm\nmay also provide\nindemnifications\nprotecting against\nchanges in or adverse\napplication of certain\nU.S. tax laws in\nconnection with\nordinary-course\ntransactions, such as\nsecurities issuances,\nborrowings or\nderivatives. In\naddition, the firm may\nprovide\nindemnifications to\nsome counterparties to\nprotect them in the\nevent additional taxes\nare owed or payments\nare withheld, due\neither to a change in\nor an adverse\napplication of certain\nnon-U.S. tax laws.\nThese\nindemnifications, as\nwell as\nindemnifications\nprovided by the firm\non other contractual\nor other obligations,\ngenerally are standard\ncontractual terms and\nare entered into in\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness. Generally,\nthere are no stated or\nnotional amounts\nincluded in these\nindemnifications, and\nthe contingencies\ntriggering the\nobligation to\nindemnify are not\nexpected to occur.\nFuture changes in tax\nlaws and how such laws\nwould apply to these\nindemnifications\ncannot be determined.\nTherefore, the firm is\nunable to develop an\nestimate of the\nmaximum payout under\nthese guarantees and\nindemnifications.\nHowever, management\nbelieves that it is\nunlikely the firm will\nhave to make any\nmaterial payments\nunder these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\narrangements have been\nrecognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both June\n2024 and December\n2023. Guarantees of\nSubsidiaries. Group\nInc. is the entity\nthat fully and\nunconditionally\nguarantees the\nsecurities issued by\nGS Finance Corp., a\nwholly-owned finance\nsubsidiary of the\nfirm. Group Inc. has\nguaranteed the payment\nobligations of Goldman\nSachs & Co. LLC\n(GS&Co.), GS Bank USA\nand Goldman Sachs\nParis Inc. et Cie,\nsubject to certain\nexceptions. In\naddition, Group Inc.\nhas provided\nguarantees to Goldman\nSachs International\n(GSI) and GSBE related\nto agreements that\neach entity has\nentered into with\ncertain of its\ncounterparties.

Regulation and Capital Adequacy The\nFRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a\nbank holding company under the U.S. Bank\nHolding Company Act of 1956 and a financial\nholding company under amendments to this Act.\nThe firm is subject to consolidated regulatory\ncapital requirements which are calculated in\naccordance with the regulations of the FRB\n(Capital Framework). The capital requirements\nare expressed as risk-based capital and\nleverage ratios that compare measures of\nregulatory capital to risk-weighted assets\n(RWAs), average assets and off-balance sheet\nexposures. Failure to comply with these\ncapital requirements would result in\nrestrictions being imposed by the firm\u2019s\nregulators and could limit the firm\u2019s ability\nto repurchase shares, pay dividends and make\ncertain discretionary compensation payments.\nThe firm\u2019s capital levels are also subject to\nqualitative judgments by the regulators about\ncomponents of capital, risk weightings and\nother factors. Furthermore, certain of the\nfirm\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to separate\nregulations and capital requirements. Capital\nFramework The regulations under the Capital\nFramework are largely based on the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision\u2019s (Basel\nCommittee) capital framework for strengthening\ninternational capital standards (Basel III)\nand also implement certain provisions of the\nU.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act. Under the Capital\nFramework, the firm is an \u201cAdvanced\napproaches\u201d banking organization and has been\ndesignated as a global systemically important\nbank (G-SIB). The Capital Framework includes\nthe minimum risk-based capital and the capital\nconservation buffer requirements. The buffer\nmust consist entirely of capital that\nqualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)\ncapital. The firm calculates its CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in\naccordance with both the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules. Each of the ratios\ncalculated under the Standardized and Advanced\nCapital Rules must meet its respective capital\nrequirements. Under the Capital Framework, the\nfirm is also subject to leverage requirements\nwhich consist of a minimum Tier 1 leverage\nratio and a minimum supplementary leverage\nratio (SLR), as well as the SLR buffer.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    76  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In\naddition, the capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements include\nthe stress capital\nbuffer (SCB) of 5.5%\nunder the Standardized\nCapital Rules and a\nbuffer of 2.5% under\nthe Advanced Capital\nRules.\n\n\u2022 The G-SIB surcharge\nis updated annually\nbased on financial\ndata from the prior\nyear and is generally\napplicable for the\nfollowing year. The\nG-SIB surcharge is\ncalculated using two\nmethodologies, the\nhigher of which is\nreflected in the\nfirm\u2019s risk-based\ncapital requirements.\nThe first calculation\n(Method 1) is based on\nthe Basel Committee\u2019s\nmethodology which,\namong other factors,\nrelies upon measures\nof the size, activity\nand complexity of each\nG-SIB. The second\ncalculation (Method 2)\nuses similar inp uts\nbut includes a measure\nof reliance on short-\nterm wholesale\nfunding.\nBased on the firm's\n2024 Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and\nReview submission, the\nFRB has preliminarily\nset the firm's SCB to\n6.4% for the period\nfrom October 1, 2024\nthrough September 30,\n2025, which will\nincrease the firm's\nStandardized\nrequirements to 13.9%\nfor the CET1 capital\nratio, 15.4% for the\nTier 1 capital ratio\nand 17.4% for the\nTotal capital ratio.\nThe FRB has until\nAugust 31, 2024 to\nfinalize the SCB.\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout risk-based\ncapital ratios.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  mil\u2026                                        \n  As                                          \n  of                                          \n  June                                        \n  2024              Stand\u2026            Advan\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CET1    $  100,\u2026          $  100,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1       $  113,\u2026          $  113,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  2       $  14,7\u2026          $  10,8\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026    $  127,\u2026          $  124,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  RWAs    $  677,\u2026          $  633,\u2026          \n  CET1                                        \n  cap\u2026        14.9  %           15.9  %       \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1           16.7  %           17.9  %       \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  cap\u2026        18.9  %           19.6  %       \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  As                                          \n  of                                          \n  Dec\u2026                                        \n  2023                                        \n  CET1    $  99,4\u2026          $  99,4\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1       $  110,\u2026          $  110,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  2       $  14,8\u2026          $  10,6\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026    $  125,\u2026          $  120,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  RWAs    $  692,\u2026          $  665,\u2026          \n  CET1                                        \n  cap\u2026        14.4  %           14.9  %       \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1           15.9  %           16.6  %       \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  cap\u2026        18.1  %           18.2  %       \n  rat\u2026                                        \n                                              \nLeverage Ratios.

RWAs are calculated in accordance with\nboth the Standardized and Advanced Capital\nRules. Credit Risk Credit RWAs are calculated\nbased on measures of exposure, which are then\nrisk weighted under the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules: \u2022 The Standardized\nCapital Rules apply prescribed risk-weights,\nwhich depend largely on the type of\ncounterparty. The exposure measures for\nderivatives and securities financing\ntransactions are based on specific formulas\nwhich take certain factors into consideration.\n\u2022 Under the Advanced Capital Rules, the firm\ncomputes risk-weights for wholesale and retail\ncredit exposures in accordance with the\nAdvanced Internal Ratings-Based approach. The\nexposure measures for derivatives and\nsecurities financing transactions are computed\nutilizing internal models. \u2022 For both\nStandardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the\nrisk-weights for securitizations and equities\nare based on specific required formulaic\napproaches. Market Risk RWAs for market risk\nin accordance with the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules are generally\nconsistent. Market RWAs are calculated based\non measures of exposure which include the\nfollowing: \u2022 Value-at-Risk (VaR) is the\npotential loss in value of trading assets and\nliabilities, as well as certain investments,\nloans, and other financial assets and\nliabilities accounted for at fair value, due\nto adverse market movements over a defined\ntime horizon with a specified confidence\nlevel. For both risk management purposes and\nregulatory capital calculations, the firm uses\na single VaR model which captures risks,\nincluding those related to interest rates,\nequity prices, currency rates and commodity\nprices. However, VaR used for risk management\npurposes differs from VaR used for regulatory\ncapital requirements (regulatory VaR) due to\ndifferences in time horizons, confidence\nlevels and the scope of positions on which VaR\nis calculated. For risk management purposes, a\n95% one-dayVaR is used, whereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements, a 99% 10-dayVaR is used\nto determine Market RWAs and a 99% one-dayVaR\nis used to determine regulatory VaR\nexceptions. In addition, the daily net\nrevenues used to determine risk management VaR\nexceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net\nrevenues to the VaR measure calculated as of\nthe end of the prior business day) include\nintraday activity, whereas the Capital\nFramework requires that intraday activity be\nexcluded from daily net revenues when\ncalculating regulatory VaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity includes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are more likely than not to be\npositive by their nature. As a result, there\nmay be differences in the number of VaR\nexceptions and the amount of daily net\nrevenues calculated for regulatory VaR\ncompared to the amounts calculated for risk\nmanagement VaR. The firm\u2019s positional losses\nobserved on a single day did not exceed its\n99% one-day regulatory VaR during the six\nmonths ended June 2024 and exceeded its 99%\none-day regulatory VaR on one occasion during\n2023. There was no change in the firm\u2019s VaR\nmultiplier used to calculate Market RWAs; \u2022\nStressed VaR is the potential loss in value of\ntrading assets and liabilities, as well as\ncertain investments, loans, and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities accounted for\nat fair value, during a period of significant\nmarket stress; \u2022 Incremental risk is the\npotential loss in value of non-securitized\npositions due to the default or credit\nmigration of issuers of financial instruments\nover a one-year time horizon; \u2022 Comprehensive\nrisk is the potential loss in value, due to\nprice risk and defaults, within the firm\u2019s\ncredit correlation positions; and \u2022 Specific\nrisk is the risk of loss on a position that\ncould result from factors other than broad\nmarket movements, including event risk,\ndefault risk and idiosyncratic risk. The\nstandardized measurement method is used to\ndetermine specific risk RWAs, by applying\nsupervisory defined risk-weighting factors\nafter applicable netting is performed.\n                                           \n  79    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Income Taxes Provision for Income\nTaxes Income taxes are provided for using the\nasset and liability method under which\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. The firm reports\ninterest expense related to income tax matters\nin provision for taxes and income tax\npenalties in other expenses. Deferred Income\nTaxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net\ntax effects of temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. These temporary\ndifferences result in taxable or deductible\namounts in future years and are measured using\nthe tax rates and laws that will be in effect\nwhen such differences are expected to reverse.\nValuation allowances are established to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount that more\nlikely than not will be realized and primarily\nrelate to the ability to utilize losses and\ntax credits in various tax jurisdictions. Tax\nassets are included in other assets and tax\nliabilities are included in other liabilities.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits The firm recognizes\ntax positions in the consolidated financial\nstatements only when it is more likely than\nnot that the position will be sustained on\nexamination by the relevant taxing authority\nbased on the technical merits of the position.\nA position that meets this standard is\nmeasured at the largest amount of benefit that\nwill more likely than not be realized on\nsettlement. A liability is established for\ndifferences between positions taken in a tax\nreturn and amounts recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Regulatory\nTax Examinations The firm is subject to\nexamination by the U.S. Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) and other taxing authorities in\njurisdictions where the firm has significant\nbusiness operations, such as the United\nKingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states,\nsuch as New York. The tax years under\nexamination vary by jurisdiction. The firm\ndoes not expect completion of these audits to\nhave a material impact on the firm\u2019s financial\ncondition, but it may be material to operating\nresults for a particular period, depending, in\npart, on the operating results for that\nperiod.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    84  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Business Segments The firm manages\nand reports its activities in threebusiness\nsegments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset &\nWealth Management and Platform Solutions. See\nNote 1 for information about the firm\u2019s\nbusiness segments. Compensation and benefits\nexpenses in the firm\u2019s segments reflect, among\nother factors, the overall performance of the\nfirm, as well as the performance of individual\nbusinesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in\none segment of the firm\u2019s business may be\nsignificantly affected by the performance of\nthe firm\u2019s other business segments. The firm\nallocates assets (including allocations of\nglobal core liquid assets and cash, secured\nclient financing and other assets), revenues\nand expenses among the threebusiness segments.\nDue to the integrated nature of these\nsegments, estimates and judgments are made in\nallocating certain assets, revenues and\nexpenses. The allocation process is based on\nthe manner in which management currently views\nthe performance of the segments. The\nallocation of common shareholders\u2019 equity and\npreferred stock dividends to each segment is\nbased on the estimated amount of equity\nrequired to support the activities of the\nsegment under relevant regulatory capital\nrequirements. Net earnings for each segment is\ncalculated by applying the firmwide tax rate\nto each segment\u2019s pre-tax earnings.

Note 26.\nCredit Concentrations\nThe firm\u2019s\nconcentrations of\ncredit risk arise from\nits market-making,\nclient facilitation,\ninvesting,\nunderwriting, lending\nand collateralized\ntransactions, and cash\nmanagement activities,\nand may be impacted by\nchanges in economic,\nindustry or political\nfactors. These\nactivities expose the\nfirm to many different\nindustries and\ncounterparties, and\nmay also subject the\nfirm to a\nconcentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular central\nbank, counterparty,\nborrower or issuer,\nincluding sovereign\nissuers, or to a\nparticular\nclearinghouse or\nexchange. The firm\nseeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by\nactively monitoring\nexposures and\nobtaining collateral\nfrom counterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\n\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm\nconsiders when\ndetermining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts. Netting and\ncollateral agreements\npermit the firm to\noffset receivables and\npayables with such\ncounterparties and/or\nenable the firm to\nobtain collateral on\nan upfront or\ncontingent basis.

Note 27.\nLegal Proceedings The firm is involved in a\nnumber of judicial, regulatory and arbitration\nproceedings (including those described below)\nconcerning matters arising in connection with\nthe conduct of the firm\u2019s businesses. Many of\nthese proceedings are in early stages, and\nmany of these cases seek an indeterminate\namount of damages. Under ASC 450, an event is\n\u201creasonably possible\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the\nfuture event or events occurring is more than\nremote but less than likely\u201d and an event is\n\u201cremote\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the future event or\nevents occurring is slight.\u201d Thus, references\nto the upper end of the range of reasonably\npossible loss for cases in which the firm is\nable to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible loss mean the upper end of the range\nof loss for cases for which the firm believes\nthe risk of loss is more than slight.\n\nWith respect to matters described below for\nwhich management has been able to estimate a\nrange of reasonably possible loss where (i)\nactual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an\namount of money damages, (ii) the firm is\nbeing, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers\nin a securities offering and is not being\nindemnified by a party that the firm believes\nwill pay the full amount of any judgment, or\n(iii) the purchasers are demanding that the\nfirm repurchase securities, management has\nestimated the upper end of the range of\nreasonably possible loss based on (a) in the\ncase of (i), the amount of money damages\nclaimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the\ndifference between the initial sales price of\nthe securities that the firm sold in such\noffering and the estimated lowest subsequent\nprice of such securities prior to the action\nbeing commenced and (c) in the case of (iii),\nthe price that purchasers paid for the\nsecurities less the estimated value, if any,\nas of June 2024 of the relevant securities, in\neach of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking into\naccount any other factors believed to be\nrelevant to the particular matter or matters\nof that type. As o f the date hereof, the firm\nhas estimated the upper end of the range of\nreasonably possible aggregate loss for su ch\nmatters and for any other matters described\nbelow where management has been able to\nestimate a range of reasonably possible\naggregate loss to be approximately $\n2.1billion in excess of the aggregate reserves\nfor such matters. Management is generally\nunable to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible loss for matters other than those\nincluded in the estimate above, including\nwhere (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have\nnot claimed an amount of money damages, except\nin those instances where management can\notherwise determine an appropriate amount,\n(ii) matters are in early stages, (iii)\nmatters relate to regulatory investigations or\nreviews, except in those instances where\nmanagement can otherwise determine an\nappropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty\nas to the likelihood of a class being\ncertified or the ultimate size of the class,\n(v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of\npending appeals or motions, (vi) there are\nsignificant factual issues to be resolved,\nand/or (vii) there are novel legal issues\npresented. For example, the firm\u2019s potential\nliabilities with respect to the investigations\nand reviews described below in \u201cRegulatory\nInvestigations and Reviews and Related\nLitigation\u201d generally are not included in\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible\nloss. However, management does not believe,\nbased on currently available information, that\nthe outcomes of such other matters will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the firm\u2019s\nfinancial condition, though the outcomes could\nbe material to the firm\u2019s operating results\nfor any particular period, depending, in part,\nupon the operating results for such period.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    88  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

On November 1, 2018,\nthe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed\na criminal information and guilty plea by Tim\nLeissner, a former participating managing\ndirector of the firm, and an indictment\nagainst Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing\ndirector of the firm. On August 28, 2018,\nLeissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork of conspiring to launder money and to\nviolate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct\u2019s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal\naccounting controls provisions. Ng was charged\nwith conspiring to launder money and to\nviolate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery and internal\naccounting controls provisions, and on April\n8, 2022, Ng was found guilty on all counts\nfollowing a trial. On August 18, 2020, the\nfirm announced that it entered into a\nsettlement agreement with the Government of\nMalaysia to resolve the criminal and\nregulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving\nthe firm, which includes a guarantee that the\nGovernment of Malaysia receives at least $\n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets\nseized by governmental authorities around the\nworld related to 1MDB. See Note 18 for further\ninformation about this guarantee, including\nrelated arbitration proceedings. On October\n22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached\nsettlements of governmental and regulatory\ninvestigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ,\nthe SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the Financial\nConduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation\nAuthority, the Singapore Attorney General\u2019s\nChambers, the Singapore Commercial Affairs\nDepartment, the Monetary Authority of\nSingapore and the Hong Kong Securities and\nFutures Commission. Group Inc. entered into a\nthree-year deferred prosecution agreement with\nthe DOJ, in which a charge against the firm,\none count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA,\nwas filed and was later dismissed on May 6,\n2024 in accordance with the agreement. In\naddition, GS Malaysia pleaded guilty to one\ncount of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, and\nwas sentenced on June 9, 2021. In May 2021,\nthe U.S. Department of Labor granted the firm\na five-year exemption to maintain its status\nas a qualified professional asset manager\n(QPAM).

On March 29, 2020,\nthe court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to\ndismiss and for reconsideration, resulting in\nthe dismissal of all claims, and on February\n27, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s\ndismissal of certain plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust\nclaims and vacated the district court\u2019s\ndismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 Commodity\nExchange Act claim. On April 12, 2023, the\ndefendants\u2019 petition for rehearing or\nrehearing en banc with the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit was denied.

On November 10,\n2022, the district court denied the\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for an indicative ruling\nthat the judgment should be vacated because\nthe wife of the district judge owned stock in\none of the defendants and the district judge\ndid not recuse himself. On July 2, 2024, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nvacated the district court\u2019s dismissal and\nremanded the case for further proceedings.\nCredit Default Swap Antitrust Litigation Group\nInc., GS&Co. and GSI were among the defendants\nnamed in a putative antitrust class action\nrelating to the settlement of credit default\nswaps, filed on June 30, 2021 in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of New Mexico.\nThe complaint generally asserts claims under\nfederal antitrust law and the Commodity\nExchange Act in connection with an alleged\nconspiracy among the defendants to manipulate\nthe benchmark price used to value credit\ndefault swaps for settlement.

The use of\nfair value to measure\nfinancial instruments\nis fundamental to our\nrisk management\npractices and is our\nmost critical\naccounting policy.\n\nThe fair value of a\nfinancial instrument\nis the amount that\nwould be received to\nsell an asset or paid\nto transfer a\nliability in an\norderly transaction\nbetween market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date. We\nmeasure certain\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based\non its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit\nrisks). In determining\nfair value, the\nhierarchy under U.S.\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles\n(U.S. GAAP) gives (i)\nthe highest priority\nto unadjusted quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets for identical,\nunrestricted assets or\nliabilities (level 1\ninputs), (ii) the next\npriority to inputs\nother than level 1\ninputs that are\nobservable, either\ndirectly or indirectly\n(level 2 inputs), and\n(iii) the lowest\npriority to inputs\nthat cannot be\nobserved in market\nactivity (level 3\ninputs). In evaluating\nthe significance of a\nvaluation input, we\nconsider, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s\nnet risk exposure to\nthat input. Assets and\nliabilities are\nclassified in their\nentirety based on the\nlowest level of input\nthat is significant to\ntheir fair value\nmeasurement.\n\nThe fair values for\nsubstantially all of\nour financial assets\nand liabilities are\nbased on observable\nprices and inputs and\nare classified in\nlevels 1 and 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\nCertain level 2 and\nlevel 3 financial\nassets and liabilities\nmay require\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments that a\nmarket participant\nwould require to\narrive at fair value\nfor factors, such as\ncounterparty and our\ncredit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer\nrestrictions,\nliquidity and\nbid/offer spreads.\n\nInstruments classified\nin level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy are\nthose which require\none or more\nsignificant inputs\nthat are not\nobservable. Level 3\nfinancial assets\nrepresented 1.4% as of\nboth June 2024 and\nMarch 2024, and 1.5%\nas of December 2023 of\nour total assets.

Absent\nevidence to the\ncontrary, instruments\nclassified in level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy are\ninitially valued at\ntransaction price,\nwhich is considered to\nbe the best initial\nestimate of fair\nvalue. Subsequent to\nthe transaction date,\nwe use other\nmethodologies to\ndetermine fair value,\nwhich vary based on\nthe type of\ninstrument. Estimating\nthe fair value of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstruments requires\njudgments to be made.\nThese judgments\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Determining the\nappropriate valuation\nmethodology and/or\nmodel for each type of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstrument;\n\n\u2022 Determining model\ninputs based on an\nevaluation of all\nrelevant empirical\nmarket data, including\nprices evidenced by\nmarket transactions,\ninterest rates, credit\nspreads, volatilities\nand correlations; and\n\n\u2022 Determining\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments, including\nthose related to\nilliquidity or\ncounterparty credit\nquality.\n\nRegardless of the\nmethodology, valuation\ninputs and assumptions\nare only changed when\ncorroborated by\nsubstantive evidence.\n\nControls Over\nValuation of Financial\nInstruments.

In the event\nthat there is a\ndifference of opinion\nin situations where\nestimating the fair\nvalue of financial\ninstruments requires\njudgment (e.g.,\ncalibration to market\ncomparables or trade\ncomparison, as\ndescribed below), the\nfinal valuation\ndecision is made by\nsenior managers in\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions.

The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. We\napply judgment in\nweighting individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including our\ninternally derived\neconomic outlook,\nmarket consensus,\nrecent macroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios. Risk\nfactors for wholesale\nloans include internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators (e.g.,\nunemployment rates and\nGDP), the borrower\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its\nfinancial obligations,\nthe borrower\u2019s country\nof risk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. In\naddition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nthe loan-to-value\nratio, debt service\nratio and home price\nindex. The allowance\nfor loan losses for\nwholesale loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics,\nsuch as nonaccrual\nloans, is calculated\nusing the present\nvalue of expected\nfuture cash flows\ndiscounted at the\nloan\u2019s effective rate,\nthe observable market\nprice of the loan, or,\nin the case of\ncollateral dependent\nloans, the fair value\nof the collateral less\nestimated costs to\nsell, if applicable.\nRisk factors for\ninstallment and credit\ncard loans include\nFair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators.\n\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses also\nincludes qualitative\ncomponents which allow\nmanagement to reflect\nthe uncertain nature\nof economic\nforecasting, capture\nuncertainty regarding\nmodel inputs, and\naccount for model\nimprecision and\nconcentration risk.\n\nOur estimate of credit\nlosses entails\njudgment about\ncollectability at the\nreporting dates, and\nthere are\nuncertainties inherent\nin those judgments.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses is\nsubject to a\ngovernance process\nthat involves review\nand approval by senior\nmanagement within our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions. Personnel\nwithin our independent\nrisk oversight and\ncontrol functions are\nresponsible for\nforecasting the\neconomic variables\nthat underlie the\neconomic scenarios\nthat are used in the\nmodeling of expected\ncredit losses. While\nwe use the best\ninformation available\nto determine this\nestimate, future\nadjustments to the\nallowance may be\nnecessary based on,\namong other things,\nchanges in the\neconomic environment\nor variances between\nactual results and the\noriginal assumptions\nused. Loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\n\nWe also record an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on lending\ncommitments which are\nheld for investment\nthat are accounted for\nat amortized cost.\nSuch allowance is\ndetermined using the\nsame methodology as\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses, while also\ntaking into\nconsideration the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding,\nand whether such\ncommitments are\ncancellable by us.\n\nTo estimate the\npotential impact of an\nadverse macroeconomic\nenvironment on our\nallowance for credit\nlosses, we, among\nother things, compared\nthe expected credit\nlosses under the\nweighted average\nforecast used in the\ncalculation of\nallowance for credit\nlosses as of June 2024\n(which was weighted\ntowards the baseline\nand adverse economic\nscenarios) to the\nexpected credit losses\nunder a 100% weighted\nadverse economic\nscenario. The adverse\neconomic scenario of\nthe forecast model\nreflects a global\nrecession in the\nsecond half of 2024\nthrough the first half\nof 2025, resulting in\nan economic\ncontraction and rising\nunemployment rates. A\n100% weighting to the\nadverse economic\nscenario would have\nresulted in an\napproximate $0.6\nbillion increase in\nour allowance for\ncredit losses as of\nJune 2024. This\nhypothetical increase\ndoes not take into\nconsideration any\npotential adjustments\nto qualitative\nreserves. The\nforecasts of\nmacroeconomic\nconditions are\ninherently uncertain\nand do not take into\naccount any other\noffsetting or\ncorrelated effects.\nThe actual credit loss\nin an adverse\nmacroeconomic\nenvironment may differ\nsignificantly from\nthis estimate. See\nNote 9 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about the\nallowance for credit\nlosses.\n                                              \n  Use of Estimates                            \n                                              \nU.S. GAAP requires us\nto make certain\nestimates and\nassumptions. In\naddition to the\nestimates we make in\nconnection with fair\nvalue measurements and\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses on loans\nand lending\ncommitments held for\ninvestment and\naccounted for at\namortized cost, the\nuse of estimates and\nassumptions is also\nimportant in\ndetermining\ndiscretionary\ncompensation accruals,\nthe accounting for\ngoodwill and\nidentifiable\nintangible assets,\nprovisions for losses\nthat may arise from\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\n(including\ngovernmental\ninvestigations), and\naccounting for income\ntaxes.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    108  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In addition\nto the level of net\nrevenues net of\nprovision for credit\nlosses, our overall\ncompensation expense\nin any given year is\nalso influenced by,\namong other factors,\noverall financial\nperformance,\nprevailing labor\nmarkets, business mix,\nthe structure of our\nshare-based\ncompensation programs\nand the external\nenvironment.\n\nGoodwill is assessed\nfor impairment\nannually in the fourth\nquarter or more\nfrequently if events\noccur or circumstances\nchange that indicate\nan impairment may\nexist. When assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its carrying\nvalue. If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment. Estimating\nthe fair value of our\nreporting units\nrequires judgment.\nCritical inputs to the\nfair value estimates\ninclude projected\nearnings, allocated\nequity, price-to-\nearnings multiples and\nprice-to-book\nmultiples. There is\ninherent uncertainty\nin the projected\nearnings. The carrying\nvalue of each\nreporting unit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nSee Note 12 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\nannual assessment of\ngoodwill for\nimpairment. If we\nexperience a prolonged\nor severe period of\nweakness in the\nbusiness environment,\nfinancial markets, the\nperformance of one or\nmore of our reporting\nunits or our common\nstock price, or\nadditional increases\nin capital\nrequirements, our\ngoodwill could be\nimpaired in the\nfuture.\n\nIdentifiable\nintangible assets are\ntested for impairment\nwhen events or changes\nin circumstances\nsuggest that an\nasset\u2019s or asset\ngroup\u2019s carrying value\nmay not be fully\nrecoverable. Judgment\nis required to\nevaluate whether\nindications of\npotential impairment\nhave occurred, and to\ntest identifiable\nintangible assets for\nimpairment, if\nrequired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated undiscounted\ncash flows relating to\nthe asset or asset\ngroup is less than the\ncorresponding carrying\nvalue. See Note 12 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about\nidentifiable\nintangible assets.\n\nWe also estimate and\nprovide for potential\nlosses that may arise\nout of litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nto the extent that\nsuch losses are\nprobable and can be\nreasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we\nestimate the upper end\nof the range of\nreasonably possible\naggregate loss in\nexcess of the related\nreserves for\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nwhere we believe the\nrisk of loss is more\nthan slight. See Notes\n18 and 27 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for\ninformation about\ncertain judicial,\nlitigation and\nregulatory\nproceedings.\nSignificant judgment\nis required in making\nthese estimates and\nour final liabilities\nmay ultimately be\nmaterially different.\nOur total estimated\nliability in respect\nof litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nis determined on a\ncase-by-case basis and\nrepresents an estimate\nof probable losses\nafter considering,\namong other factors,\nthe progress of each\ncase, proceeding or\ninvestigation, our\nexperience and the\nexperience of others\nin similar cases,\nproceedings or\ninvestigations, and\nthe opinions and views\nof legal counsel.\n\nIn accounting for\nincome taxes, we\nrecognize tax\npositions in the\nfinancial statements\nonly when it is more\nlikely than not that\nthe position will be\nsustained on\nexamination by the\nrelevant taxing\nauthority based on the\ntechnical merits of\nthe position.

The\nincrease compared with\n21.1% for the first\nquarter of 2024 was\nprimarily due to a\ndecrease in the impact\nof permanent tax\nbenefits. The\nOrganisation for\nEconomic Co-operation\nand Development (OECD)\nGlobal Anti-Base\nErosion Model Rules\n(Pillar II) aim to\nensure that\nmultinationals with\nrevenues in excess of\nEUR 750 million pay a\nminimum effective\ncorporate tax rate of\n15% (minimum tax) in\neach jurisdiction in\nwhich they operate.\nThe U.K. and other\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate have\nadopted certain\nportions of the OECD\ndirective (Pillar II\nlegislation) effective\nbeginning in calendar\nyear 2024. The Pillar\nII legislation did not\nhave a material impact\non our effective tax\nrate for the first\nhalf of 2024 and we do\nnot expect a material\nimpact on our 2024\nannual effective tax\nrate based on our\ncurrent interpretation\nof the guidance\npublished by the OECD\nand enacted\nlegislation. We expect\nadditional guidance or\nlegislation to be\nissued by the OECD and\nvarious jurisdictions\nin the second half of\n2024 which could\nimpact any minimum tax\nwe owe in future\nperiods, possibly\nmaterially, and our\neffective tax rate\ncould increase in 2025\nand thereafter.

Due to the\nintegrated nature of\nour market-making\nactivities,\ndisaggregation of net\nrevenues into client\nactivity and market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges is judgmental\nand has inherent\ncomplexities and\nlimitations.

During the second\nquarter of 2024, Asset & Wealth Management\noperated in an environment generally\ncharacterized by continued broad macroeconomic\nconcerns, including persistent concerns about\nthe commercial real estate market. However,\nglobal equity prices were generally higher\ncompared with the end of the first quarter of\n2024, positively affecting assets under\nsupervision. In the future, if market and\neconomic conditions deteriorate, it may lead\nto a decline in asset prices, or investors\ntransitioning to asset classes that typically\ngenerate lower fees or withdrawing their\nassets, and net revenues in Asset & Wealth\nManagement would likely be negatively\nimpacted. Three Months Ended June 2024 versus\nJune 2023. Net revenues in Asset & Wealth\nManagement were $3.88 billion f or the second\nquarter of 2024, 27% higher than the second\nquarter of 2023, reflecting net gains in\nEquity investments compared with net losses in\nthe prior year period, higher Management and\nother fees and higher net revenues in Debt\ninvestments, partially offset by lower net\nrevenues in Private Banking and lending. The\nincrease in Equity investments net revenues\nprimarily reflected net gains from real estate\ninvestments compared with significant net\nlosses in the prior year period. The increase\nin Management and other fees primarily\nreflected the impact of higher average assets\nunder supervision. The increase in Debt\ninvestments net revenues reflected\nsignificantly lower net losses from real\nestate investments, partially offset by\nsignificantly lower net interest income due to\na reduction in the Debt investments balance\nsheet. The decrease in Private banking and\nlending net revenues reflected the impact of\nthe sale of the Marcus loans portfolio in 2023\n(including a gain of approximately $100\nmillion related to the sale of substantially\nall of the remaining portfolio in the second\nquarter of 2023). Provision for credit losses\nwas a net benefit of $58 million for the\nsecond quarter of 2024, compared with a net\nprovision of $15 million for the second\nquarter of 2023. The net benefit for the\nsecond quarter of 2024 reflected a reserve\nreduction related to sales and paydowns.\nProvisions for the second quarter of 2023\nreflected impairments on wholesale loans,\noffset by a reserve reduction related to sales\nand paydowns. Operating expenses were $3.04\nbillion for the second quarter of 2024, 7%\nlower than the second quarter of 2023, due to\nsignificantly lower impairments related to\ncommercial real estate in CIEs, partially\noffset by higher compensation and benefits\nexpenses (reflecting improved operating\nperformance). Pre-tax earnings were $899\nmillion for the second quarter of 2024,\ncompared with a pre-tax loss of $243 million\nfor the second quarter of 2023.\n                                            \n  121    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nincrease in Private\nbanking and lending\nnet revenues primarily\nreflected the impact\nof the sale of the\nMarcus loans portfolio\nin 2023 (including net\nrevenues of\napproximately $(370)\nmillion related to the\nsale of substantially\nall of the portfolio\nin the first half of\n2023). Debt\ninvestments net\nrevenues were higher,\nreflecting\nsignificantly lower\nnet losses from real\nestate investments,\npartially offset by\nsignificantly lower\nnet interest income\ndue to a reduction in\nthe Debt investments\nbalance sheet.\nProvision for credit\nlosses was a net\nbenefit of $80 million\nfor the first half of\n2024, compared with a\nnet benefit of $550\nmillion for the first\nhalf of 2023. The net\nbenefit for the first\nhalf of 2024 reflected\na reserve reduction\nrelated to sales and\npaydowns. The net\nbenefit for the first\nhalf of 2023 reflected\nreserve reductions\nrelated to the sale of\nsubstantially all of\nthe Marcus loans\nportfolio (a reduction\nof approximately $440\nmillion), as well as\nother sales and\npaydowns. Operating\nexpenses were $5.97\nbillion for the first\nhalf of 2024, 7% lower\nthan the first half of\n2023, due to\nsignificantly lower\nimpairments related to\ncommercial real estate\nin CIEs, partially\noffset by higher\ncompensation and\nbenefits expenses\n(reflecting improved\noperating\nperformance).

The operating\nenvironment for Platform Solutions is mainly\nimpacted by the economic environment in the\nU.S., which, during the second quarter of\n2024, was generally characterized by concerns\nabout inflation, a slightly higher but\ncontinued low rate of unemployment and a\nslight increase in the pace of growth in\nconsumer spending compared with the first\nquarter of 2024. In the future, if economic\nconditions deteriorate, it may lead to a\ndecrease in consumer spending or a\ndeterioration in consumer credit, and net\nrevenues and provision for credit losses in\nPlatform Solutions would likely be negatively\nimpacted. Three Months Ended June 2024 ve rsus\nJune 2023. Net revenues in Platform Solutions\nwere $669 million for the second quarter of\n2024, 2% higher than the second quarter of\n2023.\n\nNotwithstanding our strategic decision to\nnarrow our focus on consumer-related\nactivities, Consumer platforms net revenues\nwere slightly higher, reflecting higher\naverage credit card balances and higher\naverage deposit balances, largely offset by\nthe impact of the sale of GreenSky in the\nfirst quarter of 2024. Transaction banking and\nother net revenues were lower, reflecting\nlower average deposit balances. See\n\u201cRegulatory and Other Matters \u2014 Other Matters\n\u2014 Narrowing our Focus on Consumer-Related\nActivities\u201d for further information. Provision\nfor credit losses was $395 million for the\nsecond quarter of 2024, compared with $544\nmillion for the second quarter of 2023.\nProvisions for the second quarter of 2024\nreflected net charge-offs related to the\ncredit card portfolio. Provisions for the\nsecond quarter of 2023 primarily reflected net\ncharge-offs related to the credit card\nportfolio and growth in the point-of-sale\nloans portfolio. Operating expenses wer e $421\nmillion for the second quarter of 2024, 57%\nlower than the second quarter of 2023, largely\ndue to an impairment of goodwill related to\nConsumer platforms in the prior year period.\nPre-tax loss was $147 million for the second\nquarter of 2024, compared with a pre-tax loss\nof $872 million for the second quarter of\n2023. Six Months Ended June 2024 versus June\n2023. Net revenues in Platform Solutions were\n$1.37 billion for the first half of 2024, 12%\nhigher than the first half of 2023.\nNotwithstanding our strategic decision to\nnarrow our focus on consumer-related\nactivities, Consumer platforms net revenues\nwere higher, reflecting higher average credit\ncard balances and higher average deposit\nbalances, partially offset by the impact of\nthe sale of GreenSky in the first quarter of\n2024.

Provision for credit\nlosses was $639 million for the first half of\n2024, compared with $809 million for the first\nhalf of 2023. Provisions for the first half of\n2024 reflected net charge-offs related to the\ncredit card portfolio. Provisions for the\nfirst half of 2023 primarily reflected net\ncharge-offs related to the credit card\nportfolio and growth in the point-of-sale\nloans portfolio, partially offset by reserve\nreleases based on actual repayment experience.\nOperating expenses were $992 million for the\nfirst half of 2024, 38% lower than the first\nhalf of 2023, largely due to an impairment of\ngoodwill related to Consumer platforms in the\nprior year period. Pre-tax loss was $264\nmillion for the first half of 2024, compared\nwith a pre-tax loss of $1.18 billion for the\nfirst half of 2023.

We\nfund a significant\namount of inventory\nand a portion of\ninvestments on a\nsecured basis. Secured\nfunding includes\ncollateralized\nfinancings in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets. See Note 11 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about our\ncollateralized\nfinancings, including\nits maturity profile.\nWe may also pledge our\ninventory and\ninvestments as\ncollateral for\nsecurities borrowed\nunder a securities\nlending agreement. We\nalso use our own\ninventory and\ninvestments to cover\ntransactions in which\nwe or our clients have\nsold securities that\nhave not yet been\npurchased. Secured\nfunding is less\nsensitive to changes\nin our credit quality\nthan unsecured\nfunding, due to our\nposting of collateral\nto our lenders.\nNonetheless, we\nanalyze the\nrefinancing risk of\nour secured funding\nactivities, taking\ninto account trade\ntenors, maturity\nprofiles, counterparty\nconcentrations,\ncollateral eligibility\nand counterparty\nrollover\nprobabilities. We seek\nto mitigate our\nrefinancing risk by\nexecuting term trades\nwith staggered\nmaturities,\ndiversifying\ncounterparties,\nraising excess secured\nfunding and pre-\nfunding residual risk\nthrough our GCLA. We\nseek to raise secured\nfunding with a term\nappropriate for the\nliquidity of the\nassets that are being\nfinanced, and we seek\nlonger maturities for\nsecured funding\ncollateralized by\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis,\nespecially during\ntimes of market\nstress. Our secured\nfunding, excluding\nfunding collateralized\nby liquid government\nand agency\nobligations, is\nprimarily executed for\ntenors of one month or\ngreater and is\nprimarily executed\nthrough term\nrepurchase agreements\nand securities loaned\ncontracts. Assets that\nmay be harder to fund\non a secured basis\nduring times of market\nstress include certain\nfinancial instruments\nin the following\ncategories: mortgage-\nand other asset-backed\nloans and securities,\nnon-investment-grade\ncorporate debt\nsecurities, equity\nsecurities and\nemerging market\nsecurities. We also\nraise financing\nthrough other types of\ncollateralized\nfinancings, such as\nsecured loans and\nnotes. GS Bank USA has\naccess to funding from\nthe Federal Home Loan\nBank. Our outstanding\nborrowings from the\nFederal Home Loan Bank\nwere $5.04 billion as\nof June 2024 and we\nhad no outstanding\nborrowings as of\nDecember 2023.\nAdditionally, we have\naccess to funding\nthrough the Federal\nReserve discount\nwindow, but we do not\nrely on this funding\nin our liquidity\nplanning and stress\ntesting.\n\nUnsecured Short-Term\nBorrowings. A\nsignificant portion of\nour unsecured short-\nterm borrowings was\noriginally long-term\ndebt that is scheduled\nto mature within one\nyear of the reporting\ndate. We use unsecured\nshort-term borrowings,\nincluding U.S. and\nnon-U.S. hybrid\nfinancial instruments\nand commercial paper,\nto finance liquid\nassets and for other\ncash management\npurposes. In\naccordance with\nregulatory\nrequirements, Group\nInc. does not issue\ndebt with an original\nmaturity of less than\none year, other than\nto its subsidiaries.\nSee Note 14 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\nunsecured short-term\nborrowings. Unsecured\nLong-Term Borrowings.\nUnsecured long-term\nborrowings, including\nstructured notes, are\nraised through\nsyndicated U.S.\nregistered offerings,\nU.S. registered and\nRule 144A medium-term\nnote programs,\noffshore medium-term\nnote offerings and\nother debt offerings.\nWe issue in different\ntenors, currencies and\nproducts to maximize\nthe diversification of\nour investor base.

As part of\ncapital planning, we\nproject sources and\nuses of capital given\na range of business\nenvironments,\nincluding stressed\nconditions. Our stress\ntesting process is\ndesigned to identify\nand measure material\nrisks associated with\nour business\nactivities, including\nmarket risk, credit\nrisk, operational risk\nand liquidity risk, as\nwell as our ability to\ngenerate revenues.\n\nOur capital planning\nprocess incorporates\nan internal capital\nadequacy assessment\nwith the objective of\nensuring that we are\nappropriately\ncapitalized relative\nto the risks in our\nbusinesses. We\nincorporate stress\nscenarios into our\ncapital planning\nprocess with a goal of\nholding sufficient\ncapital to ensure we\nremain adequately\ncapitalized after\nexperiencing a severe\nstress event. Our\nassessment of capital\nadequacy is viewed in\ntandem with our\nassessment of\nliquidity adequacy and\nis integrated into our\noverall risk\nmanagement structure,\ngovernance and policy\nframework.\n\nOur stress tests\nincorporate our\ninternally designed\nstress scenarios,\nincluding our\ninternally developed\nseverely adverse\nscenario, and those\nrequired by the FRB,\nand are designed to\ncapture our specific\nvulnerabilities and\nrisks. We provide\nfurther information\nabout our stress test\nprocesses and a\nsummary of the results\non our website as\ndescribed in\n\u201cAvailable\nInformation.\u201d\n\nAs required by the\nFRB\u2019s CCAR rules, we\nsubmit an annual\ncapital plan for\nreview by the FRB. The\npurpose of the FRB\u2019s\nreview is to ensure\nthat we have a robust,\nforward-looking\ncapital planning\nprocess that accounts\nfor our unique risks\nand that permits\ncontinued operation\nduring times of\neconomic and financial\nstress.\n\nThe FRB evaluates us\nbased, in part, on\nwhether we have the\ncapital necessary to\ncontinue operating\nunder the baseline and\nseverely adverse\nscenarios provided by\nthe FRB and those\ndeveloped internally.\nThis evaluation also\ntakes into account our\nprocess for\nidentifying risk, our\ncontrols and\ngovernance for capital\nplanning, and our\nguidelines for making\ncapital planning\ndecisions. In\naddition, the FRB\nevaluates our plan to\nmake capital\ndistributions (i.e.,\ndividend payments and\nrepurchases or\nredemptions of stock,\nsubordinated debt or\nother capital\nsecurities) and issue\ncapital, across the\nrange of macroeconomic\nscenarios and firm-\nspecific assumptions.\nThe FRB determines the\nstress capital buffer\n(SCB) applicable to us\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\nThe SCB under the\nStandardized approach\nis calculated as (i)\nthe difference between\nour starting and\nminimum projected CET1\ncapital ratios under\nthe supe rvisory\nseverely adverse\nscenario and (ii) our\nplanned common stock\ndividends for each of\nthe fourth through\nseventh quarters of\nthe planning horizon,\nexpressed as a\npercentage of risk-\nweighted assets\n(RWAs).\n\nBased on our 2024 CCAR\nsubmission, the FRB\nhas preliminarily\nincreased our SCB from\n5.5% to 6.4% for the\nperiod from October 1,\n2024 through September\n30, 2025, resulting in\na Standardized CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement of 13.9%.\nThe FRB has until\nAugust 31, 2024 to\nfinalize the SCB.

This\nframework considers\nmany factors,\nincluding our internal\nassessment of risks as\nwell as the regulatory\ncapital requirements\nrelated to our\nbusiness activities .\n\nWe review and make any\nnecessary adjustments\nto our attributed\nequity in January each\nyear, to reflect,\namong other things,\nour most recent stress\ntest results and\nchanges to our\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. On\nJanuary 1, 2024, our\nallocation of\nattributed equity\nchanged (relative to\nthe allocation as of\nDecember 2023) as\nfollows: attributed\nequity increased by\napproximately $1.6\nbillion for Platform\nSolutions, while\nattributed equity\ndecreased by\napproximately $1.2\nbillion for Asset &\nWealth Management and\napproximately $0.4\nbillion for Global\nBanking & Markets. See\n\u201cResults of Operations\n\u2014 Segment Assets and\nOperating Results \u2014\nSegment Operating\nResults\u201d for\ninformation about our\naverage quarterly\nattributed equity by\nsegment.\n\nShare Repur chase\nProgram. We use our\nshare repurchase\nprogram to help\nmaintain the\nappropriate level of\ncommon equity. On an\nannual basis, we\nsubmit a Board of\nDirectors of Group\nInc. ( Board) approved\ncapital plan to the\nFederal Reserve, which\nincludes planned share\nrepurchases for each\nquarter. The share\nrepurchases are\neffected primarily\nthrough regular open-\nmarket purchases\n(which may include\nrepurchase plans\ndesigned to comply\nwith Rule 10b5-1 and\naccelerated share\nrepurchases), the\namounts and timing of\nwhich are determined\nprimarily by our\ncurrent and projected\ncapital position, and\ncapital deployment\nopportunities, but\nwhich may also be\ninfluenced by general\nmarket conditions and\nthe prevailing price\nand trading volumes of\nour common stock.\n\nIn February 2023, the\nBoard approved a share\nrepurchase program\nauthorizing\nrepurchases of up to\n$30 billion of our\ncommon stock. The\nprogram has no set\nexpiration or\ntermination date. See\n\u201cUnregistered Sales of\nEquity Securities and\nUse of Proceeds\u201d in\nPart II, Item 2 of\nthis Form 10-Q and\nNote 19 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\nshare repurchase\nprogram, and see above\nfor information about\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess.\n\nDuring the second\nquarter of 2024, we\nreturned a total of\n$4.43 billion of\ncapital to common\nshareholders,\nincluding $3.50\nbillion of common\nshare repurchases and\n$929 million of common\nstock dividends. The\nBoard approved an\nincrease in our\nquarterly common stock\ndividend from $2.75 to\n$3.00 per share\nbeginning in the third\nquarter of 2024. Given\nthe increase in our\nSCB requirement, we\nplan to moderate our\nstock repurchase\nlevels relative to the\nsecond quarter of\n2024. Consistent with\nour capital management\nphilosophy, we will\ncontinue prioritizing\ndeployment of capital\nfor our clients where\nreturns are attractive\nand distribute any\nexcess capital to\nshareholders through\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, while\ntargeting a 50 to 100\nbasis point buffer\nabove our capital\nrequirement.\n\nWe are subject to a\none percent non-\ndeductible federal\nexcise tax (buyback\ntax) that is\napplicable to the fair\nmarket value of\ncertain corporate\nshare repurchases. The\nfair market value of\nshare repurchases\nsubject to the tax is\nreduced by the fair\nmarket value of any\napplicable stock\nissued during the\ncalendar year,\nincluding stock issued\nto employees. The\nbuyback tax did not\nhave a material impact\non our financial\ncondition, results of\noperations or cash\nflows for either the\nthree or six months\nended June 2024.\n\nResolution Capital\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established a\nResolution Capital\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich is designed to\nensure that our major\nsubsidiaries (GS Bank\nUSA, Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI,\nGSIB, GSBE, Goldman\nSachs Japan Co., Ltd.\n(GSJCL), Goldman Sachs\nAsset Management, L.P.\nand Goldman Sachs\nAsset Management\nInternational) have\naccess to sufficient\nloss-absorbing\ncapacity (in the form\nof equity,\nsubordinated debt and\nunsecured senior debt)\nso that they are able\nto wind down following\na Group Inc.\nbankruptcy filing in\naccordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIn addition, we have\nestablished a triggers\nand alerts framework,\nwhich is designed to\nprovide the Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc.\n                                            \n  133    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

GS Bank USA,\nGSIB and GSBE have\nalso been assigned\nlong- and short-term\nissuer ratings, as\nwell as ratings on\ntheir long- and short-\nterm bank deposits. In\naddition, credit\nrating agencies have\nassigned ratings to\ndebt obligations of\ncertain other\nsubsidiaries of Group\nInc. The level and\ncomposition of our\ncapital are among the\nmany factors\nconsidered in\ndetermining our credit\nratings. Each agency\nhas its own definition\nof eligible capital\nand methodology for\nevaluating capital\nadequacy, and\nassessments are\ngenerally based on a\ncombination of factors\nrather than a single\ncalculation.

As of June 2024,\nour most binding\ncapital constraint was\nthe supplementary\nleverage ratio\nrequirement. The\ncapital requirements\ncalculated under the\nCapital Framework\ninclude the capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements, which\nare comprised of a\n2.5% buffer (under the\nAdvanced Capital\nRules), the SCB (under\nthe Standardized\nCapital Rules), a\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer (under\nboth Capital Rules)\nand the G-SIB\nsurcharge (under both\nCapital Rules). Our\nG-SIB surcharge is\n3.0% for both 2024 and\n2025. Based on\nfinancial data for\n2023, we are in the\n3.5% G-SIB surcharge\nthreshold range. The\nearliest this\nsurcharge could be\neffective is January\n2026. The G-SIB\nsurcharge and\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer in the\nfuture may differ due\nto additional guidance\nfrom our regulators\nand/or positional\nchanges, and our SCB\nis likely to change\nfrom year to year\nbased on the results\nof the annual\nsupervisory stress\ntests. Our target is\nto maintain capital\nratios equal to the\nregulatory\nrequirements plus a\nbuffer of 50 to 100\nbasis points. See Note\n20 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about our\nrisk-based capital\nratios and leverage\nratios, and the\nCapital Framework.\n\nTotal Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity (TLAC) We are\nalso subject to the\nFRB\u2019s TLAC and related\nrequirements. Failure\nto comply with the\nTLAC and related\nrequirements would\nresult in restrictions\nbeing imposed by the\nFRB and could limit\nour ability to\nrepurchase shares, pay\ndividends and make\ncertain discretionary\ncompensation payments.\nThe table below\npresents TLAC and\nexternal long-term\ndebt requirements.\n                                              \n               As of                          \n                      June          December  \n                      2024              2023  \n  TLAC to       22.0     %    22.0         %  \n  RWAs                                        \n  TLAC to                                     \n  leverage       9.5     %     9.5         %  \n  exposure                                    \n  External                                    \n  long-term      9.0     %     9.0         %  \n  debt to                                     \n  RWAs                                        \n  External                                    \n  long-term                                   \n  debt to        4.5     %     4.5         %  \n  leverage                                    \n  exposure                                    \n                                              \nIn the table above: \u2022\nThe TLAC to RWAs\nrequirement included\n(i) the 18% minimum,\n(ii) the 2.5% buffer,\n(iii) the\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer, which\nthe FRB has set to\nzero percent and (iv)\nthe 1.5% G-SIB\nsurcharge (Method 1).\n\u2022 The TLAC to leverage\nexposure requirement\nincludes (i) the 7.5%\nminimum and (ii) the\n2.0% leverage exposure\nbuffer. \u2022 The external\nlong-term debt to RWAs\nrequirement includes\n(i) the 6% minimum and\n(ii) the 3.0% G-SIB\nsurcharge (Method 2).\n\u2022 The external long-\nterm debt to total\nleverage exposure is\nthe 4.5% minimum.

GSI is a registered swap dealer with\nthe CFTC and a registered security-based swap\ndealer with the SEC. As of both June 2024 and\nDecember 2023, GSI was subject to and in\ncompliance with applicable capital\nrequirements for swap dealers and security-\nbased swap dealers. GSJCL, our Japanese\nbroker-dealer, is regulated by Japan\u2019s\nFinancial Services Agency. GSJCL and certain\nother non-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject\nto capital requirements promulgated by\nauthorities of the countries in which they\noperate. As of both June 2024 and December\n2023, these subsidiaries were in compliance\nwith their local capital requirements.\n\nRegulatory and Other Matters Regulatory\nMatters Our businesses are subject to\nextensive regulation and supervision\nworldwide. Regulations have been adopted or\nare being considered by regulators and policy\nmakers worldwide. Given that many of the new\nand proposed rules are highly complex, the\nfull impact of regulatory reform will not be\nknown until the rules are implemented and\nmarket practices develop under the final\nregulations. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in\nPart I, Item 1 of the 2023 Form 10-K for\nfurther information about the laws, rules and\nregulations and proposed laws, rules and\nregulations that apply to us and our\noperations. Resolution Plan. We are required\nby the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC to\nsubmit a periodic plan that describes our\nstrategy for a rapid and orderly resolution in\nthe event of material financial distress or\nfailure (resolution plan). In June 2024, the\nFederal Reserve Board and the FDIC provided\nfeedback on our 2023 resolution plan and\nidentified one shortcoming, other areas for\nadditional focus to address resolution\nreadiness and additional information required\nto be included in our 2025 resolution plan. We\nare required to submit a description of our\nkey actions to address the shortcoming by\nSeptember 2024. See \u201cAvailable Information\u201d\nfor information about the public portion of\nour resolution plan sub mission. Other Matters\nNarrowing our Focus on Consumer-Related\nActivities. During 2023, we made a strategic\ndecision to narrow our focus with respect to\nconsumer-related activities and took the\nfollowing actions: \u2022 We completed the sale of\nsubstantially all of the Marcus loans\nportfolio in 2023 (included within Asset &\nWealth Management). \u2022 We sold our Personal\nFinancial Management (PFM) business in 2023\n(included within Asset & Wealth Management). \u2022\nWe sold the majority of the GreenSky\ninstallment loan portfolio in 2023 and, during\nthe first quarter of 2024, completed the sale\nof GreenSky (included within Platform\nSolutions). \u2022 During the fourth quarter of\n2023, we entered into an agreement with\nGeneral Motors (GM) regarding a process to\ntransition the GM credit card program to\nanother issuer to be selected by GM and\nconsequently classified the loan portfolio as\nheld for sale (included within Platform\nSolutions). We remain committed to supporting\nthe products and servicing customers through\nthe various transition arrangements for our\nconsumer-related activities.\n                                            \n  137    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See \u201cResults\nof Operations \u2014\nPlatform Solutions\u201d\nfor the drivers of\nchanges in our net\nrevenues for Consumer\nplatforms. The\nEnhancement and\nStandardization of\nClimate-Related\nDisclosures for\nInvestors . In March\n2024, the SEC adopted\nfinal rules requiring\nregistrants to provide\ncertain climate-\nrelated disclosures,\nincluding Scope 1 and\nScope 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions to the\nextent they are\nmaterial. These rules\nrequire certain\ndisclosures related to\nsevere weather events\nand other natural\nconditions in the\nnotes to audited\nfinancial statements.\nThese disclosures are\nrequired to be phased-\nin over multiple years\nbeginning with fiscal\nyear 2025 for large\naccelerated filers\nlike us. However, the\nSEC has stayed the\nimplementation of\nthese rules, pending\nthe outcome of\nlitigation challenging\nthe rules.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet\nArrangements In the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, we enter\ninto various types of\noff-balance sheet\narrangements. Our\ninvolvement in these\narrangements can take\nmany different forms,\nincluding: \u2022\nPurchasing or\nretaining residual and\nother interests in\nspecial purpose\nentities, such as\nmortgage-backed and\nother asset-backed\nsecuritization\nvehicles; \u2022 Holding\nsenior and\nsubordinated debt,\ninterests in limited\nand general\npartnerships, and\npreferred and common\nstock in other\nnonconsolidated\nvehicles; \u2022 Entering\ninto interest rate,\nforeign currency,\nequity, commodity and\ncredit derivatives,\nincluding total return\nswaps; and \u2022 Providing\nguarantees,\nindemnifications,\ncommitments, letters\nof credit and\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. We enter\ninto these\narrangements for a\nvariety of business\npurposes, including\nsecuritizations. The\nsecuritization\nvehicles that purchase\nmortgages, corporate\nbonds and other types\nof financial assets\nare critical to the\nfunctioning of several\nsignificant investor\nmarkets, including the\nmortgage-backed and\nother asset-backed\nsecurities markets,\nsince they offer\ninvestors access to\nspecific cash flows\nand risks created\nthrough the\nsecuritization\nprocess. We also enter\ninto these\narrangements to\nunderwrite client\nsecuritization\ntransactions; provide\nsecondary market\nliquidity; make\ninvestments in\nperforming and\nnonperforming debt,\ndistressed loans,\npower-related assets,\nequity securities,\nreal estate and other\nassets; and provide\ninvestors with credit-\nlinked and asset-\nrepackaged notes.

Our risk\nmanagement structure\nis built around three\ncore components:\ngovernance, processes\nand people.\n\nGovernance. Risk\nmanagement governance\nstarts with the Board,\nwhich both directly\nand through its\ncommittees, including\nits Risk Committee,\noversees our risk\nmanagement policies\nand practices\nimplemented through\nthe enterprise risk\nmanagement framework.\nThe Board is also\nresponsible for the\nannual review and\napproval of our risk\nappetite statement.\nThe risk appetite\nstatement describes\nthe levels and types\nof risk we are willing\nto accept or to avoid\nin order to achieve\nour objectives\nincluded in our\nstrategic business\nplan, while remaining\nin compliance with\nregulatory\nrequirements. The\nBoard reviews our\nstrategic business\nplan and is ultimately\nresponsible for\noverseeing and\nproviding direction\nabout our strategy and\nrisk appetite.\n\nThe Board, including\nthrough its\ncommittees, receives\nregular briefings on\nfirmwide risks,\nincluding liquidity\nrisk, market risk,\ncredit risk,\noperational risk,\ncybersecurity risk,\nmodel risk and climate\nrisk, from our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions, including\nour chief risk\nofficer, on\ncybersecurity threats\nand risks from our\nchief information\nsecurity officer\n(CISO), on compliance\nrisk and conduct risk\nfrom our chief\ncompliance officer, on\nlegal and regulatory\nenforcement matters\nfrom our chief legal\nofficer, and on other\nmatters impacting our\nreputation from the\nchair and/or vice-\nchairs of our Firmwide\nReputational Risk\nCommittee. The chief\nrisk officer reports\nto our chief executive\nofficer and to the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard. As part of the\nreview of the firmwide\nrisk portfolio, the\nchief risk officer\nregularly advises the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard of relevant risk\nmetrics and material\nexposures, including\nrisk limits and\nthresholds established\nin our risk appetite\nstatement.\n\nThe implementation of\nour risk governance\nstructure and core\nrisk management\nprocesses is overseen\nby Enterprise Risk,\nwhich reports to our\nchief risk officer,\nand is responsible for\nensuring that our\nenterprise risk\nmanagement framework\nprovides the Board,\nour risk committees\nand senior management\nwith a consistent and\nintegrated approach to\nmanaging our various\nrisks in a manner\nconsistent with our\nrisk appetite.\n\nOur revenue-producing\nunits, as well as\nTreasury, Engineering,\nHuman Capital\nManagement, Corporate\nand Workplace\nSolutions, and\nCorporate Planning &\nManagement, are\nconsidered our first\nline of defense. They\nare accountable for\nthe outcomes of our\nrisk-generating\nactivities, as well as\nfor assessing and\nmanaging those risks\nwithin our risk\nappetite.\n\nOur independent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions are\nconsidered our second\nline of defense and\nprovide independent\nassessment, oversight\nand challenge of the\nrisks taken by our\nfirst line of defense,\nas well as lead and\nparticipate in risk\ncommittees.\nIndependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions include\nCompliance, Conflicts\nResolution,\nControllers, Legal,\nRisk and Tax.\n\nInternal Audit is\nconsidered our third\nline of defense, and\nour director of\nInternal Audit reports\nto the Audit Committee\nof the Board and\nadministratively to\nour chief executive\nofficer. Internal\nAudit includes\nprofessionals with a\nbroad range of audit\nand industry\nexperience, including\nrisk management\nexpertise. Internal\nAudit is responsible\nfor independently\nassessing and\nvalidating the\neffectiveness of key\ncontrols, including\nthose within the risk\nmanagement framework,\nand providing timely\nreporting to the Audit\nCommittee of the\nBoard, senior\nmanagement and\nregulators.\n\nThe three lines of\ndefense structure\npromotes the\naccountability of\nfirst line risk\ntakers, provides a\nframework for\neffective challenge by\nthe second line and\nempowers independent\nreview from the third\nline.\n                                            \n  139    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nProcesses. We maintain\nvarious processes that\nare critical\ncomponents of our risk\nmanagement framework,\nincluding (i) risk\nidentification and\ncontrol assessment,\n(ii) risk appetite,\nlimits, thresholds and\nalerts setting, (iii)\nrisk metrics,\nreporting and\nmonitoring, and (iv)\nrisk decision-making.\n\n\u2022 Risk Identification\nand Control\nAssessment. We believe\nthe identification of\nour risks and related\ncontrol assessment is\na critical step in\nproviding our Board\nand senior management\ntransparency and\ninsight into the range\nand materiality of our\nrisks. We have a\ncomprehensive data\ncollection process,\nincluding firmwide\npolicies and\nprocedures that\nrequire all employees\nto report and escalate\nrisk events. Our\napproach for risk\nidentification and\ncontrol assessment is\ncomprehensive across\nall risk types, is\ndynamic and forward-\nlooking to reflect and\nadapt to our changing\nrisk profile and\nbusiness environment,\nleverages subject\nmatter expertise, and\nallows for\nprioritization of our\nmost critical risks.\nThis approach also\nencompasses our\ncontrol assessment,\nled by our second line\nof defense, to review\nand challenge the\ncontrol environment to\nhelp ensure it\nsupports our strategic\nbusiness plan.\n\nTo effectively assess\nour risks, we maintain\na daily discipline of\nmarking substantially\nall of our inventory\nto current market\nlevels. We carry our\ninventory at fair\nvalue, with changes in\nvaluation reflected\nimmediately in our\nrisk management\nsystems and in net\nrevenues. We do so\nbecause we believe\nthis discipline is one\nof the most effective\ntools for assessing\nand managing risk and\nthat it provides\ntransparent and\nrealistic insight into\nour inventory\nexposures.\n\nAn important part of\nour risk management\nprocess is firmwide\nstress testing. It\nallows us to quantify\nour exposure to tail\nrisks, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations,\nundertake risk/reward\nanalysis, and assess\nand mitigate our risk\npositions. Firmwide\nstress tests are\nperformed on a regular\nbasis and are designed\nto ensure a\ncomprehensive analysis\nof our vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic\nrisks combining\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, credit,\nmarket, liquidity and\nfunding, operational\nand compliance,\nclimate, strategic,\nsystemic and emerging\nrisks into a single\ncombined scenario. We\nalso perform ad hoc\nstress tests in\nanticipation of market\nevents or conditions.\nStress tests are also\nused to assess capital\nadequacy as part of\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess. See \u201cCapital\nManagement and\nRegulatory Capital \u2014\nCapital Management\u201d\nfor further\ninformation.\n\n\u2022 Risk Appetite,\nLimits, Thresholds and\nAlerts Setting. We\napply a framework of\nlimits and thresholds\nto control and monitor\nrisk across\ntransactions,\nproducts, businesses\nand markets. The\nBoard, directly or\nindirectly through its\nRisk Committee,\napproves limits,\nthresholds and alerts\nincluded in our risk\nappetite statement at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels. In\naddition, the Firmwide\nRisk Appetite\nCommittee, through\ndelegated authority\nfrom the Firmwide\nEnterprise Risk\nCommittee, is\nresponsible for\napproving our risk\nlimits, thresholds and\nalerts policy, subject\nto the overall limits\ndirectly or indirectly\napproved by the Board,\nand monitoring these\nlimits.\n\nThe Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee is\nresponsible for\napproving limits at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels.\nCertain limits may be\nset at levels that\nwill require periodic\nadjustment, rather\nthan at levels that\nreflect our maximum\nrisk appetite. This\nfosters an ongoing\ndialogue about risk\namong our first and\nsecond lines of\ndefense, committees\nand senior management,\nas well as rapid\nescalation of risk-\nrelated matters.\nAdditionally, through\ndelegated authority\nfrom the Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee,\nMarket Risk sets\nlimits at certain\nproduct and desk\nlevels, and Credit\nRisk sets limits for\nindividual\ncounterparties and\ntheir subsidiaries,\nindustries and\ncountries. Limits are\nreviewed regularly and\namended on a permanent\nor temporary basis to\nreflect changes to our\nstrategic business\nplan, as well as\nchanging market\nconditions, business\nconditions or risk\ntolerance.\n\n\u2022 Risk Metrics,\nReporting and\nMonitoring. Effective\nrisk reporting and\nrisk decision-making\ndepends on our ability\nto get the right\ninformation to the\nright people at the\nright time. As such,\nwe focus on the rigor\nand effectiveness of\nour risk systems, with\nthe objective of\nensuring that our risk\nmanagement technology\nsystems provide us\nwith complete,\naccurate and timely\ninformation. Our risk\nmetrics, reporting and\nmonitoring processes\nare designed to take\ninto account\ninformation about both\nexisting and emerging\nrisks, thereby\nenabling our risk\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement to perform\ntheir responsibilities\nwith the appropriate\nlevel of insight into\nrisk exposures.\nFurthermore, our limit\nand threshold breach\nprocesses provide\nmeans for timely\nescalation. We\nevaluate changes in\nour risk profile and\nour businesses,\nincluding changes in\nbusiness mix or\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate, by\nmonitoring risk\nfactors at a firmwide\nlevel.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    140  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \n\u2022 Risk Decision-\nMaking. Our governance\nstructure provides the\nprotocol and\nresponsibility for\ndecision-making on\nrisk management issues\nand is designed to\nensure implementation\nof those decisions. We\nmake extensive use of\nrisk committees that\nmeet regularly and\nserve as an important\nmeans to facilitate\nand foster ongoing\ndiscussions to manage\nand mitigate risks.\n\nWe maintain strong and\nproactive\ncommunication about\nrisk and we have a\nculture of\ncollaboration in\ndecision-making among\nour first and second\nlines of defense,\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement. While our\nfirst line of defense\nis responsible for\nmanagement of their\nrisk, we dedicate\nextensive resources to\nour second line of\ndefense in order to\nensure a strong\noversight structure\nand an appropriate\nsegregation of duties.\nWe regularly reinforce\nour strong culture of\nescalation and\naccountability across\nall functions.\n\nPeople. Even the best\ntechnology serves only\nas a tool for helping\nto make informed\ndecisions in real time\nabout the risks we are\ntaking. Ultimately,\neffective risk\nmanagement requires\nour people to\ninterpret our risk\ndata on an ongoing and\ntimely basis and\nadjust risk positions\naccordingly. The\nexperience of our\nprofessionals, and\ntheir understanding of\nthe nuances and\nlimitations of each\nrisk measure, guides\nus in assessing\nexposures and\nmaintaining them\nwithin prudent levels.\n\nWe reinforce a culture\nof effective risk\nmanagement, consistent\nwith our risk\nappetite, in our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nas well as in the way\nwe evaluate\nperformance, and\nrecognize and reward\nour people. Our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nincluding certain\nsessions led by our\nmost senior leaders,\nare focused on the\nimportance of risk\nmanagement, client\nrelationships and\nreputational\nexcellence. As part of\nour performance review\nprocess, we assess\nreputational\nexcellence, including\nhow an employee\nexercises good risk\nmanagement and\nreputational judgment,\nand adheres to our\ncode of conduct and\ncompliance policies.\nOur review and reward\nprocesses are designed\nto communicate and\nreinforce to our\nprofessionals the link\nbetween behavior and\nhow people are\nrecognized, the need\nto focus on our\nclients and our\nreputation, and the\nneed to always act in\naccordance with our\nhighest standards.\n                                              \n  Structure                                   \n                                              \nUltimate oversight of\nrisk is the\nresponsibility of our\nBoard. The Board\noversees risk both\ndirectly and through\nits committees,\nincluding its Risk\nCommittee. We also\nhave a series of\ncommittees that\ngenerally consist of\nsenior managers from\nboth our first and\nsecond lines of\ndefense, with specific\nrisk management\nmandates that have\noversight or decision-\nmaking\nresponsibilities for\nrisk management\nactivities. We have\nestablished procedures\nfor these committees\nso that appropriate\ninformation barriers\nare in place. Our\nprimary risk\ncommittees, most of\nwhich also have\nadditional sub-\ncommittees, councils\nor working groups, are\ndescribed below. In\naddition to these\ncommittees, we have\nother risk committees\nthat provide oversight\nfor different\nbusinesses,\nactivities, products,\nregions and entities.\nAll of our committees\nhave responsibility\nfor considering the\nimpact on our\nreputation of the\ntransactions and\nactivities that they\noversee.\n\nMembership of our risk\ncommittees is reviewed\nregularly and updated\nto reflect changes in\nthe responsibilities\nof the committee\nmembers. Accordingly,\nthe length of time\nthat members serve on\nthe respective\ncommittees varies as\ndetermined by the\ncommittee chairs and\nbased on the\nresponsibilities of\nthe members.\n\nThe chart below\npresents an overview\nof our risk management\ngovernance structure.\n\nManagement Committee.\nThe Management\nCommittee oversees our\nglobal activities. It\nprovides this\noversight directly and\nthrough authority\ndelegated to\ncommittees it has\nestablished. This\ncommittee consists of\nour most senior\nleaders, and is\nchaired by our chief\nexecutive officer.\nMost members of the\nManagement Committee\nare also members of\nother committees.

The\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee is\nresponsible for\noverseeing all of our\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks. As\npart of such\noversight, the\ncommittee is\nresponsible for the\nongoing review,\napproval and\nmonitoring of our\nenterprise risk\nmanagement framework,\nas well as our risk\nlimits, and thresholds\nand alerts policy,\nthrough delegated\nauthority to the\nFirmwide Risk Appetite\nCommittee. The\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee also\nreviews new\nsignificant strategic\nbusiness initiatives\nto determine whether\nthey are consistent\nwith our risk appetite\nand risk management\ncapabilities.\nAdditionally, the\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee\nperforms enhanced\nreviews of significant\nrisk events, the top\nresidual and emerging\nrisks, and the overall\nrisk and control\nenvironment in each of\nour business units in\norder to propose\nuplifts, identify\nelements that are\ncommon to all business\nunits and analyze the\nconsolidated residual\nrisks that we face.\nThis committee, which\nreports to the\nManagement Committee,\nis co-chaired by our\npresident and chief\noperating officer and\nour chief risk\nofficer, who are\nappointed as chairs by\nour chief executive\nofficer, and the vice-\nchair is our chief\nfinancial officer, who\nis appointed as vice-\nchair by the chairs of\nthe Firmwide\nEnterprise Risk\nCommittee.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nGCLA. GCLA is\nliquidity that we\nmaintain to meet a\nbroad range of\npotential cash\noutflows and\ncollateral needs in a\nstressed environment.\nA primary liquidity\nprinciple is to pre-\nfund our estimated\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs\nduring a liquidity\ncrisis and hold this\nliquidity in the form\nof unencumbered,\nhighly liquid\nsecurities and cash.\nWe believe that the\nsecurities held in our\nGCLA would be readily\nconvertible to cash in\na matter of days,\nthrough liquidation,\nby entering into\nrepurchase agreements\nor from maturities of\nresale agreements, and\nthat this cash would\nallow us to meet\nimmediate obligations\nwithout needing to\nsell other assets or\ndepend on additional\nfunding from credit-\nsensitive markets.\n\nOur GCLA reflects the\nfollowing principles:\n\n\u2022 The first days or\nweeks of a liquidity\ncrisis are the most\ncritical to a\ncompany\u2019s survival;\n\n\u2022 Focus must be\nmaintained on all\npotential cash and\ncollateral outflows,\nnot just disruptions\nto financing flows.\nOur businesses are\ndiverse, and our\nliquidity needs are\ndetermined by many\nfactors, including\nmarket movements,\ncollateral\nrequirements and\nclient commitments,\nall of which can\nchange dramatically in\na difficult funding\nenvironment;\n\n\u2022 During a liquidity\ncrisis, credit-\nsensitive funding,\nincluding unsecured\ndebt, certain deposits\nand some types of\nsecured financing\nagreements, may be\nunavailable, and the\nterms (e.g., interest\nrates, collateral\nprovisions and tenor)\nor availability of\nother types of secured\nfinancing may change\nand certain deposits\nmay be withdrawn; and\n\n\u2022 As a result of our\npolicy to pre-fund\nliquidity that we\nestimate may be needed\nin a crisis, we hold\nmore unencumbered\nsecurities and have\nlarger funding\nbalances than our\nbusinesses would\notherwise require. We\nbelieve that our\nliquidity is stronger\nwith greater balances\nof highly liquid\nunencumbered\nsecurities, even\nthough it increases\nour total assets and\nour funding costs.\n\nWe maintain our GCLA\nacross Group Inc.,\nGoldman Sachs Funding\nLLC (Funding IHC) and\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries, asset\ntypes and clearing\nagents with the goal\nof providing us with\nsufficient operating\nliquidity to ensure\ntimely settlement in\nall major markets,\neven in a difficult\nfunding environment.\nIn addition to the\nGCLA, we maintain cash\nbalances and\nsecurities in several\nof our other entities,\nprimarily for use in\nspecific currencies,\nentities or\njurisdictions where we\ndo not have immediate\naccess to parent\ncompany liquidity.\n\nAsset-Liability\nManagement. Our\nliquidity risk\nmanagement policies\nare designed to ensure\nwe have a sufficient\namount of financing,\neven when funding\nmarkets experience\npersistent stress. We\nmanage the maturities\nand diversity of our\nfunding across\nmarkets, products and\ncounterparties, and\nseek to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nOur approach to asset-\nliability management\nincludes:\n\n\u2022 Conservatively\nmanaging the overall\ncharacteristics of our\nfunding book, with a\nfocus on maintaining\nlong-term, diversified\nsources of funding in\nexcess of our current\nrequirements. See\n\u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nFunding Sources\u201d for\nfurther information;\n\n\u2022 Actively managing\nand monitoring our\nasset base, with\nparticular focus on\nthe liquidity, holding\nperiod and ability to\nfund assets on a\nsecured basis. We\nassess our funding\nrequirements and our\nability to liquidate\nassets in a stressed\nenvironment while\nappropriately managing\nrisk. This enables us\nto determine the most\nappropriate funding\nproducts and tenors.\nSee \u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nBalance Sheet\nManagement\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our balance\nsheet management\nprocess and \u201c\u2014 Funding\nSources \u2014 Secured\nFunding\u201d for further\ninformation about\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis; and\n\n\u2022 Raising secured and\nunsecured financing\nthat has a long tenor\nrelative to the\nliquidity profile of\nour assets. This\nreduces the risk that\nour liabilities will\ncome due in advance of\nour ability to\ngenerate liquidity\nfrom the sale of our\nassets. Because we\nmaintain a highly\nliquid balance sheet,\nthe holding period of\ncertain of our assets\nmay be materially\nshorter than their\ncontractual maturity\ndates.\n\nOur goal is to ensure\nthat we maintain\nsufficient liquidity\nto fund our assets and\nmeet our contractual\nand contingent\nobligations in normal\ntimes, as well as\nduring periods of\nmarket stress. Through\nour dynamic balance\nsheet management\nprocess, we use actual\nand projected asset\nbalances to determine\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding requirements.\nFunding plans are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee.\nIn addition, our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions analyze, and\nthe Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee\nreviews, our total\nunsecured long-term\nborrowings and total\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nto help ensure that we\nmaintain a level of\nlong-term funding that\nis sufficient to meet\nour long-term\nfinancing\nrequirements. In a\nliquidity crisis, we\nwould begin by\nliquidating and\nmonetizing our GCLA\nbefore selling other\nassets. However, we\nrecognize that orderly\nasset sales may be\nprudent or necessary\nin a severe or\npersistent liquidity\ncrisis.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q    144  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nSubsidiary Funding\nPolicies\nThe majority of our\nunsecured borrowings\nis raised by Group\nInc., which provides\nthe necessary funds to\nFunding IHC and other\nsubsidiaries, some of\nwhich are regulated,\nto meet their asset\nfinancing, liquidity\nand capital\nrequirements. In\naddition, Group Inc.\nprovides its regulated\nsubsidiaries with the\nnecessary capital to\nmeet their regulatory\nrequirements. The\nbenefits of this\napproach to subsidiary\nfunding are enhanced\ncontrol and greater\nflexibility to meet\nthe funding\nrequirements of our\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nis also raised at the\nsubsidiary level\nthrough a variety of\nproducts, including\ndeposits, secured\nfunding and unsecured\nborrowings.\n\nOur intercompany\nfunding policies\nassume that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s funds or\nsecurities are not\nfreely available to\nits parent, Funding\nIHC or other\nsubsidiaries unless\n(i) legally provided\nfor and (ii) there are\nno additional\nregulatory, tax or\nother restrictions. In\nparticular, many of\nour subsidiaries are\nsubject to laws that\nauthorize regulatory\nbodies to block or\nreduce the flow of\nfunds from those\nsubsidiaries to Group\nInc. or Funding IHC.\nRegulatory action of\nthat kind could impede\naccess to funds that\nGroup Inc. needs to\nmake payments on its\nobligations.\nAccordingly, we assume\nthat the capital\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or other\nsubsidiaries and any\nother financing\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or Funding\nIHC until the maturity\nof such financing.\n\nGroup Inc. has\nprovided substantial\namounts of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness, directly\nor indirectly, to its\nregulated\nsubsidiaries. For\nexample, as of June\n2024, Group Inc. had\n$36.97 billion of\nequity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness invested\nin GS&Co., its\nprincipal U.S.\nregistered broker-\ndealer; $48.00 billion\ninvested in GSI, a\nregulated U.K. broker-\ndealer; $2.14 billion\ninvested in GSJCL, a\nregulated Japanese\nbroker-dealer; $59.26\nbillion invested in GS\nBank USA, a regulated\nNew York State-\nchartered bank; and\n$5.09 billion invested\nin GSIB, a regulated\nU.K. bank. Group Inc.\nalso provides\nfinancing, directly or\nindirectly, in the\nform of: $136.58\nbillion of\nunsubordinated loans\n(including secured\nloans of $48.45\nbillion) and $34.09\nbillion of collateral\nand cash deposits to\nthese entities as of\nJune 2024. In\naddition, as of June\n2024, Group Inc. had\nsignificant amounts of\ncapital invested in\nand loans to its other\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nContingency Funding\nPlan. We maintain a\ncontingency funding\nplan to provide a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nliquidity crisis\nsituation or periods\nof market stress. Our\ncontingency funding\nplan outlines a list\nof potential risk\nfactors, key reports\nand metrics that are\nreviewed on an ongoing\nbasis to assist in\nassessing the severity\nof, and managing\nthrough, a liquidity\ncrisis and/or market\ndislocation. The\ncontingency funding\nplan also describes in\ndetail our potential\nresponses if our\nassessments indicate\nthat we have entered a\nliquidity crisis,\nwhich include pre-\nfunding for what we\nestimate will be our\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs, as\nwell as utilizing\nsecondary sources of\nliquidity. Mitigants\nand action items to\naddress specific risks\nwhich may arise are\nalso described and\nassigned to\nindividuals\nresponsible for\nexecution.\n\nThe contingency\nfunding plan\nidentifies key groups\nof individuals and\ntheir\nresponsibilities,\nwhich include\nfostering effective\ncoordination, control\nand distribution of\ninformation,\nimplementing liquidity\nmaintenance activities\nand managing internal\nand external\ncommunication, all of\nwhich are critical in\nthe management of a\ncrisis or period of\nmarket stress.\nStress Tests\nIn order to determine\nthe appropriate size\nof our GCLA, we model\nliquidity outflows\nover a range of\nscenarios and time\nhorizons. One of our\nprimary internal\nliquidity risk models,\nreferred to as the\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow, quantifies\nour liquidity risks\nover a 30-day stress\nscenario. We also\nconsider other\nfactors, including,\nbut not limited to, an\nassessment of our\npotential intraday\nliquidity needs\nthrough an additional\ninternal liquidity\nrisk model, referred\nto as the Intraday\nLiquidity Model, the\nresults of our long-\nterm stress testing\nmodels, our resolution\nliquidity models and\nother applicable\nregulatory\nrequirements and a\nqualitative assessment\nof our condition, as\nwell as the financial\nmarkets. The results\nof the Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow, the\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel, the long-term\nstress testing models\nand the resolution\nliquidity models are\nreported to senior\nmanagement on a\nregular basis. We also\nperform firmwide\nstress tests.

Our Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow is\nbased on conducting\nmultiple scenarios\nthat include\ncombinations of\nmarket-wide and firm-\nspecific stress. These\nscenarios are\ncharacterized by the\nfollowing qualitative\nelements:\n\n\u2022 Severely challenged\nmarket environments,\nwhich include low\nconsumer and corporate\nconfidence, financial\nand political\ninstability, and\nadverse changes in\nmarket values,\nincluding potential\ndeclines in equity\nmarkets and widening\nof credit spreads; and\n\n\u2022 A firm-specific\ncrisis potentially\ntriggered by material\nlosses, reputational\ndamage (including, as\na result of, the\ndissemination of\nnegative information\nthrough social media),\nlitigation and/or a\nratings downgrade.\n\nThe following are key\nmodeling elements of\nour Modeled Liquidity\nOutflow:\n\n\u2022 Liquidity needs over\na 30-day scenario;\n\n\u2022 A two-notch\ndowngrade of our long-\nterm senior unsecured\ncredit ratings;\n\n\u2022 Changing conditions\nin funding markets,\nwhich limit our access\nto unsecured and\nsecured funding;\n\n\u2022 No support from\nadditional government\nfunding facilities.\nAlthough we have\naccess to various\ncentral bank funding\nprograms, we do not\nassume reliance on\nadditional sources of\nfunding in a liquidity\ncrisis; and\n\n\u2022 A combination of\ncontractual outflows\nand contingent\noutflows arising from\nboth our on- and off-\nbalance sheet\narrangements.\nContractual outflows\ninclude, among other\nthings, upcoming\nmaturities of\nunsecured debt, term\ndeposits and secured\nfunding. Contingent\noutflows include,\namong other things,\nthe withdrawal of\ncustomer credit\nbalances in our prime\nbrokerage business,\nincrease in variation\nmargin requirements\ndue to adverse changes\nin the value of our\nexchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared\nderivatives, draws on\nunfunded commitments\nand withdrawals of\ndeposits that have no\ncontractual maturity.\nSee notes to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\ncontractual outflows,\nincluding Note 11 for\ncollateralized\nfinancings, Note 13\nfor deposits, Note 14\nfor unsecured long-\nterm borrowings and\nNote 15 for operating\nlease payments, and\n\u201cOff-Balance Sheet\nArrangements\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our various\ntypes of off-balance\nsheet arrangements.\n\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel. Our Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nmeasures our intraday\nliquidity needs in a\nscenario where access\nto sources of intraday\nliquidity may become\nconstrained. The\nintraday liquidity\nmodel considers a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding historical\nsettlement activity.\n\nLong-Term Stress\nTesting. We utilize\nlonger-term stress\ntests to take a\nforward view on our\nliquidity position\nthrough prolonged\nstress periods in\nwhich we experience a\nsevere liquidity\nstress and recover in\nan environment that\ncontinues to be\nchallenging. We are\nfocused on ensuring\nconservative asset-\nliability management\nto prepare for a\nprolonged period of\npotential stress,\nseeking to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nResolution Liquidity\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established our\nResolution Liquidity\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich estimates\nliquidity needs of our\nmajor subsidiaries in\na stressed\nenvironment. The\nliquidity needs are\nmeasured using our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow assumptions\nand include certain\nadditional inter-\naffiliate exposures.\nWe have also\nestablished our\nResolution Liquidity\nExecution Need\nframework, which\nmeasures the liquidity\nneeds of our major\nsubsidiaries to\nstabilize and wind\ndown following a Group\nInc. bankruptcy filing\nin accordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIn addition, we have\nestablished a triggers\nand alerts framework,\nwhich is designed to\nprovide the Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc.\n                                              \n  Limits                                      \n                                              \nWe use liquidity risk\nlimits at various\nlevels and across\nliquidity risk types\nto manage the size of\nour liquidity\nexposures. Limits are\nmeasured relative to\nacceptable levels of\nrisk given our\nliquidity risk\ntolerance. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess.\n\nLimits are monitored\nby Treasury and\nLiquidity Risk.\nLiquidity Risk is\nresponsible for\nidentifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded.\n                                              \n  GCLA and Unencumbered Metrics               \n                                              \nGCLA.

We\nmaintain our GCLA to\nenable us to meet\ncurrent and potential\nliquidity requirements\nof our parent company,\nGroup Inc., and its\nsubsidiaries. Our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow and Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nincorporate a\nrequirement for Group\nInc., as well as a\nstandalone requirement\nfor each of our major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nIHC is required to\nprovide the necessary\nliquidity to Group\nInc. during the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, and is also\nobligated to provide\ncapital and liquidity\nsupport to major\nsubsidiaries in the\nevent of our material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure.

The fair\nvalue of our\nunencumbered assets\naveraged $290.80\nbillion for the three\nmonths ended June 2024\nand $292.45 billion\nfor the three months\nended March 2024.

Liquidity\nRegulatory Framework\nWe are subject to a\nminimum Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR)\nunder the LCR rule\napproved by the U.S.\nfederal bank\nregulatory agencies.\nThe LCR rule requires\norganizations to\nmaintain an adequate\nratio of eligible\nhigh-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) to\nexpected net cash\noutflows under an\nacute, short-term\nliquidity stress\nscenario. Eligible\nHQLA excludes HQLA\nheld by subsidiaries\nthat is in excess of\ntheir minimum\nrequirement and is\nsubject to transfer\nrestrictions. We are\nrequired to maintain a\nminimum LCR of 100%.\nWe expect that\nfluctuations in client\nactivity, business mix\nand the market\nenvironment will\nimpact our LCR.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nWe are aware of the\ninherent limitations\nto VaR and therefore\nuse a variety of risk\nmeasures in our market\nrisk management\nprocess. Inherent\nlimitations to VaR\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 VaR does not\nestimate potential\nlosses over longer\ntime horizons where\nmoves may be extreme;\n\n\u2022 VaR does not take\naccount of the\nrelative liquidity of\ndifferent risk\npositions; and\n\n\u2022 Previous moves in\nmarket risk factors\nmay not produce\naccurate predictions\nof all future market\nmoves.\n\nTo comprehensively\ncapture our exposures\nand relevant risks in\nour VaR calculation,\nwe use historical\nsimulations with full\nvaluation of market\nfactors at the\nposition level by\nsimultaneously\nshocking the relevant\nmarket factors for\nthat position. These\nmarket factors include\nspot prices, credit\nspreads, funding\nspreads, yield curves,\nvolatility and\ncorrelation, and are\nupdated periodically\nbased on changes in\nthe composition of\npositions, as well as\nvariations in market\nconditions. We sample\nfrom five years of\nhistorical data to\ngenerate the scenarios\nfor our VaR\ncalculation. The\nhistorical data is\nweighted so that the\nrelative importance of\nthe data reduces over\ntime. This gives\ngreater importance to\nmore recent\nobservations and\nreflects current asset\nvolatilities, which\nimproves the accuracy\nof our estimates of\npotential loss. As a\nresult, even if our\npositions included in\nVaR were unchanged,\nour VaR would increase\nwith increasing market\nvolatility and vice\nversa.\n\nGiven its reliance on\nhistorical data, VaR\nis most effective in\nestimating risk\nexposures in markets\nin which there are no\nsudden fundamental\nchanges or shifts in\nmarket conditions.\n\nOur VaR measure does\nnot include:\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nnot accounted for at\nfair value, such as\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities and loans,\ndeposits and unsecured\nborrowings that are\naccounted for at\namortized cost;\n\n\u2022 Available-for-sale\nsecurities for which\nthe related unrealized\nfair value gains and\nlosses are included in\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss);\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nbest measured and\nmonitored using\nsensitivity measures;\nand\n\n\u2022 The impact of\nchanges in\ncounterparty and our\nown credit spreads on\nderivatives, as well\nas changes in our own\ncredit spreads on\nfinancial liabilities\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected.\n\nWe perform daily\nbacktesting of our VaR\nmodel (i.e., comparing\ndaily net revenues for\npositions included in\nVaR to the VaR measure\ncalculated as of the\nprior business day) at\nthe firmwide level and\nfor each of our\nbusinesses and major\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nEarnings-at-Risk. We\nmanage our interest\nrate risk using the\nEaR metric. EaR\nmeasures the estimated\nimpact of changes in\ninterest rates to our\nnet revenues and\npreferred stock\ndividends over a\ndefined time horizon.\nEaR complements the\nVaR metric, which\nmeasures the impact of\ninterest rate changes\nthat have an immediate\nimpact on the fair\nvalues of our assets\nand liabilities (i.e.,\nmark-to-market\nchanges).

We\nmeasure EaR over a\none-year time horizon\nfollowing a 100- and\n200-basis point\ninstantaneous parallel\nshock in both short-\nand long-term interest\nrates. This\nsensitivity is\ncalculated relative to\na baseline market\nscenario, which takes\ninto consideration,\namong other things,\nthe market\u2019s\nexpectation of forward\nrates, as well as our\nexpectation of future\nbusiness activity.\nThese scenarios\ninclude contractual\nelements of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock, and certain\noff-balance sheet\ninstruments, such as\nrates of interest,\nprincipal repayment\nschedules, maturity\nand reset dates, and\nany interest rate\nceilings or floors, as\nwell as assumptions\nwith respect to our\nbalance sheet size and\ncomposition,\nprepayment behavior\nand deposit repricing.\nDeposit repricing is\ncaptured by evaluating\nthe change in deposit\nrate paid relative to\nthe change in market\nrates (deposit beta)\nand we calibrate the\ndeposit betas used in\nour models by using a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding observed\nhistorical behavior,\nfuture expectations,\nfunding needs and the\ncompetitive landscape.\nWe continuously\nmonitor the\nperformance of our key\nassumptions against\nobserved behavior and\nregularly review their\nsensitivity on our\nrisk metrics.\n\nWe manage EaR with a\ngoal to reduce\npotential volatility\nresulting from changes\nin interest rates so\nit remains within our\nEaR risk appetite. Our\nEaR scenario is\nregularly evaluated\nand updated, if\nnecessary, to reflect\nchanges in our\nbusiness plans, market\nconditions and other\nmacroeconomic factors.\nWhile management uses\nthe best information\navailable to estimate\nEaR, actual results\nmay differ materially\nas a result of, among\nother things, changes\nin the economic\nenvironment or\nassumptions used in\nthe process. We also\nmeasure the\nsensitivity of the\neconomic value of our\nequity (EVE) to\nchanges in interest\nrates. Compared to\nEaR, EVE provides a\nlonger-term\nmeasurement of the\ninterest rate risk\nexposure, primarily on\nnon-trading assets and\nliabilities, by\ncapturing the net\nimpact of changes in\ninterest rates to the\npresent value of their\ncash flows.\n                                            \n  151    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Stress\nTesting. Stress\ntesting is a method of\ndetermining the effect\nof various\nhypothetical stress\nscenarios. We use\nstress tests to\nexamine risks of\nspecific portfolios,\nas well as the\npotential impact of\nour significant risk\nexposures. We use a\nvariety of stress\ntesting techniques to\ncalculate the\npotential loss from a\nwide range of market\nmoves on our\nportfolios, including\nfirmwide stress tests,\nsensitivity analysis\nand scenario analysis.\nThe results of our\nvarious stress tests\nare analyzed together\nfor risk management\npurposes. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\nSensitivity analysis\nis used to quantify\nthe impact of a market\nmove in a single risk\nfactor across all\npositions (e.g.,\nequity prices or\ncredit spreads) using\na variety of defined\nmarket shocks, ranging\nfrom those that could\nbe expected over a\none-day time horizon\nup to those that could\ntake many months to\noccur. We also use\nsensitivity analysis\nto quantify the impact\nof the default of any\nsingle entity, which\ncaptures the risk of\nlarge or concentrated\nexposures. Scenario\nanalysis is used to\nquantify the impact of\na specified event,\nincluding how the\nevent impacts multiple\nrisk factors\nsimultaneously. For\nexample, for sovereign\nstress testing we\ncalculate potential\ndirect exposure\nassociated with our\nsovereign positions,\nas well as the\ncorresponding debt,\nequity and currency\nexposures associated\nwith our non-sovereign\npositions that may be\nimpacted by the\nsovereign distress.\nWhen conducting\nscenario analysis, we\noften consider a\nnumber of possible\noutcomes for each\nscenario, ranging from\nmoderate to severely\nadverse market\nimpacts. In addition,\nthese stress tests are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical events and\nforward-looking\nhypothetical\nscenarios. Unlike VaR\nmeasures, which have\nan implied probability\nbecause they are\ncalculated at a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, there may not\nbe an implied\nprobability that our\nstress testing\nscenarios will occur.\nInstead, stress\ntesting is used to\nmodel both moderate\nand more extreme moves\nin underlying market\nfactors. When\nestimating potential\nloss, we generally\nassume that our\npositions cannot be\nreduced or hedged\n(although experience\ndemonstrates that we\nare generally able to\ndo so).\n\nLimits We use market\nrisk limits at various\nlevels to manage the\nsize of our market\nexposures. These\nlimits are set based\non VaR, EaR and on a\nrange of stress tests\nrelevant to our\nexposures. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess. Limits are\nmonitored by Treasury\nand Risk. Risk is\nresponsible for\nidentifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded (e.g., due to\npositional changes or\nchanges in market\nconditions, such as\nincreased volatilities\nor changes in\ncorrelations). Such\ninstances are\nremediated by a\nreduction in the\npositions we hold\nand/or a temporary or\npermanent increase to\nthe limit, if\nwarranted. Metrics We\nanalyze VaR at the\nfirmwide level and a\nvariety of more\ndetailed levels,\nincluding by risk\ncategory, business and\nregion.\nDiversification effect\nin the tables below\nrepresents the\ndifference between\ntotal VaR and the sum\nof the VaRs for the\nfour risk categories.\nThis effect arises\nbecause the four\nmarket risk categories\nare not perfectly\ncorrelated.\nSubstantially all\npositions in VaR are\nincluded within Global\nBanking & Markets.

Credit Risk Management Overview Credit\nrisk represents the potential for loss due to\nthe default or deterioration in credit quality\nof a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives\ncounterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of\nsecurities or other instruments we hold. Our\nexposure to credit risk comes mostly from\nclient transactions in OTC derivatives and\nloans and lending commitments. Credit risk\nalso comes from cash placed with banks,\nsecurities financing transactions (i.e.,\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending activities)\nand customer and other receivables.\n\nCredit Risk, which is independent of our\nrevenue-producing units and reports to our\nchief risk officer, has primary responsibility\nfor assessing, monitoring and managing our\ncredit risk through firmwide oversight across\nour global businesses. In addition, we hold\nother positions that give rise to credit risk\n(e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These\ncredit risks are captured as a component of\nmarket risk measures, which are monitored and\nmanaged by Market Risk. We also enter into\nderivatives to manage market risk exposures.\nSuch derivatives also give rise to credit\nrisk, which is monitored and managed by Credit\nRisk. Credit Risk Management Process Our\nprocess for managing credit risk includes the\ncritical components of our risk management\nframework described in the \u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk Management,\u201d as well as the\nfollowing: \u2022 Monitoring compliance with\nestablished credit risk limits and reporting\nour credit exposures and credit\nconcentrations; \u2022 Establishing or approving\nunderwriting standards; \u2022 Assessing the\nlikelihood that a counterparty will default on\nits payment obligations; \u2022 Measuring our\ncurrent and potential credit exposure and\nlosses resulting from a counterparty default;\n\u2022 Using credit risk mitigants, including\ncollateral and hedging; and \u2022 Maximizing\nrecovery through active workout and\nrestructuring of claims. We also perform\ncredit analyses, which incorporate initial and\nongoing evaluations of the capacity and\nwillingness of a counterparty to meet its\nfinancial obligations. For substantially all\nof our credit exposures, the core of our\nprocess is an annual counterparty credit\nevaluation or more frequently if deemed\nnecessary as a result of events or changes in\ncircumstances. We determine an internal credit\nrating for the counterparty by considering the\nresults of the credit evaluations and\nassumptions with respect to the nature of and\noutlook for the counterparty\u2019s industry and\nthe economic environment. For collateralized\nloans, we also take into consideration\ncollateral received or other credit support\narrangements when determining an internal\ncredit rating. Senior personnel, with\nexpertise in specific industries, inspect and\napprove credit reviews and internal credit\nratings. Our risk assessment process may also\ninclude, where applicable, reviewing certain\nkey metrics, including, but not limited to,\ndelinquency status, collateral value, FICO\ncredit scores and other risk factors.\n                                            \n  155    Goldman Sachs June 2024 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These shocks\ncover a wide range of\nmoderate and more\nextreme market\nmovements, including\nshocks to multiple\nrisk factors,\nconsistent with the\noccurrence of a severe\nmarket or economic\nevent. In the case of\nsovereign default, we\nestimate the direct\nimpact of the default\non our sovereign\ncredit exposures,\nchanges to our credit\nexposures arising from\npotential market moves\nin response to the\ndefault, and the\nimpact of credit\nmarket deterioration\non corporate borrowers\nand counterparties\nthat may result from\nthe sovereign default.\nUnlike potential\nexposure, which is\ncalculated within a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, stress testing\ndoes not generally\nassume a probability\nof these events\noccurring.

The\nparameters of these\nshocks vary based on\nthe scenario reflected\nin each stress test.\nWe review estimated\nlosses produced by the\nstress tests in order\nto understand their\nmagnitude, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations, and\nassess and seek to\nmitigate our\nexposures, where\nnecessary.\n                                              \n  Limits                                      \n                                              \nWe use credit risk\nlimits at various\nlevels, as well as\nunderwriting standards\nto manage the size and\nnature of our credit\nexposures.

OTC Derivatives.\nOur credit exposure on\nOTC derivatives arises\nprimarily from our\nmarket-making\nactivities. As a\nmarket maker, we enter\ninto derivative\ntransactions to\nprovide liquidity to\nclients and to\nfacilitate the\ntransfer and hedging\nof their risks. We\nalso enter into\nderivatives to manage\nmarket risk exposures.\nWe manage our credit\nexposure on OTC\nderivatives using the\ncredit risk process,\nmeasures, limits and\nrisk mitigants\ndescribed above.\n\nWe generally enter\ninto OTC derivatives\ntransactions under\nbilateral collateral\narrangements that\nrequire the daily\nexchange of\ncollateral. As credit\nrisk is an essential\ncomponent of fair\nvalue, we include a\ncredit valuation\nadjustment (CVA) in\nthe fair value of\nderivatives to reflect\ncounterparty credit\nrisk, as described in\nNote 7 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. CVA is a\nfunction of the\npresent value of\nexpected exposure, the\nprobability of\ncounterparty default\nand the assumed\nrecovery upon default.\nThe table below\npresents our net\ncredit exposure from\nOTC derivatives and\nthe concentration by\nindustry and region.\n                                              \n               As of                          \n                      June    December        \n  $ in                2024              2023  \n  millio\u2026                                     \n  OTC                                         \n  deriva\u2026    $38,089           $42,950        \n  assets                                      \n  Collat\u2026                                     \n  (not                                        \n  netted     -13,602           -14,420        \n  under                                       \n  U.S.                                        \n  GAAP)                                       \n  Net                                         \n  credit     $24,487           $28,530        \n  exposu\u2026                                     \n  Indust\u2026                                     \n  Consum\u2026                                     \n  &                3     %           3     %  \n  Retail                                      \n  Divers\u2026         10     %          11     %  \n  Indust\u2026                                     \n  Financ\u2026         19     %          21     %  \n  Instit\u2026                                     \n  Funds           23     %          20     %  \n  Health\u2026          1     %           2     %  \n  Munici\u2026                                     \n  &                3     %           4     %  \n  Nonpro\u2026                                     \n  Natural                                     \n  Resour\u2026         22     %          17     %  \n  &                                           \n  Utilit\u2026                                     \n  Sovere\u2026         10     %          14     %  \n  Techno\u2026                                     \n  Media &          6     %           6     %  \n  Teleco\u2026                                     \n  Other                                       \n  (inclu\u2026                                     \n  Special          3     %           2     %  \n  Purpose                                     \n  Vehicl\u2026                                     \n  Total          100     %         100     %  \n  Region                                      \n  Americ\u2026         41     %          48     %  \n  EMEA            52     %          45     %  \n  Asia             7     %           7     %  \n  Total          100     %         100     %  \n                                              \nOur credit exposure\n(before any potential\nrecoveries) to OTC\nderivative\ncounterparties that\ndefaulted during the\nsix months ended June\n2024 remained low,\nrepresenting less than\n2% of our total credit\nexposure from OTC\nderivatives.

Accordingly, we\nhave in place a\ncomprehensive capital\nmanagement policy that\nprovides a framework,\ndefines objectives and\nestablishes guidelines\nto maintain an\nappropriate level and\ncomposition of capital\nin both business-as-\nusual and stressed\nconditions. Our\ncapital management\nframework is designed\nto provide us with the\ninformation needed to\nidentify and\ncomprehensively manage\nrisk, and develop and\napply projected stress\nscenarios that capture\nidiosyncratic\nvulnerabilities with a\ngoal of holding\nsufficient capital to\nremain adequately\ncapitalized even after\nexperiencing a severe\nstress event. See\n\u201cCapital Management\nand Regulatory\nCapital\u201d for further\ninformation about our\ncapital management\nprocess.\n\nWe have established a\ncomprehensive\ngovernance structure\nto manage and oversee\nour day-to-day capital\nmanagement activities\nand to ensure\ncompliance with\ncapital rules and\nrelated policies. Our\ncapital management\nactivities are\noverseen by the Board\nand its committees.\nThe Board is\nresponsible for\napproving our annual\ncapital plan and the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard approves our\ncapital management\npolicy, which details\nthe risk committees\nand members of senior\nmanagement who are\nresponsible for the\nongoing monitoring of\nour capital adequacy\nand evaluation of\ncurrent and future\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, the\nreview of the results\nof our capital\nplanning and stress\ntests processes, and\nthe results of our\ncapital models. In\naddition, our risk\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement are\nresponsible for the\nreview of our\ncontingency capital\nplan, key capital\nadequacy metrics,\nincluding regulatory\ncapital ratios, and\ncapital plan metrics,\nsuch as the payout\nratio, as well as\nmonitoring capital\ntargets and potential\nbreaches of capital\nrequirements.\n\nOur process for\nmanaging capital risk\nincludes independent\nreview by Risk that\nassesses regulatory\ncapital policies and\nrelated\ninterpretations and\nescalates certain\ninterpretations to\nsenior management\nand/or the appropriate\nrisk committee.

As\npart of its oversight,\nthe Public\nResponsibilities\nCommittee receives\nperiodic updates on\nour sustainability\nstrategy, and also\nperiodically reviews\nour governance and\nrelated policies and\nprocesses for\nsustainability and\nclimate change-related\nmatters. Senior\nmanagement within\nRisk, in coordination\nwith senior management\nin both our revenue-\nproducing units and\nour other independent\nrisk oversight and\ncontrol functions, is\nresponsible for the\ndevelopment of the\nclimate-related and\nenvironmental risk\nprogram. The objective\nof this program is to\nintegrate climate-\nrelated and\nenvironmental risks\ninto existing risk\ndisciplines and\nbusiness\nconsiderations, such\nas the integration of\nclimate risk into our\ncredit evaluation and\nunderwriting processes\nfor select industries.\n\nSee \u201cBusiness \u2014\nSustainability\u201d in\nPart I, Item 1 and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part\nI, Item 1A of the 2023\nForm 10-K for\ninformation about our\nsustainability\ninitiatives, including\nin relation to climate\ntransition.\n                                              \n  Compliance Risk Management                  \n                                              \nCompliance risk is the\nrisk of legal or\nregulatory sanctions,\nmaterial financial\nloss or damage to our\nreputation arising\nfrom our failure to\ncomply with the\nrequirements of\napplicable laws, rules\nand regulations, and\nour internal policies\nand procedures.\nCompliance risk is\ninherent in all\nactivities through\nwhich we conduct our\nbusinesses. Our\nCompliance Risk\nManagement Program,\nadministered by\nCompliance, assesses\nour compliance,\nregulatory and\nreputational risk;\nmonitors for\ncompliance with new or\namended laws, rules\nand regulations;\ndesigns and implements\ncontrols, policies,\nprocedures and\ntraining; conducts\nindependent testing;\ninvestigates, surveils\nand monitors for\ncompliance risks and\nbreaches; and leads\nour responses to\nregulatory\nexaminations, audits\nand inquiries. We\nmonitor and review\nbusiness practices to\nassess whether they\nmeet or exceed minimum\nregulatory and legal\nstandards in all\nmarkets and\njurisdictions in which\nwe conduct business.\nConflicts Management\nConflicts of interest\nand our approach to\ndealing with them are\nfundamental to our\nclient relationships,\nour reputation and our\nlong-term success. The\nterm \u201cconflict of\ninterest\u201d does not\nhave a universally\naccepted meaning, and\nconflicts can arise in\nmany forms within a\nbusiness or between\nbusinesses. The\nresponsibility for\nidentifying potential\nconflicts, as well as\ncomplying with our\npolicies and\nprocedures, is shared\nby all of our\nemployees.\n\nWe have a multilayered\napproach to resolving\nconflicts and\naddressing\nreputational risk.

We have estimated the upper\nend of the range of reasonably possible\naggregate loss for matters where we have been\nable to estimate a range and we believe, based\non currently available information, that the\nresults of matters where we have not been able\nto estimate a range of reasonably possible\nloss, in the aggregate, will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial\ncondition, but may be material to our\noperating results in a given period. Given the\nrange of litigation and investigations\npresently under way, our litigation expenses\nmay remain high.
