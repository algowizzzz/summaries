(e) On October 21, 2021, \npursuant to a recommendation from its         \nCompensation Committee, the Board of Directors\n(the Board) of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.  \n(Goldman Sachs or the Registrant) granted     \n73,264 performance-based restricted stock     \nunits (each, a PSU) to Chairman and Chief     \nExecutive Officer David M. Solomon ($17.0     \nmillion grant date fair value (1)) and 48,843 \nPSUs to President and Chief Operating Officer \nJohn E. Waldron ($11.4 million grant date fair\nvalue (1)) (together, the Shareholder Value   \nCreation Award). The Shareholder Value        \nCreation Award is a stock-based award that is \nsubject to both performance and time-based    \nvesting conditions and is designed to directly\ntie longer-term pay outcomes to shareholder   \nvalue creation in a balanced manner that does \nnot encourage imprudent risk taking. In       \ngranting the Shareholder Value Creation Award,\nthe Board intended to address three key       \nobjectives: (1) ensure leadership continuity  \nover the next 5+ years in the next phase of   \nGoldman Sachs\u2019 growth strategy; (2) align     \ncompensation with rigorous performance        \nthresholds that drive long-term shareholder   \nvalue creation; and (3) enhance retention in  \nresponse to the rapidly increasing war for    \ntalent in the current environment. The        \nShareholder Value Creation Award is not part  \nof Messrs. Solomon\u2019s or Waldron\u2019s regular     \nannual compensation and will not be awarded on\na regularly recurring basis. The Shareholder  \nValue Creation Award\u2019s performance-based      \nvesting is based 50% on absolute total        \nshareholder return (TSR) goals and 50% on     \nrelative TSR goals, all of which have been    \npre-establishedby the Board. The overall      \npayout percentage of the Shareholder Value    \nCreation Award will equal the sum of the      \npercentage of Target Earned under each of the \nCumulative Absolute TSR Goals and Relative TSR\nGoals. Amounts earned are determined by linear\ninterpolation if results are between the TSR  \ngoals (both absolute and relative). Vesting   \nwill be determined over a five-year           \nperformance period beginning on the grant     \ndate, based on the following goals:           \n                                              \n  Cumula\u2026    % of        Relative    % of     \n  Absolu\u2026    Target      TSR         Target   \n  TSR\u00a0       Earned      Goals       Earned   \n  Goals*                                      \n  \u00b375%       75%         \u00b380th       75%      \n                         Percent\u2026             \n  60%        50%         65th        50%      \n                         Percent\u2026             \n  47%        25%         40th        25%      \n                         Percent\u2026             \n  <47%       0%          <40th       0%       \n                         Percent\u2026             \n                                              \n* Resulting stock price plus dividends would  \nbe ~$602 at 47%, ~$655 at 60%, and ~$717 at   \n75%, in each case assuming a $2 quarterly     \ndividend. The number of initial PSUs granted  \nto each of Messrs. Solomon and Waldron was    \ndetermined based on a stock price of $409.48  \n(the five-dayaverage closing price from       \nOctober 15, 2021 through October 21, 2021),   \nwhich stock price will also be used to        \ncalculate achievement of the absolute TSR     \ngoals. The peer group for relative TSR is Bank\nof America Corporation, Citigroup Inc.,       \nJPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, The Bank\nof New York Mellon Corporation and Wells Fargo\n& Company. Vesting is also subject to         \ncontinuous service with Goldman Sachs until   \nthe end of the five-year performance period,  \nwith limited exceptions provided in the       \napplicable award agreement and the Goldman    \nSachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive    \nPlan (2021) (the SIP), such as death and      \ndisability. Any amounts earned under the      \nShareholder Value Creation Award are settled  \nin shares of common stock of Goldman Sachs    \nthat will deliver at the end of the           \nperformance period, on or about the fifth     \nanniversary of the date of grant of the award.\nThese shares will be subject to transfer      \nrestrictions for one additional year after    \ndelivery, and also will be subject to         \nforfeiture and clawback provisions, including \nrecapture for events constituting \u201cCause,\u201d    \nfailing to perform obligations under any      \nagreement with Goldman Sachs, and             \nparticipating in (or otherwise overseeing or  \nbeing responsible for, depending on the       \ncircumstances, another individual\u2019s           \nparticipation) materially improper risk       \nanalysis or failing sufficiently to raise     \nconcerns about risks during the performance   \nperiod.
