The Goldman Sachs     \nGroup, Inc. (the \u201cRegistrant,\u201d the \u201cfirm\u201d or  \n\u201cwe\u201d) today announced that the Board of       \nDirectors (\u201cBoard\u201d), upon the recommendation  \nof the Compensation Committee, has determined \nthe 2023 total annual compensation for David  \nSolomon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Solomon\u2019s total annual compensation for   \n2023 is $31 million (which consists of an     \nannual base salary of $2 million, unchanged   \nyear-over-year, as well as annual variable    \ncompensation of $29 million). Seventy percent \nof this annual variable compensation (i.e.,   \n$20.3 million) is in the form of performance- \nbased restricted stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), which  \ntie 100% of Mr. Solomon\u2019s equity-based        \ncompensation to ongoing performance metrics,  \nwith the remainder to be paid in cash. This   \ncompares to Mr. Solomon\u2019s total annual        \ncompensation for 2022 of $25 million. The     \nCompensation Committee was guided in its      \ndetermination of 2023 compensation by, among  \nother things, the firm\u2019s Assessment Framework,\nwhich is comprised of identified financial    \nperformance metrics as well as non-           \nfinancialfactors (i.e., strategic priorities  \nand client orientation, risk management and   \ncontrols, and people strategy scorecard). In  \nmaking its determinations, the Compensation   \nCommittee considered, among other things:     \n                                              \n       Mr.\u00a0Solomon\u2019s decisive leadership in   \n  \u2022    recognizing the need to clarify and    \n       simplify the firm\u2019s forward strategy,  \n                                              \n                                              \n       The firm\u2019s swift execution on a        \n  \u2022    series of actions that narrowed its    \n       strategic focus and strengthened the   \n       firm\u2019s platform for 2024 and beyond,   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Continued progress on strategic        \n  \u2022    priorities in the firm\u2019s core          \n       franchises: Global Banking\u00a0& Markets   \n       and Asset\u00a0& Wealth Management,         \n                                              \n                                              \n       The firm\u2019s ongoing emphasis on         \n  \u2022    delivering long-term value for         \n       shareholders,                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Mr.\u00a0Solomon\u2019s steadfast focus on       \n  \u2022    client centricity and One Goldman      \n       Sachs as foundational to the firm,     \n                                              \n                                              \n       His dedicated commitment to the        \n  \u2022    firm\u2019s culture, Core Values and        \n       advancing the firm\u2019s people strategy,  \n       and                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       The firm\u2019s demonstrated investment to  \n  \u2022    promote the strength of the firm\u2019s     \n       risk management and control            \n       environment.                           \n                                              \nThe Committee also considered the firm\u2019s 2023 \nfinancial performance, both on an absolute    \nbasis and relative to peer results as well as \nin the context of the 2023 operating          \nenvironment and longer-term results. The      \nCompensation Committee recognized that these  \nresults were affected by a number of factors, \nsuch as strong client franchise performance,  \nincluding leading positions across Global     \nBanking & Markets, but also the execution of  \nthe firm\u2019s own initiatives to narrow its      \nstrategic focus. While these strategic actions\nnegatively impacted short-term performance,   \nthe Compensation Committee believes that the  \nactions of senior management were critical to \nreorienting the firm with a much stronger     \nplatform for 2024 and beyond. For the year    \nended December 31, 2023, the Registrant       \nreported full-year net revenues of $46.25     \nbillion, net earnings of $8.52 billion,       \ndiluted earnings per common share of $22.87   \nand return on average common shareholders\u2019    \nequity of 7.5%. For 2023, the firm also       \ndelivered book value per share growth of 3.3%.\nThe firm\u2019s full-year 2023 results were        \nimpacted by selected items related to the     \nexecution of the firm\u2019s narrowed strategic    \nfocus, in addition to the FDIC special        \nassessment fee. These items reduced 2023 net  \nearnings by $2.8 billion, EPS by $8.04 and ROE\nby 2.6 percentage points.                     \n                                              \nSIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, the          \nregistrant has duly caused this report to be  \nsigned on its behalf by the undersigned       \nhereunto duly authorized.                     \n                                              \n                                  (Registra\u2026  \n  Date:              THE GOLDMAN  /s/         \n  February\u00a0          SACHS        Kathryn H.  \n  16, 2024      By:  GROUP, INC.
