The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a      \nvoting interest entity or a variable interest \nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)   \nthe total equity investment at risk is        \nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity  \nholders have the power to direct the          \nactivities of the entity that most            \nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the    \nentity and the right to receive the residual  \nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting  \ninterest entity is ownership of a majority    \nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest \nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable  \nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that    \nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a \nvoting interest entity. The firm has a        \ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when  \nthe firm has a variable interest or interests \nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct  \nthe activities of the VIE that most           \nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic       \nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb \nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive     \nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially  \nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for    \nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method \nInvestments. When the firm does not have a    \ncontrolling financial interest in an entity   \nbut can exert significant influence over the  \nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair \nvalue by electing the fair value option       \navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant        \ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns \n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstancecommon stock. In certain cases, the  \nfirm applies the equity method of accounting  \nto new investments that are strategic in      \nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s       \nprincipal business activities, when the firm  \nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or   \nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less     \nsignificant. See Note 8 for further           \ninformation about equity-method investments.  \n                                          \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    6  \n                                          \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investment Funds. The firm has    \nformed investment funds with third-party      \ninvestors. These funds are typically organized\nas limited partnerships or limited liability  \ncompanies for which the firm acts as general  \npartner or manager. Generally, the firm does  \nnot hold a majority of the economic interests \nin these funds. These funds are usually voting\ninterest entities and generally are not       \nconsolidated because third-party investors    \ntypically have rights to terminate the funds  \nor to remove the firm as general partner or   \nmanager. Investments in these funds are       \ngenerally measured at net asset value (NAV)   \nand are included in investments. See Notes 8, \n18 and 22 for further information about       \ninvestments in funds. Use of Estimates        \nPreparation of these consolidated financial   \nstatements requires management to make certain\nestimates and assumptions, the most important \nof which relate to fair value measurements,   \nthe allowance for credit losses on loans and  \nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,    \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and provisions for losses    \nthat may arise from tax audits. These         \nestimates and assumptions are based on the    \nbest available information but actual results \ncould be materially different. Revenue        \nRecognition Financial Assets and Liabilities  \nat Fair Value. Trading assets and liabilities \nand certain investments are recorded at fair  \nvalue either under the fair value option or in\naccordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, \nthe firm has elected to account for certain of\nits loans and other financial assets and      \nliabilities at fair value by electing the fair\nvalue option. The fair value of a financial   \ninstrument is the amount that would be        \nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer \na liability in an orderly transaction between \nmarket participants at the measurement date.  \nFinancial assets are marked to bid prices and \nfinancial liabilities are marked to offer     \nprices. Fair value measurements do not include\ntransaction costs. Fair value gains or losses \nare generally included in market making or    \nother principal transactions. See Note 4 for  \nfurther information about fair value          \nmeasurements. Revenue from Contracts with     \nClients. The firm recognizes revenue earned   \nfrom contracts with clients for services, such\nas investment banking, investment management, \nand execution and clearing (contracts with    \nclients), when the performance obligations    \nrelated to the underlying transaction are     \ncompleted. Revenues from these contracts with \nclients represent approximately 40% of total  \nnon-interestrevenues for the three months     \nended June 2020 and 45% for the six months    \nended June 2020 (including approximately 85%  \nof investment banking revenues, approximately \n95% of investment management revenues and all \ncommissions and fees), and approximately 45%  \nof total non-interestrevenues for each of the \nthree and six months ended June 2019          \n(including approximately 90% of investment    \nbanking revenues, approximately 95% of        \ninvestment management revenues and all        \ncommissions and fees) for each of the three   \nand six months ended June 2019. See Note 25   \nfor information about net revenues by business\nsegment. Investment Banking Advisory. Fees    \nfrom financial advisory assignments are       \nrecognized in revenues when the services      \nrelated to the underlying transaction are     \ncompleted under the terms of the assignment.  \nNon-refundabledeposits and milestone payments \nin connection with financial advisory         \nassignments are recognized in revenues upon   \ncompletion of the underlying transaction or   \nwhen the assignment is otherwise concluded.   \nExpenses associated with financial advisory   \nassignments are recognized when incurred and  \nare included in other expenses. Client        \nreimbursements for such expenses are included \nin investment banking revenues. Underwriting. \nFees from underwriting assignments are        \nrecognized in revenues upon completion of the \nunderlying transaction based on the terms of  \nthe assignment. Expenses associated with      \nunderwriting assignments are generally        \ndeferred until the related revenue is         \nrecognized or the assignment is otherwise     \nconcluded. Such expenses are included in other\nexpenses.                                     \n                                          \n  7    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                          \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investment Management The firm    \nearns management fees and incentive fees for  \ninvestment management services, which are     \nincluded in investment management revenues.   \nThe firm makes payments to brokers and        \nadvisors related to the placement of the      \nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),  \nwhich are included in brokerage, clearing,    \nexchange and distribution fees. Management    \nFees. Management fees for mutual funds are    \ncalculated as a percentage of daily net asset \nvalue and are received monthly. Management    \nfees for hedge funds and separately managed   \naccounts are calculated as a percentage of    \nmonth-endnet asset value and are generally    \nreceived quarterly. Management fees for       \nprivate equity funds are calculated as a      \npercentage of monthly invested capital or     \ncommitted capital and are received quarterly, \nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the   \nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.      \nDistribution fees paid by the firm are        \ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net     \nasset value or the committed capital. Such    \nfees are included in brokerage, clearing,     \nexchange and distribution fees. Incentive     \nFees. Incentive fees are calculated as a      \npercentage of a fund\u2019s or separately managed  \naccount\u2019s return, or excess return above a    \nspecified benchmark or other performance      \ntarget. Incentive fees are generally based on \ninvestment performance over a twelve-month    \nperiod or over the life of a fund. Fees that  \nare based on performance over a twelve-month  \nperiod are subject to adjustment prior to the \nend of the measurement period. For fees that  \nare based on investment performance over the  \nlife of the fund, future investment           \nunderperformance may require fees previously  \ndistributed to the firm to be returned to the \nfund. Incentive fees earned from a fund or    \nseparately managed account are recognized when\nit is probable that a significant reversal of \nsuch fees will not occur, which is generally  \nwhen such fees are no longer subject to       \nfluctuations in the market value of           \ninvestments held by the fund or separately    \nmanaged account. Therefore, incentive fees    \nrecognized during the period may relate to    \nperformance obligations satisfied in previous \nperiods. Commissions and Fees The firm earns  \ncommissions and fees from executing and       \nclearing client transactions on stock, options\nand futures markets, as well as over-the-     \ncounter(OTC) transactions. Commissions and    \nfees are recognized on the day the trade is   \nexecuted. The firm also provides third-party  \nresearch services to clients in connection    \nwith certain soft-dollar arrangements. Third- \nparty research costs incurred by the firm in  \nconnection with such arrangements are         \npresented net within commissions and fees.    \nRemaining Performance Obligations Remaining   \nperformance obligations are services that the \nfirm has committed to perform in the future in\nconnection with its contracts with clients.   \nThe firm\u2019s remaining performance obligations  \nare generally related to its financial        \nadvisory assignments and certain investment   \nmanagement activities. Revenues associated    \nwith remaining performance obligations        \nrelating to financial advisory assignments    \ncannot be determined until the outcome of the \ntransaction. For the firm\u2019s investment        \nmanagement activities, where fees are         \ncalculated based on the net asset value of the\nfund or separately managed account, future    \nrevenues associated with such remaining       \nperformance obligations cannot be determined  \nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in   \nthe market value of investments held by the   \nfund or separately managed account. The firm  \nis able to determine the future revenues      \nassociated with management fees calculated    \nbased on committed capital. As of June 2020,  \nsubstantially all future net revenues         \nassociated with such remaining performance    \nobligations will be recognized through 2027.  \nAnnual revenues associated with such          \nperformance obligations average less than $   \n250million through 2027. Transfers of         \nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has  \nrelinquished control over the assets          \ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses   \nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or     \nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s        \ncontinuing involvement with transferred       \nfinancial assets are initially recognized at  \nfair value. For transfers of financial assets \nthat are not accounted for as sales, the      \nassets are generally included in trading      \nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a \ncollateralized financing, with the related    \ninterest expense recognized over the life of  \nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further      \ninformation about transfers of financial      \nassets accounted for as collateralized        \nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted \nfor as sales.                                 \n                                          \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    8  \n                                          \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Such receivables primarily consist of   \ncustomer margin loans, receivables resulting  \nfrom unsettled transactions and collateral    \nposted in connection with certain derivative  \ntransactions. Substantially all of these      \nreceivables are accounted for at amortized    \ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,  \nwhich generally approximates fair value. As   \nthese receivables are not accounted for at    \nfair value, they are not included in the      \nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through\n10. Had these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of   \nboth June 2020 and December 2019. See Note 10 \nfor further information about customer and    \nother receivables accounted for at fair value \nunder the fair value option. Interest on      \ncustomer and other receivables is recognized  \nover the life of the transaction and included \nin interest income. Customer and other        \nreceivables includes receivables from         \ncontracts with clients and contract assets.   \nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to \nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s    \nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n2.72billion as of June 2020 and $ 2.27billion \nas of December 2019. As of both June 2020 and \nDecember 2019 contract assets were not        \nmaterial.

Such   \npayables primarily consist of customer credit \nbalances related to the firm\u2019s prime brokerage\nactivities. Customer and other payables are   \naccounted for at cost plus accrued interest,  \nwhich generally approximates fair value. As   \nthese payables are not accounted for at fair  \nvalue, they are not included in the firm\u2019s    \nfair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10.   \nHad these payables been included in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy, substantially all would \nhave been classified in level 2 as of both    \nJune 2020 and December 2019. Interest on      \ncustomer and other payables is recognized over\nthe life of the transaction and included in   \ninterest expense. Offsetting Assets and       \nLiabilities To reduce credit exposures on     \nderivatives and securities financing          \ntransactions, the firm may enter into master  \nnetting agreements or similar arrangements    \n(collectively, netting agreements) with       \ncounterparties that permit it to offset       \nreceivables and payables with such            \ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a      \ncontract with a counterparty that permits net \nsettlement of multiple transactions with that \ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of  \ntermination rights by a non-defaultingparty.  \nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all \ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is \ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with     \nrespect to its derivatives and securities     \nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms  \nof the related credit support agreements or   \nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit    \nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit    \nsupport agreement grants the non-             \ndefaultingparty exercising termination rights \nthe right to liquidate the collateral and     \napply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In    \norder to assess enforceability of the firm\u2019s  \nright of setoff under netting and credit      \nsupport agreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in   \nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the        \nagreement.                                    \n                                          \n  9    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                          \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See \nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about  \noffsetting assets and liabilities. Share-based\nCompensation The cost of employee services    \nreceived in exchange for a share-based award  \nis generally measured based on the grant-date \nfair value of the award. Share-based awards   \nthat do not require future service (i.e.,     \nvested awards, including awards granted to    \nretirement-eligible employees) are expensed   \nimmediately. Share-based awards that require  \nfuture service are amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recorded when \nthey occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on \noutstanding restricted stock units (RSUs) are \ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that    \nrequire future service are forfeited, the     \nrelated dividend equivalents originally       \ncharged to retained earnings are reclassified \nto compensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues  \nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of   \nshare-based awards. In certain cases,         \nprimarily related to conflicted employment (as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements), \nthe firm may cash settle share-based          \ncompensation awards accounted for as equity   \ninstruments. For these awards, whose terms    \nallow for cash settlement, additional paid-   \nincapital is adjusted to the extent of the    \ndifference between the value of the award at  \nthe time of cash settlement and the grant-date\nvalue of the award. The tax effect related to \nthe settlement of share-based awards is       \nrecorded in income tax benefit or expense.    \nForeign Currency Translation Assets and       \nliabilities denominated in non-U.S.currencies \nare translated at rates of exchange prevailing\non the date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at   \naverage rates of exchange for the period.     \nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies   \nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a  \nnon-U.S.operation, when the functional        \ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are   \nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the     \nconsolidated statements of comprehensive      \nincome. Recent Accounting Developments Leases \n(ASC 842). In February 2016, the FASB issued  \nASU No. 2016-02,\u201cLeases (Topic 842).\u201d This ASU\nrequires that, for leases longer than one     \nyear, a lessee recognize in the balance sheet \na right-of-useasset, representing the right to\nuse the underlying asset for the lease term,  \nand a lease liability, representing the       \nliability to make lease payments. It also     \nrequires that for finance leases, a lessee    \nrecognize interest expense on the lease       \nliability, separately from the amortization of\nthe right-of-useasset in the statements of    \nearnings, while for operating leases, such    \namounts should be recognized as a combined    \nexpense. It also requires that for qualifying \nsale-leaseback transactions the seller        \nrecognize any gain or loss (based on the      \nestimated fair value of the asset at the time \nof sale) when control of the asset is         \ntransferred instead of amortizing it over the \nlease period. In addition, this ASU requires  \nexpanded disclosures about the nature and     \nterms of lease agreements. The firm adopted   \nthis ASU in January 2019 under a modified     \nretrospective approach. Upon adoption, in     \naccordance with the ASU, the firm elected to  \nnot reassess the lease classification or      \ninitial direct costs of existing leases, and  \nto not reassess whether existing contracts    \ncontain a lease. In addition, the firm has    \nelected to account for each contract\u2019s lease  \nand non-leasecomponents as a single lease     \ncomponent. The impact of adoption was a gross \nup of $ 1.77billion on the firm\u2019s consolidated\nbalance sheet and an increase to retained     \nearnings of $ 12million (net of tax) as of    \nJanuary 1, 2019.                              \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    10  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Measurement of Credit Losses on   \nFinancial Instruments (ASC 326). In June 2016,\nthe FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,\u201cFinancial    \nInstruments \u2014 Credit Losses (Topic 326) \u2014     \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial     \nInstruments.\u201d This ASU amends several aspects \nof the measurement of credit losses on certain\nfinancial instruments, including replacing the\nexisting incurred credit loss model and other \nmodels with the Current Expected Credit Losses\n(CECL) model and amending certain aspects of  \naccounting for purchased financial assets with\ndeterioration in credit quality since         \norigination. The firm adopted this ASU in     \nJanuary 2020 under a modified retrospective   \napproach. As a result of adopting this ASU,   \nthe firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses on     \nfinancial assets and commitments that are     \nmeasured at amortized cost reflects           \nmanagement\u2019s estimate of credit losses over   \nthe remaining expected life of such assets.   \nExpected credit losses for newly recognized   \nfinancial assets and commitments, as well as  \nchanges to expected credit losses during the  \nperiod, are recognized in earnings. These     \nexpected credit losses are measured based on  \nhistorical experience, current conditions and \nforecasts that affect the collectability of   \nthe reported amount. The cumulative effect of \nmeasuring the allowance under CECL as a result\nof adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020 was\nan increase in the allowance for credit losses\nof $ 848million. The increase in the allowance\nis driven by the fact that the allowance under\nCECL covers expected credit losses over the   \nfull expected life of the loan portfolios and \nalso takes into account forecasts of expected \nfuture economic conditions. In addition, in   \naccordance with the ASU, the firm elected the \nfair value option for loans that were         \npreviously accounted for as Purchased Credit  \nImpaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease  \nto the allowance for PCI loans of $           \n169million. The cumulative effect of adopting \nthis ASU was a decrease to retained earnings  \nof $ 638million (net of tax). Facilitation of \nthe Effects of Reference Rate Reform on       \nFinancial Reporting (ASC 848). In March 2020, \nthe FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04,\u201cReference    \nRate Reform \u2014 Facilitation of the Effects of  \nReference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\u201d\nThis ASU provides optional exceptions for     \napplying generally accepted accounting        \nprinciples to contracts, hedging relationships\nand other transactions affected by reference  \nrate reform. The firm adopted this ASU in     \nMarch 2020 and adoption did not have a        \nmaterial impact on the firm\u2019s consolidated    \nfinancial statements. Note 4. Fair Value      \nMeasurements The fair value of a financial    \ninstrument is the amount that would be        \nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer \na liability in an orderly transaction between \nmarket participants at the measurement date.  \nFinancial assets are marked to bid prices and \nfinancial liabilities are marked to offer     \nprices. Fair value measurements do not include\ntransaction costs. The firm measures certain  \nfinancial assets and liabilities as a         \nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to \nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active  \nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by    \nreference to prices for similar instruments,  \nquoted prices or recent transactions in less  \nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or            \nindependently sourced inputs, including, but  \nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities, \nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding  \nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference       \nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower \ncould finance a given financial instrument    \nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.  \nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for          \ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This   \nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation \ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving \nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based \non the lowest level of input that is          \nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In \nevaluating the significance of a valuation    \ninput, the firm considers, among other        \nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to   \nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as    \nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical, \nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.  \nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are       \nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values \nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial \nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain  \nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and      \nliabilities may require valuation adjustments \nthat a market participant would require to    \narrive at fair value for factors, such as     \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,   \nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments  \nare generally based on market evidence.       \n                                           \n  11    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See Notes 5  \nthrough 10 for further information about      \nsignificant unobservable inputs used to value \nlevel 3 financial instruments. Valuation      \nTechniques and Significant Inputs for Trading \nCash Instruments, Investments and Loans Level \n1. Level 1 instruments include U.S. government\nobligations, most non-U.S.government          \nobligations, certain agency obligations,      \ncertain corporate debt instruments, certain   \nmoney market instruments and actively traded  \nlisted equities. These instruments are valued \nusing quoted prices for identical unrestricted\ninstruments in active markets. The firm       \ndefines active markets for equity instruments \nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market  \ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm   \ndefines active markets for debt instruments   \nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity. \nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain  \nnon-U.S.government obligations, most agency   \nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and   \nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,  \nmost state and municipal obligations, most    \nmoney market instruments, most other debt     \nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed \nequities, certain private equities,           \ncommodities and certain lending commitments.  \nValuations of level 2 instruments can be      \nverified to quoted prices, recent trading     \nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative    \npricing sources with reasonable levels of     \nprice transparency. Consideration is given to \nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor firm) and the relationship of recent market\nactivity to the prices provided from          \nalternative pricing sources. Valuation        \nadjustments are typically made to level 2     \ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject  \nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair   \nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally    \nbased on market evidence. Level 3.

Credit default   \n       swaps that reference indices, large    \n       corporates and major sovereigns        \n       generally exhibit the most price       \n       transparency. For credit default       \n       swaps with other underliers, price     \n       transparency varies based on credit    \n       rating, the cost of borrowing the      \n       underlying reference obligations, and  \n  \u2022    the availability of the underlying     \n       reference obligations for delivery     \n       upon the default of the issuer.        \n       Credit default swaps that reference    \n       loans, asset-backed securities and     \n       emerging market debt instruments tend  \n       to have less price transparency than   \n       those that reference corporate bonds.  \n       In addition, more complex credit       \n       derivatives, such as those sensitive   \n       to the correlation between two or      \n       more underlying reference              \n       obligations, generally have less       \n       price transparency.                    \n                                              \n                                           \n  13    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Price transparency      \n       varies based on the underlying         \n  \u2022    commodity, delivery location, tenor    \n       and product quality (e.g., diesel      \n       fuel compared to unleaded gasoline).   \n       In general, price transparency for     \n       commodity derivatives is greater for   \n       contracts with shorter tenors and      \n       contracts that are more closely        \n       aligned with major and/or benchmark    \n       commodity indices.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Equity.Price transparency for equity   \n       derivatives varies by market and       \n       underlier. Options on indices and the  \n       common stock of corporates included    \n       in major equity indices exhibit the    \n       most price transparency.

The significant\nunobservable inputs\nused to value the\nfirm\u2019s level 3\nderivatives are\ndescribed below.\n                                              \n       For level\u00a03 interest rate and          \n       currency derivatives, significant      \n       unobservable inputs include            \n       correlations of certain currencies     \n       and interest rates (e.g., the          \n  \u2022    correlation between Euro inflation     \n       and Euro interest rates). In           \n       addition, for level\u00a03 interest rate    \n       derivatives, significant unobservable  \n       inputs include specific interest rate  \n       volatilities.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       For level\u00a03 credit derivatives,        \n       significant unobservable inputs        \n       include illiquid credit spreads and    \n       upfront credit points, which are       \n       unique to specific reference           \n  \u2022    obligations and reference entities,    \n       recovery rates and certain             \n       correlations required to value credit  \n       derivatives (e.g., the likelihood of   \n       default of the underlying reference    \n       obligation relative to one another).   \n                                              \n                                              \n       For level\u00a03 commodity derivatives,     \n       significant unobservable inputs        \n       include volatilities for options with  \n       strike prices that differ              \n  \u2022    significantly from current market      \n       prices and prices or spreads for       \n       certain products for which the         \n       product quality or physical location   \n       of the commodity is not aligned with   \n       benchmark indices.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       For level\u00a03 equity derivatives,        \n       significant unobservable inputs        \n       generally include equity volatility    \n       inputs for options that are            \n       long-dated and/or have strike prices   \n       that differ significantly from         \n       current market prices. In addition,    \n  \u2022    the valuation of certain structured    \n       trades requires the use of level\u00a03     \n       correlation inputs, such as the        \n       correlation of the price performance   \n       of two or more individual stocks or    \n       the correlation of the price           \n       performance for a basket of stocks to  \n       another asset class, such as           \n       commodities.                           \n                                              \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    14  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Subsequent to the initial         \nvaluation of a level 3 derivative, the firm   \nupdates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to     \nreflect observable market changes and any     \nresulting gains and losses are classified in  \nlevel 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when      \ncorroborated by evidence, such as similar     \nmarket transactions, third-party pricing      \nservices and/or broker or dealer quotations or\nother empirical market data. In circumstances \nwhere the firm cannot verify the model value  \nby reference to market transactions, it is    \npossible that a different valuation model     \ncould produce a materially different estimate \nof fair value. See Note 7 for further         \ninformation about significant unobservable    \ninputs used in the valuation of level 3       \nderivatives. Valuation Adjustments. Valuation \nadjustments are integral to determining the   \nfair value of derivative portfolios and are   \nused to adjust the mid-marketvaluations       \nproduced by derivative pricing models to the  \nexit price valuation. These adjustments       \nincorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of    \nliquidity, credit valuation adjustments and   \nfunding valuation adjustments, which account  \nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in   \nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative    \nportfolios. The firm also makes funding       \nvaluation adjustments to collateralized       \nderivatives where the terms of the agreement  \ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge \ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are  \ngenerally used when calibrating valuation     \nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In     \naddition, for derivatives that include        \nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm     \nmakes model or exit price adjustments to      \naccount for the valuation uncertainty present \nin the transaction. Valuation Techniques and  \nSignificant Inputs for Other Financial        \nInstruments at Fair Value In addition to      \ntrading cash instruments, derivatives, and    \ncertain investments and loans, the firm       \naccounts for certain of its other financial   \nassets and liabilities at fair value under the\nfair value option. Such instruments include   \nrepurchase agreements and substantially all   \nresale agreements; securities borrowed and    \nloaned in Fixed Income, Currency and          \nCommodities (FICC) financing; certain customer\nand other receivables, including certain      \nmargin loans; certain time deposits, including\nstructured certificates of deposit, which are \nhybrid financial instruments; substantially   \nall other secured financings, including       \ntransfers of assets accounted for as          \nfinancings and collateralized central bank    \nfinancings; certain unsecured short- and long-\nterm borrowings, substantially all of which   \nare hybrid financial instruments; and other   \nliabilities. These instruments are generally  \nvalued based on discounted cash flow          \ntechniques, which incorporate inputs with     \nreasonable levels of price transparency, and  \nare generally classified in level 2 because   \nthe inputs are observable. Valuation          \nadjustments may be made for liquidity and for \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality.   \nThe significant inputs used to value the      \nfirm\u2019s other financial instruments are        \ndescribed below. Resale and Repurchase        \nAgreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of    \nresale and repurchase agreements and          \nsecurities borrowed and loaned are funding    \nspreads, the amount and timing of expected    \nfuture cash flows and interest rates. Customer\nand Other Receivables. The significant inputs \nto the valuation of receivables are interest  \nrates, the amount and timing of expected      \nfuture cash flows and funding spreads.        \nDeposits. The significant inputs to the       \nvaluation of time deposits are interest rates \nand the amount and timing of future cash      \nflows. The inputs used to value the embedded  \nderivative component of hybrid financial      \ninstruments are consistent with the inputs    \nused to value the firm\u2019s other derivative     \ninstruments described above. See Note 7 for   \nfurther information about derivatives and Note\n13 for further information about deposits.    \nOther Secured Financings. The significant     \ninputs to the valuation of other secured      \nfinancings are the amount and timing of       \nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,   \nfunding spreads, the fair value of the        \ncollateral delivered by the firm (determined  \nusing the amount and timing of expected future\ncash flows, market prices, market yields and  \nrecovery assumptions) and the frequency of    \nadditional collateral calls. See Note 11 for  \nfurther information about other secured       \nfinancings. Unsecured Short- and Long-Term    \nBorrowings. The significant inputs to the     \nvaluation of unsecured short- and long-term   \nborrowings are the amount and timing of       \nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,   \nthe credit spreads of the firm and commodity  \nprices for prepaid commodity transactions. The\ninputs used to value the embedded derivative  \ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are \nconsistent with the inputs used to value the  \nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described \nabove. See Note 7 for further information     \nabout derivatives and Note 14 for further     \ninformation about borrowings. Other           \nLiabilities. The significant inputs to the    \nvaluation of other liabilities are the amount \nand timing of expected future cash flows and  \nequity volatility and correlation inputs.

For example,  \n       the highest recovery rate for          \n       corporate debt instruments is          \n  \u2022    appropriate for valuing a specific     \n       corporate debt instrument, but may     \n       not be appropriate for valuing any     \n       other corporate debt instrument.       \n       Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do   \n       not represent uncertainty in, or       \n       possible ranges of, fair value         \n       measurements of level\u00a03 trading cash   \n       instruments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increases in yield, duration or        \n       cumulative loss rate used in the       \n       valuation of level\u00a03 trading cash      \n       instruments would have resulted in a   \n       lower fair value measurement, while    \n       increases in recovery rate would have  \n  \u2022    resulted in a higher fair value        \n       measurement as of both June\u00a02020 and   \n       December\u00a02019.

Note 7. Derivatives and Hedging  \nActivities Derivative Activities Derivatives  \nare instruments that derive their value from  \nunderlying asset prices, indices, reference   \nrates and other inputs, or a combination of   \nthese factors. Derivatives may be traded on an\nexchange (exchange-traded) or they may be     \nprivately negotiated contracts, which are     \nusually referred to as OTC derivatives.       \nCertain of the firm\u2019s OTC derivatives are     \ncleared and settled through central clearing  \ncounterparties (OTC-cleared),while others are \nbilateral contracts between two counterparties\n(bilateral OTC).                              \nMarket Making. As a\nmarket maker, the firm\nenters into derivative\ntransactions to provide\nliquidity to clients\nand to facilitate the\ntransfer and hedging of\ntheir risks. In this\nrole, the firm\ntypically acts as\nprincipal and is\nrequired to commit\ncapital to provide\nexecution, and\nmaintains market-making\npositions in response\nto, or in anticipation\nof, client demand.\n\nRisk Management. The\nfirm also enters into\nderivatives to actively\nmanage risk exposures\nthat arise from its\nmarket-making and\ninvesting and financing\nactivities. The firm\u2019s\nholdings and exposures\nare hedged, in many\ncases, on either a\nportfolio or risk-\nspecific basis, as\nopposed to an\ninstrument-by-\ninstrumentbasis. The\noffsetting impact of\nthis economic hedging\nis reflected in the\nsame business segment\nas the related\nrevenues. In addition,\nthe firm may enter into\nderivatives designated\nas hedges under U.S.\nGAAP. These derivatives\nare used to manage\ninterest rate exposure\nin certain fixed-rate\nunsecured long- and\nshort-term borrowings,\nand deposits, and to\nmanage foreign currency\nexposure on the net\ninvestment in certain\nnon-U.S.operations.\n\nThe firm enters into\nvarious types of\nderivatives, including:\n                                              \n       Futures and Forwards.Contracts that    \n       commit counterparties to purchase or   \n  \u2022    sell financial instruments,            \n       commodities or currencies in the       \n       future.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Swaps.Contracts that require           \n       counterparties to exchange cash        \n       flows, such as currency or interest    \n       payment streams. The amounts           \n  \u2022    exchanged are based on the specific    \n       terms of the contract with reference   \n       to specified rates, financial          \n       instruments, commodities, currencies   \n       or indices.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Options.Contracts in which the option  \n       purchaser has the right, but not the   \n       obligation, to purchase from or sell   \n  \u2022    to the option writer financial         \n       instruments, commodities or            \n       currencies within a defined time       \n       period for a specified price.          \n                                              \nDerivatives are\nreported on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for\nderivative assets and\nliabilities for a given\ncounterparty) when a\nlegal right of setoff\nexists under an\nenforceable netting\nagreement (counterparty\nnetting). Derivatives\nare accounted for at\nfair value, net of cash\ncollateral received or\nposted under\nenforceable credit\nsupport agreements\n(cash collateral\nnetting).

Credit\nderivatives are\ngenerally individually\nnegotiated contracts\nand can have various\nsettlement and payment\nconventions. Credit\nevents include failure\nto pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of\nindebtedness,\nrestructuring,\nrepudiation and\ndissolution of the\nreference entity.\n\nThe firm enters into\nthe following types of\ncredit derivatives:\n                                              \n       Credit Default Swaps.Single-name       \n       credit default swaps protect the       \n       buyer against the loss of principal    \n       on one or more bonds, loans or         \n       mortgages (reference obligations) in   \n       the event the issuer of the reference  \n       obligations suffers a credit event.    \n       The buyer of protection pays an        \n       initial or periodic premium to the     \n  \u2022    seller and receives protection for     \n       the period of the contract. If there   \n       is no credit event, as defined in the  \n       contract, the seller of protection     \n       makes no payments to the buyer. If a   \n       credit event occurs, the seller of     \n       protection is required to make a       \n       payment to the buyer, calculated       \n       according to the terms of the          \n       contract.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit Options.In a credit option,     \n       the option writer assumes the          \n       obligation to purchase or sell a       \n       reference obligation at a specified    \n       price or credit spread. The option     \n       purchaser buys the right, but does     \n  \u2022    not assume the obligation, to sell     \n       the reference obligation to, or        \n       purchase it from, the option writer.   \n       The payments on credit options depend  \n       either on a particular credit spread   \n       or the price of the reference          \n       obligation.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit Indices, Baskets and            \n       Tranches.Credit derivatives may        \n       reference a basket of single-name      \n       credit default swaps or a broad-based  \n       index. If a credit event occurs in     \n       one of the underlying reference        \n       obligations, the protection seller     \n       pays the protection buyer. The         \n       payment is typically apro-rataportion  \n       of the transaction\u2019s total notional    \n  \u2022    amount based on the underlying         \n       defaulted reference obligation. In     \n       certain transactions, the credit risk  \n       of a basket or index is separated      \n       into various portions (tranches),      \n       each having different levels of        \n       subordination. The most junior         \n       tranches cover initial defaults and    \n       once losses exceed the notional        \n       amount of these junior tranches, any   \n       excess loss is covered by the next     \n       most senior tranche.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Total Return Swaps.A total return      \n       swap transfers the risks relating to   \n       economic performance of a reference    \n       obligation from the protection buyer   \n       to the protection seller. Typically,   \n       the protection buyer receives a        \n  \u2022    floating rate of interest and          \n       protection against any reduction in    \n       fair value of the reference            \n       obligation, and the protection seller  \n       receives the cash flows associated     \n       with the reference obligation, plus    \n       any increase in the fair value of the  \n       reference obligation.                  \n                                              \nThe firm economically\nhedges its exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives with\nidentical underliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a particular\nwritten credit\nderivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default.\n\nAs of June 2020,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a total\ngross notional amount\nof $ 525.89billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a total\ngross notional amount\nof $ 580.53billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection of\n$ 54.64billion. As of\nDecember 2019, written\ncredit derivatives had\na total gross notional\namount of $\n522.57billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a total\ngross notional amount\nof $ 581.76billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection of\n$ 59.19billion.

These\ninterest rate swaps\nhedge changes in fair\nvalue attributable to\nthe designated\nbenchmark interest\nrate (e.g., London\nInterbank Offered Rate\n(LIBOR), Secured\nOvernight Financing\nRate or Overnight\nIndex Swap Rate),\neffectively converting\na substantial portion\nof fixed-rate\nobligations into\nfloating-rate\nobligations.\nThe firm applies a\nstatistical method\nthat utilizes\nregression analysis\nwhen assessing the\neffectiveness of its\nfair value hedging\nrelationships in\nachieving offsetting\nchanges in the fair\nvalues of the hedging\ninstrument and the\nrisk being hedged\n(i.e., interest rate\nrisk). An interest\nrate swap is\nconsidered highly\neffective in\noffsetting changes in\nfair value\nattributable to\nchanges in the hedged\nrisk when the\nregression analysis\nresults in a\ncoefficient of\ndetermination of 80%\nor greater and a slope\nbetween 80% and 125%.\nFor qualifying fair\nvalue hedges, gains or\nlosses on derivatives\nare included in\ninterest expense. The\nchange in fair value of\nthe hedged item\nattributable to the\nrisk being hedged is\nreported as an\nadjustment to its\ncarrying value (hedging\nadjustment) and is also\nincluded in interest\nexpense. When a\nderivative is no longer\ndesignated as a hedge,\nany remaining\ndifference between the\ncarrying value and par\nvalue of the hedged\nitem is amortized to\ninterest expense over\nthe remaining life of\nthe hedged item using\nthe effective interest\nmethod.

Equity securities and debt instruments,\nat fair value include investments in funds    \nthat are measured at NAV of the investment    \nfund. The firm uses NAV to measure the fair   \nvalue of fund investments when (i) the fund   \ninvestment does not have a readily            \ndeterminable fair value and (ii) the NAV of   \nthe investment fund is calculated in a manner \nconsistent with the measurement principles of \ninvestment company accounting, including      \nmeasurement of the investments at fair value. \nSubstantially all of the firm\u2019s investments in\nfunds at NAV consist of investments in firm-  \nsponsored private equity, credit, real estate \nand hedge funds where the firm co-investswith \nthird-party investors. Private equity funds   \nprimarily invest in a broad range of          \nindustries worldwide, including leveraged     \nbuyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments\nand distressed investments. Credit funds      \ngenerally invest in loans and other fixed     \nincome instruments and are focused on         \nproviding private high-yield capital for      \nleveraged and management buyout transactions, \nrecapitalizations, financings, refinancings,  \nacquisitions and restructurings for private   \nequity firms, private family companies and    \ncorporate issuers. Real estate funds invest   \nglobally, primarily in real estate companies, \nloan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and   \nproperty. Private equity, credit and real     \nestate funds are closed-endfunds in which the \nfirm\u2019s investments are generally not eligible \nfor redemption. Distributions will be received\nfrom these funds as the underlying assets are \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. The firm also invests in hedge  \nfunds, primarily multi-disciplinary hedge     \nfunds that employ a fundamental bottom-       \nupinvestment approach across various asset    \nclasses and strategies. The firm\u2019s investments\nin hedge funds primarily include interests    \nwhere the underlying assets are illiquid in   \nnature, and proceeds from redemptions will not\nbe received until the underlying assets are   \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. Private equity, hedge and real  \nestate funds described above are primarily    \n\u201ccovered funds\u201d as defined in the Volcker Rule\nof the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve     \nSystem (FRB) extended the conformance period  \nto July 2022 for the firm\u2019s investments in,   \nand relationships with, certain legacy        \n\u201cilliquid funds\u201d (as defined in the Volcker   \nRule) that were in place prior to December    \n2013.

For example, the highest   \n       multiple for private equity            \n  \u2022    securities is appropriate for valuing  \n       a specific private equity security     \n       but may not be appropriate for         \n       valuing any other private equity       \n       security. Accordingly, the ranges of   \n       inputs do not represent uncertainty    \n       in, or possible ranges of, fair value  \n       measurements of level\u00a03 investments.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increases in yield, discount rate,     \n       capitalization rate or duration used   \n       in the valuation of level\u00a03            \n       investments would have resulted in a   \n       lower fair value measurement, while    \n       increases in recovery rate or          \n  \u2022    multiples would have resulted in a     \n       higher fair value measurement as of    \n       both June\u00a02020 and December\u00a02019. Due  \n       to the distinctive nature of each      \n       level\u00a03 investment, the                \n       interrelationship of inputs is not     \n       necessarily uniform within each        \n       product type.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Corporate debt securities, securities  \n       backed by real estate and other debt   \n       obligations are valued using           \n  \u2022    discounted cash flows, and equity      \n       securities are valued using market     \n       comparables and discounted cash        \n       flows.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       The fair value of any one instrument   \n       may be determined using multiple       \n       valuation techniques.

Therefore, the   \n       level\u00a03 balance encompasses both of    \n       these techniques.                      \n                                              \nLevel 3 Rollforward                           \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level 3\ninvestments.\n                                              \n        Th\u2026                 Six               \n        Mo\u2026                 Mo\u2026               \n        En\u2026                 En\u2026               \n        Ju\u2026                 Ju\u2026               \n  $                                           \n  in    20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026     \n  m\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026    $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026     40        21       121        71     \n  g\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  u\u2026    (1\u2026  )    367       (1\u2026  )    505     \n  g\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    344       315       811       524     \n  S\u2026    (1\u2026  )    (4\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (5\u2026  )  \n  S\u2026    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (5\u2026  )    (3\u2026  )  \n  T\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026    428       1,\u2026       5,\u2026       2,\u2026     \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  T\u2026                                          \n  o\u2026                                          \n  of    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )  \n  l\u2026                                          \n  3                                           \n  E\u2026    $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026       $1\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       Changes in fair value are presented    \n  \u2022    for all investments that are           \n       classified in level\u00a03 as of the end    \n       of the period.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates  \n  \u2022    to investments that were still held    \n       atperiod-end.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Transfers between levels of the fair   \n       value hierarchy are reported at the    \n       beginning of the reporting period in   \n  \u2022    which they occur.

Loans accounted\nfor at amortized cost\n(other than credit card\nloans) are placed on\nnonaccrual status when\nit is probable that the\nfirm will not collect\nall principal and\ninterest due under the\ncontractual terms,\nregardless of the\ndelinquency status or\nif a loan is past due\nfor 90 days or more,\nunless the loan is both\nwell collateralized and\nin the process of\ncollection. At that\ntime, all accrued but\nuncollected interest is\nreversed against\ninterest income and\ninterest subsequently\ncollected is recognized\non a cash basis to the\nextent the loan balance\nis deemed collectible.\nOtherwise, all cash\nreceived is used to\nreduce the outstanding\nloan balance. A loan is\nconsidered past due\nwhen a principal or\ninterest payment has\nnot been made according\nto its contractual\nterms. Credit card\nloans are not placed on\nnonaccrual status and\naccrue interest until\nthe loan is paid in\nfull or is charged-off.\n\nIn certain\ncircumstances, the firm\nmay modify the original\nterms of a loan\nagreement by granting a\nconcession to a\nborrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty,\ntypically in the form\nof a modification of\nloan covenants, but may\nalso include\nforbearance of interest\nor principal, payment\nextensions or interest\nrate reductions.

As a result, the\nfirm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses effective\nJanuary\u00a02020 reflects\nmanagement\u2019s estimate\nof credit losses over\nthe remaining expected\nlife of such loans and\nalso considers\nforecasts of future\neconomic conditions.\nPrior to January\u00a02020,\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses reflected\nprobable incurred\ncredit losses. See\nNote\u00a03 for further\ninformation about the\nadoption of CECL.\n\nTo determine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, the firm\nclassifies its loans\nand lending commitments\naccounted for at\namortized cost into\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios. Prior to\nJanuary 2020, the firm\nalso had PCI loans\nwhich were classified\nas a separate\nportfolio. These\nportfolios represent\nthe level at which the\nfirm has developed and\ndocumented its\nmethodology to\ndetermine the allowance\nfor credit losses. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses is measured on a\ncollective basis for\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics using a\nmodeled approach and\nasset-specific basis\nfor loans that do not\nshare similar risk\ncharacteristics.\n\nUnder CECL, the\nallowance for credit\nlosses takes into\naccount the weighted\naverage of a range of\nforecasts of future\neconomic conditions\nover the expected life\nof the loan and lending\ncommitments. The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on the\ncontractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios over\na three-year period.\nFor loans with expected\nlives beyond three\nyears, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear modeled\napproach. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios described\nbelow. The firm applies\njudgment in weighing\nindividual scenarios\neach quarter based on a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding the firm\u2019s\ninternally derived\neconomic outlook,\nmarket consensus,\nrecent macroeconomic\nconditions and industry\ntrends.\n\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses also\nincludes qualitative\ncomponents which allow\nmanagement to reflect\nthe uncertain nature of\neconomic forecasting\nand account for model\nimprecision and\nconcentration risk.\n\nManagement\u2019s estimate\nof credit losses\nentails judgment about\nloan collectability at\nthe reporting dates,\nand there are\nuncertainties inherent\nin those judgments. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses is subject to a\ngovernance process that\ninvolves review and\napproval by senior\nmanagement within the\nfirm\u2019s independent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions. Personnel\nwithin the firm\u2019s\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions are\nresponsible for\nforecasting the\neconomic variables that\nunderlie the economic\nscenarios that are used\nin the modeling of\nexpected credit losses.\nWhile management uses\nthe best information\navailable to determine\nthis estimate, future\nadjustments to the\nallowance may be\nnecessary based on,\namong other things,\nchanges in the economic\nenvironment or\nvariances between\nactual results and the\noriginal assumptions\nused.\nThe table below\npresents gross loans\nand lending commitments\naccounted for at\namortized cost by\nportfolio.\n                                              \n          As of                               \n           June              Dece\u2026            \n           2020               2019            \n  $ in    Loans    Lendi\u2026    Loans    Commi\u2026  \n  mil\u2026             Commi\u2026                     \n  Who\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026    $54,\u2026    $106,\u2026    $41,\u2026    $127,\u2026  \n  Wea\u2026    20,2\u2026     2,756    20,1\u2026     2,198  \n  man\u2026                                        \n  Com\u2026                                        \n  real    14,3\u2026     3,005    12,8\u2026     3,207  \n  est\u2026                                        \n  Res\u2026                                        \n  real    4,426     1,097    4,965       759  \n  est\u2026                                        \n  Oth\u2026    3,685     3,781    3,396     3,029  \n  Con\u2026                                        \n  Ins\u2026    4,466         5    4,747        12  \n  Cre\u2026    2,282    17,486    1,858    13,669  \n  car\u2026                                        \n  PCI         \u2013         \u2013    1,622         \u2013  \n  Tot\u2026    $104\u2026    $134,\u2026    $90,\u2026    $150,\u2026  \n                                              \n                                           \n  39    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) In the table above, wholesale     \nloans included $ 3.97billion as of June 2020  \nand $ 1.49billion as of December 2019 of      \nnonaccrual loans for which the allowance for  \ncredit losses was measured on an asset-       \nspecific basis. The allowance for credit      \nlosses on these loans was $ 610million as of  \nJune 2020 and $ 207million as of December     \n2019. These loans included $ 876million as of \nJune 2020 and $ 754million as of December 2019\nof loans which did not require a reserve as   \nthe loan was deemed to be recoverable. See    \nNote 18 for further information about lending \ncommitments. The following is a description of\nthe methodology used to calculate the         \nallowance for credit losses: Wholesale. The   \nallowance for credit losses for wholesale     \nloans and lending commitments that exhibit    \nsimilar risk characteristics is measured using\na modeled approach. These models determine the\nprobability of default and loss given default \nbased on various risk factors, including      \ninternal credit ratings, industry default and \nloss data, expected life, macroeconomic       \nindicators, the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet   \nits financial obligations, the borrower\u2019s     \ncountry of risk and industry, loan seniority  \nand collateral type. For lending commitments, \nthe methodology also considers probability of \ndrawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans  \nbacked by real estate, risk factors include   \nthe loan-to-valueratio, debt service ratio and\nhome price index. The most significant inputs \nto the forecast model for wholesale loans and \nlending commitments include unemployment      \nrates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and    \nindustrial delinquency rates, short- and long-\nterm interest rates, andoil prices. The       \nallowance for loan losses for wholesale loans \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics, such as nonaccrual loans or  \nloans in a troubled debt restructuring, is    \ncalculated using the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s    \noriginal effective rate, the observable market\nprice of the loan or the fair value of the    \ncollateral. Wholesale loans are charged-      \noffagainst the allowance for loan losses when \ndeemed to be uncollectible. Consumer. The     \nallowance for credit losses for consumer loans\nthat exhibit similar risk characteristics is  \ncalculated using a modeled approach which     \nclassifies consumer loans into pools based on \nborrower-related and exposure-related         \ncharacteristics that differentiate a pool\u2019s   \nrisk characteristics from other pools. The    \nfactors considered in determining a pool are  \ngenerally consistent with the risk            \ncharacteristics used for internal credit risk \nmeasurement and management and include key    \nmetrics, such as FICO credit scores,          \ndelinquency status, loan vintage and          \nmacroeconomic indicators. The most significant\ninputs to the forecast model for consumer     \nloans include unemployment rates and          \ndelinquency rates. The expected life of       \nrevolving credit card loans is determined by  \nmodeling expected future draws and the timing \nand amount of repayments allocated to the     \nfunded balance. The firm does not recognize an\nallowance for credit losses on credit card    \nlending commitments as they are cancellable by\nthe firm. The allowance for credit losses for \nconsumer loans that do not share similar risk \ncharacteristics, such as loans in a troubled  \ndebt restructuring, is calculated using the   \npresent value of expected future cash flows   \ndiscounted at the loan\u2019s original effective   \nrate. Installment loans are charged-offwhen   \nthey are 120 days past due.

Rollforward\nCommentary\n\nSix Months Ended June\n2020. The allowance\nfor credit losses\nincreased by $\n2.59billion during the\nsix months ended June\n2020.\n\nThe impact of CECL\nadoption for wholesale\nand consumer loans was\ndriven by the fact\nthat the allowance\nunder CECL covers\nexpected credit losses\nover the full expected\nlife of the loan\nportfolios and also\nconsiders forecasts of\nexpected future\neconomic conditions.\nThe impact of CECL\nadoption for PCI loans\nwas as a result of the\nfirm electing to apply\nthe fair value option\nfor such loans.\nThe provision for credit losses for wholesale \nand consumer loans reflected the continued    \nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic   \nconditions, which resulted in higher modeled  \nexpected losses and lower recoveries. The     \nallowance for loan losses ratio for wholesale \nloans increased to 2.8% as of June 2020       \ncompared with 1.1% as of December 2019, while \nthe allowance for loan losses ratio for       \nconsumer loans increased to 17.0% as of June  \n2020 compared with 6.0% as of December 2019.  \nThe increase in the allowance for loan losses \nratio sreflected both the impact of adopting  \nthe CECL standard, as well as higher provision\nfor credit losses. When modeling expected     \ncredit losses, the firm employs a weighted,   \nmultivariate forecast, which includes         \nbaseline, adverse and favorable economic      \nscenarios. As of June 2020, the forecasted    \neconomic scenarios were most heavily weighted \ntowards the baseline and adverse scenarios.   \nThe forecasted range for the U.S. unemployment\nrate in the three scenarios is 6.5% to 15.0%  \nat December 2020 and 4.2% to 9.0% at June     \n2021. The forecasted range of the decline in  \nU.S. GDP for 2020 in the three scenarios is   \n3.8% to 6.7%. The forecasted range of the     \ndecline in U.S. GDP for the second quarter of \n2021 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 \n(pre-pandemic) in the three scenarios is 0.1% \nto 4.1%, with the timing of the recovery of   \nquarterly U.S. GDP to its pre-pandemic level  \nin the three scenarios ranging from the       \nquarters ending June 2021 to June 2022. The   \nforecast model incorporates adjustments to    \nreflect the impact of COVID-19-related        \nconcession programs on delinquency rates and  \nalso considers the impact of the CARES Act and\nother economic support programs provided by   \nnational governments. While the unemployment  \nrate and GDP are significant inputs to the    \nforecast model, the model contemplates a      \nvariety of other inputs across a range of     \nscenarios to provide a forecast of future     \neconomic conditions. Given the complex nature \nof the forecasting process, no single economic\nvariable can be viewed in isolation and       \nindependently of other inputs. In addition,   \nthe provision for credit losses for wholesale \nloans was impacted by ratings downgrades and  \nasset-specific provisions primarily related to\nborrowers in the technology media and         \ncommunication, diversified industrials, and   \noil and gas industries. Besides the weaker    \neconomic outlook related to the COVID-19      \npandemic, the provision for credit losses for \nconsumer loans for the six months ended June  \n2020 was also impacted by the continued       \nseasoning of the credit card portfolio. Net   \ncharge-offs for the six months ended June 2020\nfor wholesale loans were substantially        \nallrelated to corporate loans and net charge- \noffs for consumer loans were primarilyrelated \nto installment loans.                         \n                                           \n  41    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Even though repurchase and resale       \nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d)involve the legal transfer of       \nownership of financial instruments, they are  \naccounted for as financing arrangements       \nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the  \nmaturity of the agreement. The financial      \ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and   \nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.  \ngovernment and agency, and investment-grade   \nsovereign obligations. The firm receives      \nfinancial instruments purchased under resale  \nagreements and makes delivery of financial    \ninstruments sold under repurchase agreements. \nTo mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these financial           \ninstruments on a daily basis, and delivers or \nobtains additional collateral due to changes  \nin the market value of the financial          \ninstruments, as appropriate. For resale       \nagreements, the firm typically requires       \ncollateral with a fair value approximately    \nequal to the carrying value of the relevant   \nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.    \nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions In\na securities borrowed transaction, the firm   \nborrows securities from a counterparty in     \nexchange for cash or securities. When the firm\nreturns the securities, the counterparty      \nreturns the cash or securities. Interest is   \ngenerally paid periodically over the life of  \nthe transaction. In a securities loaned       \ntransaction, the firm lends securities to a   \ncounterparty in exchange for cash or          \nsecurities. When the counterparty returns the \nsecurities, the firm returns the cash or      \nsecurities posted as collateral. Interest is  \ngenerally paid periodically over the life of  \nthe transaction. The firm receives securities \nborrowed and makes delivery of securities     \nloaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm \nmonitors the market value of these securities \non a daily basis, and delivers or obtains     \nadditional collateral due to changes in the   \nmarket value of the securities, as            \nappropriate. For securities borrowed          \ntransactions, the firm typically requires     \ncollateral with a fair value approximately    \nequal to the carrying value of the securities \nborrowed transaction.                         \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    50  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative assessment.\nThe quantitative\ngoodwill test compares\nthe estimated fair\nvalue of each reporting\nunit with its estimated\nnet book value\n(including goodwill and\nidentifiable intangible\nassets). If the\nreporting unit\u2019s\nestimated fair value\nexceeds its estimated\nnet book value,\ngoodwill is not\nimpaired. An impairment\nis recognized if the\nestimated fair value of\na reporting unit is\nless than its estimated\nnet book value.\n\nTo estimate the fair\nvalue of each reporting\nunit, other than\nConsumer banking, a\nrelative value\ntechnique is used\nbecause the firm\nbelieves market\nparticipants would use\nthis technique to value\nthese reporting units.\nThe relative value\ntechnique applies\nobservable price-to-\nearnings multiples or\nprice-to-book multiples\nof comparable\ncompetitors to\nreporting units\u2019 net\nearnings or net book\nvalue. To estimate the\nfair value of Consumer\nbanking, a discounted\ncash flow valuation\napproach is used\nbecause the firm\nbelieves market\nparticipants would use\nthis technique to value\nthat reporting unit\ngiven its early stage\nof development. The\nestimated net carrying\nvalue of each reporting\nunit reflects an\nallocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nand represents the\nestimated amount of\ntotal shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    54  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During the first   \nquarter of 2020, the outbreak of the          \nCOVID-19pandemic broadly impacted the         \noperating environment, notably in March.      \nUncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic       \npersisted throughout the second quarter of    \n2020 and continued to impact economic and     \nmarket conditions. Multiple factors, including\nperformance indicators, firm and industry     \nevents, macroeconomic indicators and fair     \nvalue indicators, were qualitatively assessed \nin the second quarter of 2020 with respect to \neach of the firm\u2019s reporting units to         \ndetermine whether it was more likely than not \nthat the estimated fair value of any of these \nreporting units was less than its estimated   \ncarrying value. The qualitative assessment    \nalso considered changes since the quantitative\ntest performed in the fourth quarter of 2019. \nDespite challenges to the firm\u2019s operating    \nenvironment, net revenues for the second      \nquarter of 2020 were strong across the firm\u2019s \nbusiness segments and their respective        \nreporting units. Based on the qualitative     \nassessment, the firm determined that it was   \nmore likely than not that the estimated fair  \nvalue of each of the reporting units exceeded \nits respective estimated carrying value, and  \nthat the impact of the COVID-19pandemic       \nthrough the end of the second quarter of 2020 \nwas not a triggering event to perform a       \nquantitative test.                            \nIdentifiable Intangible\nAssets.

Securitization Activities The firm   \nsecuritizes residential and commercial        \nmortgages, corporate bonds, loans and other   \ntypes of financial assets by selling these    \nassets to securitization vehicles (e.g.,      \ntrusts, corporate entities and limited        \nliability companies) or through a             \nresecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter\nof the beneficial interests that are sold to  \ninvestors. The firm\u2019s residential mortgage    \nsecuritizations are primarily in connection   \nwith government agency securitizations. The   \nfirm accounts for a securitization as a sale  \nwhen it has relinquished control over the     \ntransferred financial assets. Prior to        \nsecuritization, the firm generally accounts   \nfor assets pending transfer at fair value and \ntherefore does not typically recognize        \nsignificant gains or losses upon the transfer \nof assets. Net revenues from underwriting     \nactivities are recognized in connection with  \nthe sales of the underlying beneficial        \ninterests to investors.                       \nThe firm generally\nreceives cash in\nexchange for the\ntransferred assets but\nmay also have\ncontinuing involvement\nwith the transferred\nfinancial assets,\nincluding ownership of\nbeneficial interests in\nsecuritized financial\nassets, primarily in\nthe form of debt\ninstruments. The firm\nmay also purchase\nsenior or subordinated\nsecurities issued by\nsecuritization vehicles\n(which are typically\nVIEs) in connection\nwith secondary market-\nmaking activities.\n\nThe primary risks\nincluded in beneficial\ninterests and other\ninterests from the\nfirm\u2019s continuing\ninvolvement with\nsecuritization vehicles\nare the performance of\nthe underlying\ncollateral, the\nposition of the firm\u2019s\ninvestment in the\ncapital structure of\nthe securitization\nvehicle and the market\nyield for the security.\nInterests accounted for\nat fair value are\nclassified in level 2\nof the fair value\nhierarchy.

The firm        \nreassesses its determination of whether it is \nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and              \ncircumstances. VIE Activities The firm is     \nprincipally involved with VIEs through the    \nfollowing business activities: Mortgage-Backed\nVIEs. The firm sells residential and          \ncommercial mortgage loans and securities to   \nmortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial\ninterests in the assets sold to these VIEs.   \nThe firm purchases and sells beneficial       \ninterests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in   \nconnection with market-making activities. In  \naddition, the firm may enter into derivatives \nwith certain of these VIEs, primarily interest\nrate swaps, which are typically not variable  \ninterests. The firm generally enters into     \nderivatives with other counterparties to      \nmitigate its risk. Real Estate, Credit- and   \nPower-Related and Other Investing VIEs. The   \nfirm purchases equity and debt securities     \nissued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold   \nreal estate, performing and nonperforming     \ndebt, distressed loans, power-related assets  \nand equity securities. The firm generally does\nnot sell assets to, or enter into derivatives \nwith, these VIEs. Corporate Debt and Other    \nAsset-Backed VIEs. The firm structures VIEs   \nthat issue notes to clients, purchases and    \nsells beneficial interests issued by corporate\ndebt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection\nwith market-making activities, and makes loans\nto VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain\nof these VIEs synthetically create the        \nexposure for the beneficial interests they    \nissue by entering into credit derivatives with\nthe firm, rather than purchasing the          \nunderlying assets. In addition, the firm may  \nenter into derivatives, such as total return  \nswaps, with certain corporate debt and other  \nasset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays  \nthe VIE a return due to the beneficial        \ninterest holders and receives the return on   \nthe collateral owned by the VIE. The          \ncollateral owned by these VIEs is primarily   \nother asset-backed loans and securities. The  \nfirm may be removed as the total return swap  \ncounterparty and may enter into derivatives   \nwith other counterparties to mitigate its risk\nrelated to these swaps. The firm may sell     \nassets to the corporate debt and other asset- \nbacked VIEs it structures.                    \n                                           \n  63    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs\nown portfolios of\nassets, principally\nwith exposure to hedge\nfunds. Substantially\nall of the principal\nprotection on the\nnotes issued by these\nVIEs is provided by\nthe asset portfolio\nrebalancing that is\nrequired under the\nterms of the notes.\nThe firm enters into\ntotal return swaps\nwith these VIEs under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE the return due\nto the principal-\nprotected note holders\nand receives the\nreturn on the assets\nowned by the VIE.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Commercial Lending. The firm\u2019s    \ncommercial lending commitments were primarily \nextended to investment-grade corporate        \nborrowers. Such commitments primarily included\n$ 98.86billion as of June 2020 and $          \n102.50billion as of December 2019, related to \nrelationship lending activities (principally  \nused for operating and general corporate      \npurposes) and $ 11.01billion as of June 2020  \nand $ 33.47billion as of December 2019,       \nrelated to other investment banking activities\n(generally extended for contingent acquisition\nfinancing and are often intended to be short- \nterm in nature, as borrowers often seek to    \nreplace them with other funding sources). The \nfirm also extends lending commitments in      \nconnection with other types of corporate      \nlending, as well as commercial real estate    \nfinancing. See Note 9 for further information \nabout funded loans. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial \nGroup, Inc. (SMFG) provides the firm with     \ncredit loss protection on certain approved    \nloan commitments (primarily investment-grade  \ncommercial lending commitments). The notional \namount of such loan commitments was $         \n3.72billion as of June 2020 and $ 5.74billion \nas of December 2019. The credit loss          \nprotection on loan commitments provided by    \nSMFG is generally limited to 95% of the first \nloss the firm realizes on such commitments, up\nto a maximum of approximately $ 950million. In\naddition, subject to the satisfaction of      \ncertain conditions, upon the firm\u2019s request,  \nSMFG will provide protection for 70% of       \nadditional losses on such commitments, up to a\nmaximum of $ 750million, of which noprotection\nhad been provided as of June 2020 and December\n2019. The firm also uses other financial      \ninstruments to mitigate credit risks related  \nto certain commitments not covered by SMFG.   \nThese instruments primarily include credit    \ndefault swaps that reference the same or      \nsimilar underlying instrument or entity, or   \ncredit default swaps that reference a credit  \nindex. Warehouse Financing. The firm provides \nfinancing to clients who warehouse financial  \nassets. These arrangements are secured by the \nwarehoused assets, primarily consisting of    \nresidential real estate, consumer and         \ncorporate loans. Credit Cards. The firm\u2019s     \ncredit card lending commitments represents    \ncredit card lines issued by the firm to       \nconsumers. These credit card lines are        \ncancelable by the firm. Collateralized        \nAgreement Commitments/ Collateralized         \nFinancing Commitments Collateralized agreement\ncommitments includes forward starting resale  \nand securities borrowing agreements, and      \ncollateralized financing commitments includes \nforward starting repurchase and secured       \nlending agreements that settle at a future    \ndate, generally within three business days.   \nCollateralized agreement commitments also     \nincludes transactions where the firm has      \nentered into commitments to provide contingent\nfinancing to its clients and counterparties   \nthrough resale agreements. The firm\u2019s funding \nof these commitments depends on the           \nsatisfaction of all contractual conditions to \nthe resale agreement and these commitments can\nexpire unused. Letters of Credit The firm has \ncommitments under letters of credit issued by \nvarious banks which the firm provides to      \ncounterparties in lieu of securities or cash  \nto satisfy various collateral and margin      \ndeposit requirements. Investment Commitments  \nInvestment commitments includes commitments to\ninvest in private equity, real estate and     \nother assets directly and through funds that  \nthe firm raises and manages. Investment       \ncommitments included $ 2.10billion as of June \n2020 and $ 2.06billion as of December 2019,   \nrelated to commitments to invest in funds     \nmanaged by the firm. If these commitments are \ncalled, they would be funded at market value  \non the date of investment. Contingencies Legal\nProceedings. See Note 27 for information about\nlegal proceedings, including certain mortgage-\nrelated matters. Certain Mortgage-Related     \nContingencies. During the period 2005 through \n2008 in connection with both sales and        \nsecuritizations of loans, the firm provided   \nloan-level representations and/or assigned the\nloan-level representations from the party from\nwhom the firm purchased the loans. Based on   \nthe large number of defaults in residential   \nmortgages, including those sold or securitized\nby the firm, there is a potential for         \nrepurchase claims. However, the firm is not in\na position to make a meaningful estimate of   \nthat exposure at this time. The firm\u2019s        \nexposure to claims for repurchase of          \nresidential mortgage loans based on alleged   \nbreaches of representations will depend on a  \nnumber of factors, such as the extent to which\nthese claims are made within the statute of   \nlimitations, taking into consideration the    \nagreements to toll the statute of limitations \nthe firm entered into with trustees           \nrepresenting certain trusts. Other            \nContingencies.

The firm enters into   \nvarious derivatives that meet the definition  \nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including     \nwritten equity and commodity put options,     \nwritten currency contracts and interest rate  \ncaps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives \nare risk managed together with derivatives    \nthat do not meet the definition of a          \nguarantee, and therefore the amounts in the   \ntable above do not reflect the firm\u2019s overall \nrisk related to derivative activities.        \nDisclosures about derivatives are not required\nif they may be cash settled and the firm has  \nno basis to conclude it is probable that the  \ncounterparties held the underlying instruments\nat inception of the contract. The firm has    \nconcluded that these conditions have been met \nfor certain large, internationally active     \ncommercial and investment bank counterparties,\ncentral clearing counterparties, hedge funds  \nand certain other counterparties.Accordingly, \nthe firm has not included such contracts in   \nthe table above. See Note 7 for information   \nabout credit derivatives that meet the        \ndefinition of a guarantee, which are not      \nincluded in the table above. Derivatives are  \naccounted for at fair value and therefore the \ncarrying value is considered the best         \nindication of payment/performance risk for    \nindividual contracts. However, the carrying   \nvalues in the table above exclude the effect  \nof counterparty and cash collateral netting.  \nSecurities Lending Indemnifications. The firm,\nin its capacity as an agency lender,          \nindemnifies most of its securities lending    \ncustomers against losses incurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not return securities and   \nthe collateral held is insufficient to cover  \nthe market value of the securities borrowed.  \nCollateral held by the lenders in connection  \nwith securities lending indemnifications was $\n22.11billion as of June 2020 and $            \n19.14billion as of December 2019. Because the \ncontractual nature of these arrangements      \nrequires the firm to obtain collateral with a \nmarket value that exceeds the value of the    \nsecurities lent to the borrower, there is     \nminimal performance risk associated with these\nguarantees. Other Financial Guarantees. In the\nordinary course of business, the firm provides\nother financial guarantees of the obligations \nof third parties (e.g., standby letters of    \ncredit and other guarantees to enable clients \nto complete transactions and fund-related     \nguarantees). These guarantees represent       \nobligations to make payments to beneficiaries \nif the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its  \nobligation under a contractual arrangement    \nwith that beneficiary.                        \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    68  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Guarantees of Securities Issued by\nTrusts. The firm has established trusts,      \nincluding Goldman Sachs Capital I, the APEX   \nTrusts and other entities, for the limited    \npurpose of issuing securities to third        \nparties, lending the proceeds to the firm and \nentering into contractual arrangements with   \nthe firm and third parties related to this    \npurpose. The firm does not consolidate these  \nentities. See Note 14 for further information \nabout the transactions involving Goldman Sachs\nCapital I and the APEX Trusts. The firm       \neffectively provides for the full and         \nunconditional guarantee of the securities     \nissued by these entities. Timely payment by   \nthe firm of amounts due to these entities     \nunder the guarantee, borrowing, preferred     \nstock and related contractual arrangements    \nwill be sufficient to cover payments due on   \nthe securities issued by these entities.      \nManagement believes that it is unlikely that  \nany circumstances will occur, such as         \nnonperformance on the part of paying agents or\nother service providers, that would make it   \nnecessary for the firm to make payments       \nrelated to these entities other than those    \nrequired under the terms of the guarantee,    \nborrowing, preferred stock and related        \ncontractual arrangements and in connection    \nwith certain expenses incurred by these       \nentities. Indemnities and Guarantees of       \nService Providers. In the ordinary course of  \nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees \ncertain service providers, such as clearing   \nand custody agents, trustees and              \nadministrators, against specified potential   \nlosses in connection with their acting as an  \nagent of, or providing services to, the firm  \nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses   \narising from its custodial role or caused by  \nacts or omissions of third-party service      \nproviders, including sub-custodiansand third- \nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has \nthe right to seek indemnification from these  \nthird-party service providers for certain     \nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In      \naddition, the firm is a member of payment,    \nclearing and settlement networks, as well as  \nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of   \nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of   \nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In  \nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear \nand settle on behalf of its clients the       \ntransactions entered into by them with other  \nbrokerage firms. The firm\u2019s obligations in    \nrespect of such transactions are secured by   \nthe assets in the client\u2019s account, as well as\nany proceeds received from the transactions   \ncleared and settled by the firm on behalf of  \nthe client. In connection with joint venture  \ninvestments, the firm may issue loan          \nguarantees under which it may be liable in the\nevent of fraud, misappropriation,             \nenvironmental liabilities and certain other   \nmatters involving the borrower. The firm is   \nunable to develop an estimate of the maximum  \npayout under these guarantees and             \nindemnifications. However, management believes\nthat it is unlikely the firm will have to make\nany material payments under these             \narrangements, and no material liabilities     \nrelated to these guarantees and               \nindemnifications have been recognized in the  \nconsolidated balance sheets as of both June   \n2020 and December 2019. Other Representations,\nWarranties and Indemnifications. The firm     \nprovides representations and warranties to    \ncounterparties in connection with a variety of\ncommercial transactions and occasionally      \nindemnifies them against potential losses     \ncaused by the breach of those representations \nand warranties. The firm may also provide     \nindemnifications protecting against changes in\nor adverse application of certain U.S. tax    \nlaws in connection with ordinary-course       \ntransactions, such as securities issuances,   \nborrowings or derivatives. In addition, the   \nfirm may provide indemnifications to some     \ncounterparties to protect them in the event   \nadditional taxes are owed or payments are     \nwithheld, due either to a change in or an     \nadverse application of certain non-U.S.tax    \nlaws. These indemnifications generally are    \nstandard contractual terms and are entered    \ninto in the ordinary course of business.      \nGenerally, there are no stated or notional    \namounts included in these indemnifications,   \nand the contingencies triggering the          \nobligation to indemnify are not expected to   \noccur. The firm is unable to develop an       \nestimate of the maximum payout under these    \nguarantees and indemnifications. However,     \nmanagement believes that it is unlikely the   \nfirm will have to make any material payments  \nunder these arrangements, and no material     \nliabilities related to these arrangements have\nbeen recognized in the consolidated balance   \nsheets as of both June 2020 and December 2019.\n                                           \n  69    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In addition, Group Inc. has       \nprovided a guarantee to GS Bank USA related to\nassets that GS Bank USA has acquired from     \ncertain subsidiaries and affiliated funds of  \nGroup Inc., and Group Inc. has provided a     \nguarantee to Goldman Sachs International (GSI)\nrelated to agreements that GSI has entered    \ninto with certain of its counterparties.

Shareholders\u2019 Equity      \nCommon Equity As of both June 2020 and        \nDecember 2019, the firm had 4.00billion       \nauthorized shares of common stock and         \n200million authorized shares of nonvoting     \ncommon stock, each with a par value of $      \n0.01per share.

Market\nRWAs are calculated\nbased on measures of\nexposure which include\nthe following:\n                                              \n       Value-at-Risk(VaR) is the potential    \n       loss in value of trading assets and    \n       liabilities, as well as certain        \n       investments, loans, and other          \n  \u2022    financial assets and liabilities       \n       accounted for at fair value, due to    \n       adverse market movements over a        \n       defined time horizon with a specified  \n       confidence level.                      \n                                              \nFor both risk\nmanagement purposes and\nregulatory capital\ncalculations, the firm\nuses a single VaR model\nwhich captures risks,\nincluding those related\nto interest rates,\nequity prices, currency\nrates and commodity\nprices. However, VaR\nused for risk\nmanagement purposes\ndiffers from VaR used\nfor regulatory capital\nrequirements\n(regulatory VaR) due to\ndifferences in time\nhorizons, confidence\nlevels and the scope of\npositions on which VaR\nis calculated. For risk\nmanagement purposes, a\n95 % one-day VaR is\nused, whereas for\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, a 99 %\n10-day VaR is used to\ndetermine Market RWAs\nand a 99 % one-day VaR\nis used to determine\nregulatory VaR\nexceptions. In\naddition, the daily net\nrevenues used to\ndetermine risk\nmanagement VaR\nexceptions (i.e.,\ncomparing the daily net\nrevenues to the VaR\nmeasure calculated as\nof the end of the prior\nbusiness day) include\nintraday activity,\nwhereas the Capital\nFramework requires that\nintraday activity be\nexcluded from daily net\nrevenues when\ncalculating regulatory\nVaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity\nincludes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are\nmore likely than not to\nbe positive by their\nnature. As a result,\nthere may be\ndifferences in the\nnumber of VaR\nexceptions and the\namount of daily net\nrevenues calculated for\nregulatory VaR compared\nto the amounts\ncalculated for risk\nmanagement VaR.\n\nThe firm\u2019s positional\nlosses observed on a\nsingle day exceeded its\n99 % one-day regulatory\nVaR on six occasions\nduring the six months\nended June\u00a02020 and\nexceeded its 99 % one-\nday regulatory VaR on\none occasion during the\nyear ended\nDecember\u00a02019. These\nexceptions did not\nimpact the VaR\nmultiplier used to\ncalculate Market RWAs\nas of June\u00a02020.\nThrough\nSeptember\u00a030,\u00a02020, the\nFRB is permitting\naffected banking\ninstitutions, including\nthe firm, to continue\nto apply the VaR\nmultiplier that applied\nas of December\u00a031,\u00a02019\nto determine Market\nRWAs, rather than a\nhigher multiplier based\non the most recent\nexceptions;\n                                              \n       Stressed VaR is the potential loss in  \n       value of trading assets and            \n       liabilities, as well as certain        \n  \u2022    investments, loans, and other          \n       financial assets and liabilities       \n       accounted for at fair value, during a  \n       period of significant market stress;   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Incremental risk is the potential      \n       loss in value                          \n  \u2022    ofnon-securitizedpositions due to the  \n       default or credit migration of         \n       issuers of financial instruments over  \n       aone-yeartime horizon;                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Comprehensive risk is the potential    \n  \u2022    loss in value, due to price risk and   \n       defaults, within the firm\u2019s credit     \n       correlation positions; and             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Specific risk is the risk of loss on   \n       a position that could result from      \n       factors other than broad market        \n       movements, including event risk,       \n  \u2022    default risk and idiosyncratic risk.   \n       The standardized measurement method    \n       is used to determine specific risk     \n       RWAs, by applying supervisory defined  \n       risk-weighting factors after           \n       applicable netting is performed.       \n                                              \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    76  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

This increase was   \npartially offset by a decrease in equity      \ninvestments, primarily due to reduced         \nexposures.

Standardized Credit RWAs as of December \n2019 increased by $ 25.65billion compared with\nDecember 2018, primarily reflecting an        \nincrease in commitments, guarantees and loans,\nprincipally due to an increase in lending     \nactivity, and an increase in other credit     \nRWAs, principally due to the recognition of   \noperating lease right-of-useassets upon       \nadoption of ASU No. 2016-02and an increase in \ncorporate debt exposures. Standardized Market \nRWAs as of December 2019 decreased by $       \n9.98billion compared with December 2018,      \nprimarily reflecting a decrease in specific   \nrisk, principally due to reduced exposures,   \nand a decrease in incremental risk,           \nprincipally due to reduced exposures and      \nchanges in risk measurements. Advanced Credit \nRWAs as of December 2019 decreased by $       \n7.67billion compared with December 2018.      \nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, the  \nfirm made changes to the calculation of the   \nloss given default for certain wholesale      \nexposures which resulted in a decrease in     \ncredit RWAs, primarily in commitments,        \nguarantees and loans and derivatives. This    \ndecrease was partially offset by an increase  \nin other credit RWAs, principally due to the  \nrecognition of operating lease right-of-      \nuseassets upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02and \nan increase in corporate debt exposures.      \nAdvanced Market RWAs as of December 2019      \ndecreased by $ 10.19billion compared with     \nDecember 2018, primarily reflecting a decrease\nin specific risk, principally due to reduced  \nexposures, and a decrease in incremental risk,\nprincipally due to reduced exposures and      \nchanges in risk measurements.

Bank Subsidiaries Regulatory     \nCapital Ratios. GS Bank USA, the firm\u2019s       \nprimary U.S. bank subsidiary, is an FDIC-     \ninsured, New York State-chartered bank and a  \nmember of the Federal Reserve System, is      \nsupervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC,\nthe New York State Department of Financial    \nServices and the Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau, and is subject to regulatory capital  \nrequirements that are calculated in           \nsubstantially the same manner as those        \napplicable to BHCs. For purposes of assessing \nthe adequacy of its capital, GS Bank USA      \ncalculates its risk-based capital and leverage\nratios in accordance with the regulatory      \ncapital requirements applicable to state      \nmember banks. Those requirements are based on \nthe Capital Framework described above. GS Bank\nUSA is an Advanced approach banking           \norganization under the Capital Framework.     \nSimilar to the firm, GS Bank USA is required  \nto calculate each of the CET1 capital, Tier 1 \ncapital and Total capital ratios in accordance\nwith both the Standardized and Advanced       \nCapital Rules. The lower of each risk-based   \ncapital ratio calculated in accordance with   \nthe Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules is\nthe ratio against which GS Bank USA\u2019s         \ncompliance with its risk-based capital        \nrequirements is assessed. In addition, under  \nthe regulatory framework for prompt corrective\naction applicable to GS Bank USA, in order to \nmeet the quantitative requirements for being a\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d depository institution, GS \nBank USA must also meet the \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nrequirements in the table below.

As a result\nof GS Bank USA\u2019s election to exclude holdings \nof U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at   \nthe Federal Reserve from its total leverage   \nexposure, any dividend by GS Bank USA during  \nthe period from July 1, 2020 through March 31,\n2021 is subject to the prior approval of the  \nFRB. Furthermore, the amount of dividends that\nmay be paid by GS Bank USA are limited to the \nlesser of the amounts calculated under a      \nrecent earnings test and an undivided profits \ntest. The FRB, the FDIC and the New York State\nDepartment of Financial Services have         \nauthority to prohibit or to limit the payment \nof dividends by the banking organizations they\nsupervise (including GS Bank USA) if, in the  \nregulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend    \nwould constitute an unsafe or unsound practice\nin light of the financial condition of the    \nbanking organization.

Group Inc.\u2019s equity investment \nin subsidiaries was $ 98.14billion as of June \n2020 and $ 95.68billion as of December 2019,  \nof which Group Inc. was required to maintain $\n61.54billion as of June 2020 and $            \n57.58billion as of December 2019, of minimum  \nequity capital in its regulated subsidiaries  \nin order to satisfy the regulatory            \nrequirements of such subsidiaries. Group      \nInc.\u2019s capital invested in certain            \nnon-U.S.subsidiaries is exposed to foreign    \nexchange risk, substantially all of which is  \nmanaged through a combination of derivatives  \nand non-U.S.denominated debt.

The final\nresolution of the\naudit for tax years\n2011 through 2016 is\nnot expected to have a\nmaterial impact on the\neffective tax rate.\nThe 2017 and 2018 tax\nyears remain subject\nto post-filing review.\n\nNew York State\nexaminations\n(excluding GS Bank\nUSA) of 2011 through\n2014 began in 2017.\nDuring the second\nquarter of 2020, New\nYork City\u2019s\nexamination of the tax\nyears 2011 through\n2014 was completed.\nThe resolution of this\nexamination did not\nhave a material impact\non the effective tax\nrate for the second\nquarter of 2020. New\nYork State and City\nexaminations for GS\nBank USA have been\ncompleted through\n2014.\n\nAll years, including\nand subsequent to the\nyears in the table\nabove, remain open to\nexamination by the\ntaxing authorities.\nThe firm believes that\nthe liability for\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits it has\nestablished is\nadequate in relation\nto the potential for\nadditional\nassessments.\nNote 25. Business Segments The firm reports   \nits activities in the following four business \nsegments: Investment Banking, Global Markets, \nAsset Management and Consumer & Wealth        \nManagement. See Note 1 for information about  \nthe firm\u2019s business segments. Compensation and\nbenefits expenses in the firm\u2019s segments      \nreflect, among other factors, the overall     \nperformance of the firm, as well as the       \nperformance of individual businesses.         \nConsequently, pre-taxmargins in one segment of\nthe firm\u2019s business may be significantly      \naffected by the performance of the firm\u2019s     \nother business segments. The firm allocates   \nassets (including allocations of global core  \nliquid assets and cash, secured client        \nfinancing and other assets), revenues and     \nexpenses among the four business segments. Due\nto the integrated nature of these segments,   \nestimates and judgments are made in allocating\ncertain assets, revenues and expenses. The    \nallocation process is based on the manner in  \nwhich management currently views the          \nperformance of the segments. The allocation of\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity and preferred     \nstock dividends to each segment is based on   \nthe estimated amount of equity required to    \nsupport the activities of the segment under   \nrelevant regulatory capital requirements. Net \nearnings for each segment is calculated by    \napplying the firmwide tax rate to each        \nsegment\u2019s pre-taxearnings. Management believes\nthat this allocation provides a reasonable    \nrepresentation of each segment\u2019s contribution \nto consolidated net earnings to common, return\non average common equity and total assets.    \nTransactions between segments are based on    \nspecific criteria or approximate third-party  \nrates.                                        \n                                           \n  83    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Legal Proceedings The firm is        \ninvolved in a number of judicial, regulatory  \nand arbitration proceedings (including those  \ndescribed below) concerning matters arising in\nconnection with the conduct of the firm\u2019s     \nbusinesses. Many of these proceedings are in  \nearly stages, and many of these cases seek an \nindeterminate amount of damages. Under ASC    \n450, an event is \u201creasonably possible\u201d if \u201cthe\nchance of the future event or events occurring\nis more than remote but less than likely\u201d and \nan event is \u201cremote\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the    \nfuture event or events occurring is slight.\u201d  \nThus, references to the upper end of the range\nof reasonably possible loss for cases in which\nthe firm is able to estimate a range of       \nreasonably possible loss mean the upper end of\nthe range of loss for cases for which the firm\nbelieves the risk of loss is more than slight.\nWith respect to matters described below for   \nwhich management has been able to estimate a  \nrange of reasonably possible loss where (i)   \nactual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an\namount of money damages, (ii) the firm is     \nbeing, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers\nin a securities offering and is not being     \nindemnified by a party that the firm believes \nwill pay the full amount of any judgment, or  \n(iii) the purchasers are demanding that the   \nfirm repurchase securities, management has    \nestimated the upper end of the range of       \nreasonably possible loss as being equal to (a)\nin the case of (i), the amount of money       \ndamages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the \ndifference between the initial sales price of \nthe securities that the firm sold in such     \noffering and the estimated lowest subsequent  \nprice of such securities prior to the action  \nbeing commenced and (c) in the case of (iii), \nthe price that purchasers paid for the        \nsecurities less the estimated value, if any,  \nas of June 2020 of the relevant securities, in\neach of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking into\naccount any other factors believed to be      \nrelevant to the particular matter or matters  \nof that type. As of the date hereof, the firm \nhas estimated the upper end of the range of   \nreasonably possible aggregate loss for such   \nmatters and for any other matters described   \nbelow where management has been able to       \nestimate a range of reasonably possible       \naggregate loss to be approximately $          \n0.9billion in excess of the aggregate reserves\nfor such matters.                             \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    86  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Management is generally unable to \nestimate a range of reasonably possible loss  \nfor matters other than those included in the  \nestimate above, including where (i) actual or \npotential plaintiffs have not claimed an      \namount of money damages, except in those      \ninstances where management can otherwise      \ndetermine an appropriate amount, (ii) matters \nare in early stages, (iii) matters relate to  \nregulatory investigations or reviews, except  \nin those instances where management can       \notherwise determine an appropriate amount,    \n(iv) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood\nof a class being certified or the ultimate    \nsize of the class, (v) there is uncertainty as\nto the outcome of pending appeals or motions, \n(vi) there are significant factual issues to  \nbe resolved, and/or (vii) there are novel     \nlegal issues presented. For example, the      \nfirm\u2019s potential liabilities with respect to  \nthe investigations and reviews described below\nin \u201cRegulatory Investigations and Reviews and \nRelated Litigation\u201d generally are not included\nin management\u2019s estimate of reasonably        \npossible loss. However, management does not   \nbelieve, based on currently available         \ninformation, that the outcomes of such other  \nmatters will have a material adverse effect on\nthe firm\u2019s financial condition, though the    \noutcomes could be material to the firm\u2019s      \noperating results for any particular period,  \ndepending, in part, upon the operating results\nfor such period. See Note 18 for further      \ninformation about mortgage-related            \ncontingencies. 1MDB-Related Matters The firm  \nhas received subpoenas and requests for       \ndocuments and information from various        \ngovernmental and regulatory bodies and self-  \nregulatory organizations as part of           \ninvestigations and reviews relating to        \nfinancing transactions and other matters      \ninvolving 1MDB. Subsidiaries of the firm acted\nas arrangers or purchasers of approximately $ \n6.5billion of debt securities of 1MDB. On     \nNovember 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of      \nJustice (DOJ) unsealed a criminal information \nand guilty plea by Tim Leissner, a former     \nparticipating managing director of the firm,  \nand an indictment against Ng Chong Hwa, a     \nformer managing director of the firm, and Low \nTaek Jho. Leissner pleaded guilty to a two-   \ncountcriminal information charging him with   \nconspiring to launder money and conspiring to \nviolate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices    \nAct\u2019s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal        \naccounting controls provisions. Low and Ng    \nwere charged in a three-count indictment with \nconspiring to launder money and conspiring to \nviolate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery provisions. On\nAugust 28, 2018, Leissner\u2019s guilty plea was   \naccepted by the U.S. District Court for the   \nEastern District of New York and Leissner was \nadjudicated guilty on both counts. Ng was also\ncharged in this indictment with conspiring to \nviolate the FCPA\u2019s internal accounting        \ncontrols provisions. The charging documents   \nstate, among other things, that Leissner and  \nNg participated in a conspiracy to            \nmisappropriate proceeds of the 1MDB offerings \nfor themselves and to pay bribes to various   \ngovernment officials to obtain and retain 1MDB\nbusiness for the firm. The plea and charging  \ndocuments indicate that Leissner and Ng       \nknowingly and willfully circumvented the      \nfirm\u2019s system of internal accounting controls,\nin part by repeatedly lying to control        \npersonnel and internal committees that        \nreviewed these offerings. The indictment of Ng\nand Low alleges that the firm\u2019s system of     \ninternal accounting controls could be easily  \ncircumvented and that the firm\u2019s business     \nculture, particularly in Southeast Asia, at   \ntimes prioritized consummation of deals ahead \nof the proper operation of its compliance     \nfunctions. On May 6, 2019, Ng pleaded not     \nguilty to the DOJ\u2019s criminal charges. On      \nFebruary 4, 2020, the FRB disclosed that      \nAndrea Vella, a former participating managing \ndirector whom the DOJ had previously referred \nto as an unindicted co-conspirator,had agreed,\nwithout admitting or denying the FRB\u2019s        \nallegations, to a consent order that          \nprohibited him from participating in the      \nbanking industry. No other penalties were     \nimposed by the consent order.                 \n                                           \n  87    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) On December 17, 2018, the Attorney\nGeneral of Malaysia filed criminal charges in \nMalaysia against GSI, as the arranger of three\nofferings of debt securities of 1MDB,         \naggregating approximately $ 6.5billion in     \nprincipal amount, for alleged disclosure      \ndeficiencies in the offering documents        \nrelating to, among other things, the use of   \nproceeds for the debt securities, as well as  \nagainst Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC (GS Asia) and\nGoldman Sachs (Singapore) PTE (GS Singapore). \nCriminal charges have also been filed against \nLeissner, Low, Ng and Jasmine Loo Ai Swan. In \na related press release, the Attorney General \nof Malaysia indicated that prosecutors in     \nMalaysia will seek criminal fines against the \naccused in excess of $ 2.7billion plus the $  \n600million of fees received in connection with\nthe debt offerings. On August 9, 2019, the    \nAttorney General of Malaysia announced that   \ncriminal charges had also been filed against  \nseventeen current and former directors of GSI,\nGS Asia and GS Singapore (together with the   \ncriminal charges against GSI, GS Asia and GS  \nSingapore, the Malaysian Criminal             \nProceedings). The Malaysia Securities         \nCommission (MSC) issued notices to show cause \nagainst Goldman Sachs (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (GS  \nMalaysia) in December 2018 and March 2019 that\n(i) allege possible violations of Malaysian   \nsecurities laws and (ii) indicate that the    \nMSCis considering whether to revoke GS        \nMalaysia\u2019s license to conduct corporate       \nfinance and fund management activities in     \nMalaysia. On July 24, 2020, the firm announced\nthat it has reached an agreement in principle,\nsubject to the executionof definitive         \ndocumentation, with the Government of Malaysia\nto resolve all the criminal and regulatory    \nproceedings in Malaysia involving the firm,   \nincluding the Malaysian Criminal Proceedings  \nand the MSC\u2019s notices to show cause. The      \nagreement in principle would involve the      \npayment to the Government of Malaysia of $    \n2.5billion and a guarantee that the Government\nof Malaysia receives at least $ 1.4billion in \nassets andproceeds from assets seized by      \ngovernmental authorities around the world     \nrelated to 1MDB . In addition, the Government \nof Malaysia agreed to withdraw the Malaysian  \nCriminal Proceedings and agreed that no       \nfurther charges would be brought against Group\nInc., its affiliates and subsidiaries, or any \nof their directors and officers (excluding    \nLeissner and Ng) related to 1MDB. The firm has\nreceived multiple demands, beginning in       \nNovember 2018, from alleged shareholders under\nSection 220 of the Delaware General           \nCorporation Law for books and records relating\nto, among other things, the firm\u2019s involvement\nwith 1MDB and the firm\u2019s compliance           \nprocedures. On December 13, 2019, an alleged  \nshareholder filed a lawsuit in the Court of   \nChancery of the State of Delaware seeking     \nbooks and records relating to, among other    \nthings, the firm\u2019s involvement with 1MDB and  \nthe firm\u2019s compliance procedures. The parties \nhave agreed to stay proceedings pending       \nresolution of the books and records demand. On\nFebruary 19, 2019, a purported shareholder    \nderivative action relating to 1MDB was filed  \nin the U.S. District Court for the Southern   \nDistrict of New York against Group Inc. and   \nthe directors at the time and a former        \nchairman and chief executive officer of the   \nfirm. The amended complaint filed on July 12, \n2019, which seeks unspecified damages,        \ndisgorgement and injunctive relief, alleges   \nbreaches of fiduciary duties, including in    \nconnection with alleged insider trading by    \ncertain current and former directors, unjust  \nenrichment and violations of the anti-fraud   \nprovisions of the Exchange Act, including in  \nconnection with Group Inc.\u2019s common stock     \nrepurchases and solicitation of proxies.      \nDefendants moved to dismiss this action on    \nSeptember 12, 2019. Beginning in March 2019,  \nthe firm has also received demands from       \nalleged shareholders to investigate and pursue\nclaims against certain current and former     \ndirectors and executive officers based on     \ntheir oversight and public disclosures        \nregarding 1MDB and related internal controls. \nOn November 21, 2018, a summons with notice   \nwas filed in New York Supreme Court, County of\nNew York, by International Petroleum          \nInvestment Company, which guaranteed certain  \ndebt securities issued by 1MDB, and its       \nsubsidiary Aabar Investments PJS.

These discussions, which are     \nbeing principally led by the DOJ, are         \nprogressing. There can be no assurance that   \nthe discussions will lead to resolution of any\nof those matters. Any such resolution, as well\nas proceedings by the DOJ or other            \ngovernmental or regulatory authorities, could \nresult in the imposition of significant fines,\npenalties and other sanctions against the     \nfirm, including restrictions on the firm\u2019s    \nactivities. Mortgage-Related Matters Beginning\nin April 2010, a number of purported          \nsecurities law class actions were filed in the\nU.S. District Court for the Southern District \nof New York challenging the adequacy of Group \nInc.\u2019s public disclosure of, among other      \nthings, the firm\u2019s activities in the          \ncollateralized debt obligation market, and the\nfirm\u2019s conflict of interest management. The   \nconsolidated amended complaint filed on July  \n25, 2011, which names as defendants Group Inc.\nand certain current and former officers and   \nemployees of Group Inc. and its affiliates,   \ngenerally alleges violations of Sections 10(b)\nand 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seeks       \nunspecified damages. The defendants have moved\nfor summary judgment. On April 7, 2020, the   \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the  \ndistrict court\u2019s August 14, 2018 grant of     \nclass certification, and on June 15, 2020, the\nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals denied        \ndefendants\u2019 motion seeking rehearing of the   \nApril 7, 2020 decision. On July 16, 2020, the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals granted       \ndefendants\u2019 motion to stay the proceedings in \nthe litigation, pending the resolution of a   \npetition for writ of certiorari to the United \nStates Supreme Court to seek review of the    \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 April 7, 2020\ndecision.

The firm continues to receive   \nrequests for information, including from      \ncertain regulators, relating to mortgage-     \nrelated activities. Director Compensation-    \nRelated Litigation On May 9, 2017, Group Inc. \nand certain of its current and former         \ndirectors were named as defendants in a       \npurported direct and derivative shareholder   \naction in the Court of Chancery of the State  \nof Delaware (a similar purported derivative   \naction, filed in June 2015, alleging excessive\ndirector compensation over the period 2012 to \n2014 was voluntarily dismissed without        \nprejudice in December 2016). The complaint    \nalleges that excessive compensation has been  \npaid to the non-employeedirector defendants   \nsince 2015, and that certain disclosures in   \nconnection with soliciting shareholder        \napproval of the stock incentive plans were    \ndeficient. The complaint asserts claims for   \nbreaches of fiduciary duties and seeks, among \nother things, rescission or in some cases     \nrescissory damages, disgorgement, and         \nshareholder votes on several matters. On      \nOctober 23, 2018, the court declined to       \napprove the parties\u2019 proposed settlement. On  \nMay 31, 2019, the court dismissed the         \ndisclosure-related claims, but permitted the  \nnon-employeedirector compensation claim to    \nproceed. The parties have filed a proposed    \nsettlement with the Delaware court, which is  \nsubject to court approval. As part of the     \nproposed settlement, the firm has agreed to   \ncertain changes to its Non-EmployeeDirector   \nCompensation Program. On June 19, 2020, a     \nGroup Inc. shareholder filed an objection to  \nthe proposed settlement. Currencies-Related   \nLitigation GS&Co. and Group Inc. are among the\ndefendants named in putative class actions    \nfiled in the U.S. District Court for the      \nSouthern District of New York beginning in    \nSeptember 2016 on behalf of putative indirect \npurchasers of foreign exchange instruments. On\nAugust 5, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a third  \nconsolidated amended complaint generally      \nalleging a conspiracy to manipulate the       \nforeign currency exchange markets, asserting  \nclaims under various state antitrust laws and \nstate consumer protection laws and seeking    \ntreble damages in an unspecified amount. On   \nJuly 17, 2020, the court preliminarily        \napproved a settlement in principle. The firm  \nhas reserved the full amount of its proposed  \ncontribution to the settlement.

Based on our reviews, \nwe are not aware of any material modifications\nthat should be made to the accompanying       \ninterim financial statements for them to be in\nconformity with accounting principles         \ngenerally accepted in the United States of    \nAmerica. We have previously audited, in       \naccordance with the standards of the Public   \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United    \nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance     \nsheet of the Company as of December 31, 2019, \nand the related consolidated statements of    \nearnings, comprehensive income, changes in    \nshareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for the   \nyear then ended (not presented herein), and in\nour report dated February 20, 2020, we        \nexpressed an unqualified opinion on those     \nconsolidated financial statements. In our     \nopinion, the information set forth in the     \naccompanying consolidated balance sheet as of \nDecember 31, 2019 is fairly stated in all     \nmaterial respects in relation to the          \nconsolidated balance sheet from which it has  \nbeen derived. Basis for Review Results These  \ninterim financial statements are the          \nresponsibility of the Company\u2019s management. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with  \nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent  \nwith respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the      \napplicable rules and regulations of the       \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the    \nPCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance  \nwith the standards of the PCAOB. A review of  \ninterim financial information consists        \nprincipally of applying analytical procedures \nand making inquiries of persons responsible   \nfor financial and accounting matters. It is   \nsubstantially less in scope than an audit     \nconducted in accordance with the standards of \nthe PCAOB, the objective of which is the      \nexpression of an opinion regarding the        \nfinancial statements taken as a whole.        \nAccordingly, we do not express such an        \nopinion. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New   \nYork, New York August 6, 2020                 \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q    96  \n                                           \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Beginning in the fourth quarter of \n2019, we changed our business segments and    \nbalance sheet presentation to better reflect  \nthe nature of our activities.                 \nReclassifications have been made to previously\nreported amounts to conform to the current    \npresentation. See Note 2 to the consolidated  \nfinancial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the\n2019 Form 10-Kfor further information.        \nExecutive Overview Three Months Ended June    \n2020 versus June 2019. We generated net       \nearnings of $373 million for the second       \nquarter of 2020, a decrease of 85% compared   \nwith $2.42 billion for the second quarter of  \n2019. Diluted earnings per common share was   \n$0.53 for the second quarter of 2020, a       \ndecrease of 91% compared with $5.81 for the   \nsecond quarter of 2019. Annualized return on  \naverage common shareholders\u2019 equity (ROE) was \n1.0% for the second quarter of 2020, compared \nwith 11.1% for the second quarter of 2019.    \nBook value per common share was $221.55 as of \nJune 2020, 3.5% higher compared with June     \n2019. During the second quarter of 2020, we   \nrecorded net provisions for litigation and    \nregulatory proceedings of $2.96 billion, which\nreduced diluted earnings per common share by  \n$8.23 and annualized ROE by 14.5 percentage   \npoints. Net revenues were $13.30 billion for  \nthe second quarter of 2020, 41% higher than   \nthe second quarter of 2019. Net revenues in   \nGlobal Markets were significantly higher,     \nacross both Fixed Income, Currency and        \nCommodities (FICC), reflecting strong client  \nactivity in intermediation and financing, and \nEquities, reflecting strong performance in    \nintermediation. Net revenues in Investment    \nBanking were significantly higher, driven by  \nsignificantly higher net revenues in both     \nEquity and Debt underwriting. Additionally,   \nnet revenues in Consumer & Wealth Management  \nwere higher. These increases were partially   \noffset by lower net revenues in Asset         \nManagement, due to significantly lower net    \ngains from investments in private equities.   \nProvision for credit losses was $1.59 billion \nfor the second quarter of 2020, compared with \n$214 million for the second quarter of 2019.  \nThis increase was primarily due to            \nsignificantly higher provisions related to    \nwholesale loans and, to a lesser extent,      \nconsumer loans, reflecting revisions to       \nforecasts of expected deterioration in the    \nbroader economic environment (incorporating   \nthe accounting for credit losses under the    \nCurrent Expected Credit Losses (CECL)         \nstandard). In addition, the increase in       \nprovisions related to wholesale loans         \nreflected the impact of individual impairments\nduring the quarter. The second quarter of 2020\nalso included provisions related to credit    \ncard loans.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nexpenses were $10.41 billion for the second   \nquarter of 2020, 70% higher than the second   \nquarter of 2019, primarily due to             \nsignificantly higher net provisions for       \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings and     \nsignificantly higher compensation and benefits\nexpenses (reflecting significantly higher net \nrevenues). In addition, brokerage, clearing,  \nexchange and distribution fees were higher    \n(reflecting an increase in activity levels)   \nand expenses related to consolidated          \ninvestments, including impairments, were      \nhigher. Our efficiency ratio (total operating \nexpenses divided by total net revenues) for   \nthe second quarter of 2020 was 78.3%, compared\nwith 64.7% for the second quarter of 2019. Net\nprovisions for litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings increased our efficiency ratio for\nthe second quarter of 2020 by 22.2 percentage \npoints. During the second quarter of 2020, we \nreturned $450 million of capital in common    \nstock dividends. As of June 2020, our Common  \nEquity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio as         \ncalculated in accordance with the Standardized\nCapital Rules was 13.3% and as calculated in  \naccordance with the Advanced Capital Rules was\n11.9%. We continue to manage our capital,     \nwhile deploying balance sheet for our clients,\nin anticipation of our Standardized CET1      \ncapital ratio requirement of 13.7% reflecting \nour stress capital buffer (SCB) beginning     \nOctober 1, 2020. See Note 20 to the           \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about our capital ratios. Six     \nMonths Ended June 2020 versus June 2019. We   \ngenerated net earnings of $1.59 billion for   \nthe first half of 2020, a decrease of 66%     \ncompared with $4.67 billion for the first half\nof 2019. Diluted earnings per common share was\n$3.66 for the first half of 2020, a decrease  \nof 68% compared with $11.52 for the first half\nof 2019. Annualized ROE was 3.3% for the first\nhalf of 2020, compared with 11.1% for the     \nfirst half of 2019. During the first half of  \n2020, we recorded net provisions for          \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings of $3.14\nbillion, which reduced diluted earnings per   \ncommon share by $8.76 and annualized ROE by   \n7.8 percentage points. Net revenues were      \n$22.04 billion for the first half of 2020, 21%\nhigher than the first half of 2019. Net       \nrevenues were significantly higher in both    \nFICC and Equities within Global Markets,      \ndriven by strong client activity, and in      \nInvestment Banking, reflecting significantly  \nhigher net revenues in both Equity and Debt   \nunderwriting. Net revenues in Consumer &      \nWealth Management were higher, reflecting     \nstrength in both Consumer banking and Wealth  \nmanagement. These increases were partially    \noffset by significantly lower net revenues in \nAsset Management due to significantly lower   \nnet revenues in Equity investments and a net  \nloss in Lending and debt investments for the  \nfirst half of 2020. Provision for credit      \nlosses was $2.53 billion for the first half of\n2020, compared with $438 million for the first\nhalf of 2019. This increase was primarily due \nto significantly higher provisions related to \nwholesale loans and, to a lesser extent,      \nconsumer loans as a result of forecasts of    \nexpected deterioration in the broader economic\nenvironment (incorporating the accounting for \ncredit losses under the CECL standard) related\nto the impact of the global outbreak of the   \ncoronavirus (COVID-19)pandemic during the     \nfirst half of 2020. In addition, the increase \nin provisions related to wholesale loans      \nreflected the impact of individual impairments\nand downgrades during the first half of 2020  \n.The first half of 2020 also included         \nprovisions related to credit card loans.      \nOperating expenses were $16.87 billion for the\nfirst half of 2020, 41% higher than the first \nhalf of 2019, primarily due to significantly  \nhigher net provisions for litigation and      \nregulatory proceedings and higher compensation\nand benefits expenses (reflecting             \nsignificantly higher net revenues). In        \naddition, brokerage, clearing, exchange and   \ndistribution fees were significantly higher   \n(reflecting an increase in activity levels)   \nand expenses related to consolidated          \ninvestments, including impairments, were also \nsignificantly higher. Our efficiency ratio    \n(total operating expenses divided by total net\nrevenues) for the first half of 2020 was      \n76.6%, compared with 65.6% for the first half \nof 2019. Net provisions for litigation and    \nregulatory proceedings increased our          \nefficiency ratio for the first half of 2020 by\n14.3 percentage points. During the first half \nof 2020, we returned $2.83 billion of capital \nto common shareholders, including $1.93       \nbillion of common share repurchases and $899  \nmillion in common stock dividends. Business   \nEnvironment The second quarter of 2020 was    \ncharacterized by continued uncertainty as the \nCOVID-19pandemic persisted across the globe,  \nresulting in a further contraction in global  \neconomic activity, high unemployment, and     \nelevated market volatility. However, as the   \nquarter progressed, many economies began to   \ntake steps towards reopening, causing economic\nindicators to improve. As a result, financial \nmarkets rebounded during the quarter as equity\nprices increased and credit spreads tightened \ndue to improved sentiment towards economic    \nrecovery. This rise in the valuation of risk  \nassets was also fueled by continued support   \nfrom governments and central banks globally.  \nGovernments continued to provide fiscal       \nstimulus to individuals and businesses,       \nincluding under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,  \nand Economic Security (CARES) Act in the U.S.,\nwhile central banks around the world continued\nto intervene with widespread monetary easing  \nmeasures to support market liquidity and the  \navailability of credit.                       \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    100  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Use of   \nEstimates U.S. GAAP requires us to make       \ncertain estimates and assumptions. In addition\nto the estimates we make in connection with   \nfair value measurements and the allowance for \ncredit losses on loans and lending commitments\nheld for investment and accounted for at      \namortized cost, the use of estimates and      \nassumptions is also important in determining  \ndiscretionary compensation accruals, the      \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and provisions for losses    \nthat may arise from tax audits. A substantial \nportion of our compensation and benefits      \nrepresents discretionary compensation, which  \nis finalized at year-end.We believe the most  \nappropriate way to allocate estimated year-   \nenddiscretionary compensation among interim   \nperiods is in proportion to the net revenues  \nearned in such periods. In addition to the    \nlevel of net revenues, our overall            \ncompensation expense in any given year is also\ninfluenced by, among other factors, overall   \nfinancial performance, prevailing labor       \nmarkets, business mix, the structure of our   \nshare-based compensation programs and the     \nexternal environment. Goodwill is assessed for\nimpairment annually in the fourth quarter or  \nmore frequently if events occur or            \ncircumstances change that indicate an         \nimpairment may exist. When assessing goodwill \nfor impairment, first, a qualitative          \nassessment can be made to determine whether it\nis more likely than not that the estimated    \nfair value of a reporting unit is less than   \nits estimated carrying value. If the results  \nof the qualitative assessment are not         \nconclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is   \nperformed. Alternatively, a quantitative      \ngoodwill test can be performed without        \nperforming a qualitative assessment.          \nEstimating the fair value of our reporting    \nunits requires judgment. Critical inputs to   \nthe fair value estimates include projected    \nearnings and allocated equity. There is       \ninherent uncertainty in the projected         \nearnings. The estimated carrying value of each\nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and represents the       \nestimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity\nrequired to support the activities of the     \nreporting unit under currently applicable     \nregulatory capital requirements. See Note 12  \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about goodwill. If we     \nexperience a prolonged or severe period of    \nweakness in the business environment,         \nfinancial markets, our performance or our     \ncommon stock price, or additional increases in\ncapital requirements, our goodwill could be   \nimpaired in the future. Identifiable          \nintangible assets are tested for impairment   \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances   \nsuggest that an asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s      \ncarrying value may not be fully recoverable.  \nJudgment is required to evaluate whether      \nindications of potential impairment have      \noccurred, and to test intangible assets for   \nimpairment, if required. An impairment is     \nrecognized if the total of the estimated      \nundiscounted cash flows relating to the asset \nor asset group is less than the corresponding \ncarrying value. See Note 12 to the            \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about identifiable intangible     \nassets. We also estimate and provide for      \npotential losses that may arise out of        \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings to the  \nextent that such losses are probable and can  \nbe reasonably estimated. In addition, we      \nestimate the upper end of the range of        \nreasonably possible aggregate loss in excess  \nof the related reserves for litigation and    \nregulatory proceedings where we believe the   \nrisk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18\nand 27 to the consolidated financial          \nstatements for information about certain      \njudicial, litigation and regulatory           \nproceedings. Significant judgment is required \nin making these estimates and our final       \nliabilities may ultimately be materially      \ndifferent. Our total estimated liability in   \nrespect of litigation and regulatory          \nproceedings is determined on a case-by-       \ncasebasis and represents an estimate of       \nprobable losses after considering, among other\nfactors, the progress of each case, proceeding\nor investigation, our experience and the      \nexperience of others in similar cases,        \nproceedings or investigations, and the        \nopinions and views of legal counsel. In       \naccounting for income taxes, we recognize tax \npositions in the financial statements only    \nwhen it is more likely than not that the      \nposition will be sustained on examination by  \nthe relevant taxing authority based on the    \ntechnical merits of the position. See Note 24 \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about income taxes.

Results of Operations The       \ncomposition of our net revenues has varied    \nover time as financial markets and the scope  \nof our operations have changed.

Tangible common            \n       shareholders\u2019 equity and ROTE          \n       arenon-GAAPmeasures and may not be     \n       comparable to similarnon-GAAPmeasures  \n       used by other companies. Annualized    \n       return on average total shareholders\u2019  \n       equity is calculated by dividing       \n       annualized net earnings by average     \n       monthly total shareholders\u2019 equity.    \n                                              \n                                              \n  The table below presents our average        \n  equity and                                  \n  the reconciliation of average common        \n  shareholders\u2019                               \n  equity to average tangible common           \n  shareholders\u2019                               \n  equity.                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n        Av\u2026                                   \n        for                                   \n        the                                   \n        Th\u2026                 Six               \n        Mo\u2026                 Mo\u2026               \n        En\u2026                 En\u2026               \n        Ju\u2026                 Ju\u2026               \n  $                                           \n  in    20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026     \n  m\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026      $         $         $         $     \n  s\u2026    91\u2026       90\u2026       90\u2026       89\u2026     \n  e\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )    (1\u2026  )  \n  s\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  s\u2026    80\u2026       79\u2026       79\u2026       78\u2026     \n  e\u2026                                          \n  G\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026    (4\u2026  )    (4\u2026  )    (4\u2026  )    (4\u2026  )  \n  i\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026      $         $         $         $     \n  s\u2026    75\u2026       74\u2026       74\u2026       74\u2026     \n  e\u2026                                          \n                                              \nNet Revenues The table                        \nbelow presents our net                        \nrevenues by line item.                        \n                                              \n          Three                Six            \n          Mont\u2026              Mont\u2026            \n          Ended              Ended            \n           June               June            \n  $ in     2020      2019     2020      2019  \n  mil\u2026                                        \n  Inv\u2026        $         $        $         $  \n  ban\u2026    2,733     1,761    4,475     3,379  \n  Inv\u2026    1,635     1,520    3,403     2,956  \n  man\u2026                                        \n  Com\u2026                                        \n  and       875       808    1,895     1,553  \n  fees                                        \n  Mar\u2026    5,787     2,479    9,469     5,202  \n  mak\u2026                                        \n  Oth\u2026                                        \n  pri\u2026    1,321     1,822      539     2,889  \n  tra\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  non\u2026    12,3\u2026     8,390    19,7\u2026    15,979  \n  rev\u2026                                        \n  Int\u2026    3,034     5,760    7,784    11,357  \n  inc\u2026                                        \n  Int\u2026    2,090     4,689    5,527     9,068  \n  exp\u2026                                        \n  Net                                         \n  int\u2026      944     1,071    2,257     2,289  \n  inc\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026        $         $        $         $  \n  net     13,2\u2026     9,461    22,0\u2026    18,268  \n  rev\u2026                                        \n                                              \nIn the table above:                           \n                                              \n       Investment banking consists of         \n       revenues (excluding net interest)      \n  \u2022    from financial advisory and            \n       underwriting assignments.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nEnvironment. The second quarter of 2020       \ncontinued to be impacted by the               \nCOVID-19pandemic, resulting in a deceleration \nin global economic activity and elevated      \nmarket volatility. Economic indicators        \ngenerally improved as the quarter progressed, \nfollowing significant declines in March and   \nApril, as economies began to reopen and       \ncentral banks, along with governments,        \ncontinued to implement monetary easing        \nmeasures and provide fiscal stimulus to       \nsupport economic activity. These factors, in  \nconjunction with improved sentiment for a     \nnear-term economic recovery, contributed to   \nhigher global equity prices, while credit     \nspreads tightened due to an improved outlook  \non corporate liquidity and solvency. Market-  \nmaking activities operated in an environment  \ncharacterized by strong client activity, as   \nclients actively repositioned investment      \nportfolios and hedged risks across asset      \nclasses. Investment banking activities        \nbenefitted from strong industry-wide equity   \nand debt underwriting activity, as issuers    \naccessed the market to benefit from the lower \nrate environment and to address liquidity     \nneeds, while industry-wide mergers and        \nacquisitions activity decreased, reflecting   \nthe uncertainty caused by the COVID-19pandemic\non corporate strategy and CEO confidence. If  \nthe COVID-19pandemic persists, it may lead to \na decline in market-making activity levels, a \ncontinued decline in mergers and acquisitions \ntransactions, or a decline in industry-wide   \nequity or debt underwriting activity, and     \ndeclines in global equity markets or widening \nof credit spreads. As a result, net revenues  \nand the provision for credit losses would     \nlikely be negatively impacted. See \u201cSegment   \nOperating Results\u201d for information about the  \noperating environment and material trends and \nuncertainties that may impact our results of  \noperations. Three Months Ended June 2020      \nversus June 2019 Net revenues in the          \nconsolidated statements of earnings were      \n$13.30 billion for the second quarter of 2020,\n41% higher than the second quarter of 2019,   \nprimarily reflecting significantly higher     \nmarket marking and investment banking revenues\nand higher investment management revenues,    \npartially offset by significantly lower other \nprincipal transactions revenues and lower net \ninterest income. Non-InterestRevenues.        \nInvestment banking revenues in the            \nconsolidated statements of earnings were $2.73\nbillion for the second quarter of 2020, 55%   \nhigher than the second quarter of 2019, due to\nsignificantly higher revenues in both equity  \nand debt underwriting, reflecting a           \nsignificant increase in industry-wide volumes.\nThis increase was partially offset by lower   \nrevenues in financial advisory, reflecting a  \ndecrease in industry-wide completed mergers   \nand acquisitions transactions. Investment     \nmanagement revenues in the consolidated       \nstatements of earnings were $1.64 billion for \nthe second quarter of 2020, 8% higher than the\nsecond quarter of 2019, due to higher         \nmanagement and other fees, reflecting the     \nimpact of higher average assets under         \nsupervision and the impact of the             \nconsolidation of GS Personal Financial        \nManagement, partially offset by a lower       \naverage effective fee due to shifts in the mix\nof client assets and strategies. Commissions  \nand fees in the consolidated statements of    \nearnings were $875 million for the second     \nquarter of 2020, 8% higher than the second    \nquarter of 2019, reflecting an increase in our\nlisted cash equity volumes, generally         \nconsistent with market volumes. Market making \nrevenues in the consolidated statements of    \nearnings were $5.79 billion for the second    \nquarter of 2020, 133% higher than the second  \nquarter of 2019, primarily due to             \nsignificantly higher revenues in equity       \nproducts (both cash products and derivatives),\ncredit products, interest rate products,      \ncommodities and currencies. Other principal   \ntransactions revenues in the consolidated     \nstatements of earnings were $1.32 billion for \nthe second quarter of 2020, 27% lower than the\nsecond quarter of 2019, reflecting            \nsignificantly lower net gains from investments\nin private equities and a net loss related to \nrelationship lending activities, reflecting   \nthe impact of changes in credit spreads on    \nhedges. These decreases were partially offset \nby significantly higher net gains from        \ninvestments in public equities and debt       \ninvestments. Net Interest Income. Net interest\nincome in the consolidated statements of      \nearnings was $944 million for the second      \nquarter of 2020, 12% lower than the second    \nquarter of 2019, reflecting a decrease in     \ninterest income primarily related to          \ncollateralized agreements, other interest-    \nearning assets, and deposits with banks, each \nreflecting the impact of lower interest rates.\nThe decrease in interest income is partially  \noffset by a decrease in interest expense      \nprimarily related to other interest-bearing   \nliabilities, collateralized financings, long- \nterm borrowings and deposits, each reflecting \nthe impact of lower interest rates. The       \ndecrease in interest expense as a result of   \nlower interest rates was partially offset by  \nthe impact of higher average balances for     \ndeposits. See \u201cStatistical Disclosures \u2014      \nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities and       \nShareholders\u2019 Equity\u201d for further information \nabout our sources of net interest income.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nEnvironment. During the second quarter of     \n2020, the operating environment for Investment\nBanking reflected strong activity in          \nunderwriting, as issuers accessed the market  \nto benefit from the lower rate environment and\nto address liquidity needs caused by the      \nCOVID-19pandemic. Industry-wide equity        \nunderwriting volumes increased significantly, \ndriven by common stock and convertible        \nofferings, and industry-wide debt underwriting\nvolumes increased, particularly in investment-\ngrade and high yield activity, all compared   \nwith the first quarter of 2020. Corporate     \nclients began to pay down funds borrowed      \nduring the first quarter of 2020 under        \nrevolving lines of credit, reflecting         \nimproving economic conditions and companies\u2019  \nability to access securities markets, while   \ncorporate credit spreads tightened during the \nquarter. A decrease in industry-wide announced\nand completed mergers and acquisitions        \ntransactions compared with the first quarter  \nof 2020 reflected the uncertainty caused by   \nthe COVID-19pandemic on corporate strategy and\nCEO confidence. In the future, if industry-   \nwide mergers and acquisitions transactions    \ncontinue to decline, or if industry-wide      \nequity and debt underwriting volumes decline, \nor credit spreads related to hedges on our    \nrelationship lending portfolio continue to    \ntighten, net revenues in Investment Banking   \nwould likely be negatively impacted. In       \naddition, a deterioration in the              \ncreditworthiness of borrowers would negatively\nimpact the provision for credit losses. Three \nMonths Ended June 2020 versus June 2019. Net  \nrevenues in Investment Banking were $2.66     \nbillion for the second quarter of 2020, 36%   \nhigher than the second quarter of 2019,       \nreflecting significantly higher net revenues  \nin Underwriting, partially offset by a net    \nloss in Corporate lending and lower net       \nrevenues in Financial advisory. The increase  \nin Underwriting net revenues was due to       \nsignificantly higher net revenues in both     \nEquity and Debt underwriting, reflecting a    \nsignificant increase in industry-wide volumes.\nThe net loss in Corporate lending reflected   \nthe impact of changes in credit spreads on    \nhedges related to relationship lending        \nactivities. The second quarter of 2020        \nincluded $200 million of net losses related to\nthese hedges. The decrease in Financial       \nadvisory net revenues reflected a decrease in \nindustry-wide completed mergers and           \nacquisitions transactions. Provision for      \ncredit losses was $819 million for the second \nquarter of 2020, compared with $81 million for\nthe second quarter of 2019. This increase     \nreflected updated economic forecasts          \n(incorporating the accounting for credit      \nlosses under the CECL standard) and higher    \nimpairments related to relationship and       \nmiddle-market lending. See Note 3 to the      \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about ASU No. 2016-13. Operating  \nexpenses were $2.70 billion for the second    \nquarter of 2020, compared with $1.05 billion  \nfor the second quarter of 2019. This increase \nreflected significantly higher net provisions \nfor litigation and regulatory proceedings and \ncompensation and benefits expenses (reflecting\nsignificantly higher net revenues). Pre-      \ntaxloss was $866 million for the second       \nquarter of 2020, compared with pre-taxearnings\nof $817 million for the second quarter of     \n2019. Net provisions for litigation and       \nregulatory proceedings reduced annualized ROE \nby 38.5 percentage points for the second      \nquarter of 2020. As of June 2020, our         \ninvestment banking transaction backlog        \ndecreased significantly compared with March   \n2020, due to significantly lower estimated net\nrevenues across potential advisory            \ntransactions, potential debt underwriting     \ntransactions, particularly from leveraged     \nfinance and investment-grade transactions, and\npotential equity underwriting transactions,   \nprimarily from follow-onand convertible       \nofferings. These decreases reflected a lower  \nrate of replenishment of new deals compared   \nwith the completion of deals during the second\nquarter of 2020. Our backlog represents an    \nestimate of our net revenues from future      \ntransactionswhere we believe that future      \nrevenue realization is more likely than not.  \nWe believe changes in our backlog may be a    \nuseful indicator of client activity levels    \nwhich, over the long term, impact our net     \nrevenues. However, the time frame for         \ncompletion and corresponding revenue          \nrecognition of transactions in our backlog    \nvaries based on the nature of the assignment, \nas certain transactions may remain in our     \nbacklog for longer periods of time, which we  \nexpect to occur in light of the impact of the \nCOVID-19pandemic on mergers and acquisitions. \nIn addition, our backlog is subject to certain\nlimitations, such as assumptions about the    \nlikelihood that individual client transactions\nwill occur in the future. Transactions may be \ncancelled or modified, and transactions not   \nincluded in the estimate may also occur,      \nincluding underwriting transactions for which \nthe time frame from discussion to completion  \nhas shortened in the current environment. Six \nMonths Ended June 2020 versus June 2019. Net  \nrevenues in Investment Banking were $4.84     \nbillion for the first half of 2020, 31% higher\nthan the first half of 2019, primarily due to \nsignificantly higher net revenues in          \nUnderwriting and higher net revenues in       \nCorporate lending. These increases were       \npartially offset by lower net revenues in     \nFinancial advisory. The increase in           \nUnderwriting net revenues was due to          \nsignificantly higher net revenues in both     \nEquity and Debt underwriting, reflecting a    \nsignificant increase in industry-wide volumes.\nThe increase in Corporate lending net revenues\nwas due to higher net revenues related to     \nrelationship lending activities (reflecting   \nthe impact of changes in credit spreads on    \nhedges, as the first half of 2020 included    \napproximately $175 million of net gains,      \npartially offset by increased funding costs), \npartially offset by mark-downs on corporate   \nloans.

As part of                           \ncapital planning, we                          \nproject sources and                           \nuses of capital given                         \na range of business                           \nenvironments,                                 \nincluding stressed                            \nconditions.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Our      \ncapital planning process incorporates an      \ninternal capital adequacy assessment with the \nobjective of ensuring that we are             \nappropriately capitalized relative to the     \nrisks in our businesses. We incorporate stress\nscenarios into our capital planning process   \nwith a goal of holding sufficient capital to  \nensure we remain adequately capitalized after \nexperiencing a severe stress event. Our       \nassessment of capital adequacy is viewed in   \ntandem with our assessment of liquidity       \nadequacy and is integrated into our overall   \nrisk management structure, governance and     \npolicy framework. Our stress tests incorporate\nour internally designed stress scenarios,     \nincluding our internally developed severely   \nadverse scenario, and those required under    \nCCAR and DFAST, and are designed to capture   \nour specific vulnerabilities and risks. We    \nprovide further information about our stress  \ntest processes and a summary of the results on\nour website as described in \u201cAvailable        \nInformation.\u201d As required by the FRB\u2019s CCAR   \nrules, we submit an annual capital plan for   \nreview by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB\u2019s   \nreview is to ensure that we have a robust,    \nforward-looking capital planning process that \naccounts for our unique risks and that permits\ncontinued operation during times of economic  \nand financial stress. We submitted our 2020   \nCCAR capital plan in April 2020 and published \na summary of our annual DFAST results in June \n2020. See \u201cAvailable Information.\u201d The FRB    \nevaluates us based, in part, on whether we    \nhave the capital necessary to continue        \noperating under the baseline and severely     \nadverse scenarios provided by the FRB and     \nthose developed internally. This evaluation   \nalso takes into account our process for       \nidentifying risk, our controls and governance \nfor capital planning, and our guidelines for  \nmaking capital planning decisions. In         \naddition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make  \ncapital distributions (i.e., dividend payments\nand repurchases or redemptions of stock,      \nsubordinated debt or other capital securities)\nand issue capital, across the range of        \nmacroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific     \nassumptions. The FRB determines the SCB       \napplicable to us based on its own annual      \nstress test. The SCB under the Standardized   \napproach is calculated as (i) the difference  \nbetween our starting and minimum projected    \nCET1 capital ratios under the supervisory     \nseverely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned\ncommon stock dividends for each of the fourth \nthrough seventh quarters of the planning      \nhorizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-   \nweighted assets (RWAs). With respect to our   \n2020 CCAR submission, the FRB notified us that\nthe SCB applicable to us beginning on October \n1, 2020 will be 6.7% (bringing our            \nStandardized CET1 capital ratio requirement as\nof October 1, 2020 to 13.7%). In light of the \nimpact of the COVID-19pandemic on the economy,\nthe FRB required all large bank holding       \ncompanies (BHCs) to suspend stock repurchases \nthrough the third quarter of 2020, not to     \nincrease common stock dividends or pay common \nstock dividends in excess of their average net\nincome over the past four quarters, and to    \nresubmit their capital plans in the second    \nhalf of 2020 under updated scenarios. The FRB \nalso stated that it may extend the limitations\non capital distributions quarter-by-quarter.We\nplan to maintain both common and preferred    \ndividends, while complying with the SCB rule. \nIn addition, we will continue deploying       \ncapital to our businesses where returns are   \naccretive and otherwise return it to our      \nshareholders as permitted by the FRB. GS Bank \nUSA has its own capital planning process, but \nwas not required to conduct its annual stress \ntest in 2020. Goldman Sachs International     \n(GSI) and GSIB also have their own capital    \nplanning and stress testing process, which    \nincorporates internally designed stress tests \nand those required under the Prudential       \nRegulation Authority\u2019s (PRA) Internal Capital \nAdequacy Assessment Process. Contingency      \nCapital Plan. As part of our comprehensive    \ncapital management policy, we maintain a      \ncontingency capital plan. Our contingency     \ncapital plan provides a framework for         \nanalyzing and responding to a perceived or    \nactual capital deficiency, including, but not \nlimited to, identification of drivers of a    \ncapital deficiency, as well as mitigants and  \npotential actions. It outlines the appropriate\ncommunication procedures to follow during a   \ncrisis period, including internal             \ndissemination of information, as well as      \ntimely communication with external            \nstakeholders. Capital Attribution. We assess  \neach of our businesses\u2019 capital usage based on\nour internal assessment of risks, which       \nincorporates an attribution of all of our     \nrelevant regulatory capital requirements.     \nThese regulatory capital requirements are     \nallocated using our attributed equity         \nframework, which takes into consideration our \nmost binding capital constraints. Our most    \nbinding capital constraint is based on the    \nresults of the FRB\u2019s annual stress test       \nscenarios which include the Standardized risk-\nbased capital and leverage ratios.

We use our share          \nrepurchase program to help maintain the       \nappropriate level of common equity. The       \nrepurchase program is effected primarily      \nthrough regular open-market purchases (which  \nmay include repurchase plans designed to      \ncomply with Rule 10b5-1and accelerated share  \nrepurchases), the amounts and timing of which \nare determined primarily by our current and   \nprojected capital position and our capital    \nplan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The\namounts and timing of the repurchases may also\nbe influenced by general market conditions and\nthe prevailing price and trading volumes of   \nour common stock. As of June 2020, the        \nremaining share authorization under our       \nexisting repurchase program was 49.7 million  \nshares. See \u201cUnregistered Sales of Equity     \nSecurities and Use of Proceeds\u201d in Part II,   \nItem 2 of this Form 10-Qand Note 19 to the    \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about our share repurchase        \nprogram, and see above for information about  \nour capital planning and stress testing       \nprocess. Resolution Capital Models. In        \nconnection with our resolution planning       \nefforts, we have established a Resolution     \nCapital Adequacy and Positioning framework,   \nwhich is designed to ensure that our major    \nsubsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co.\nLLC (GS&Co.), GSI, GSIB, Goldman Sachs Japan  \nCo., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset        \nManagement, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Asset      \nManagement International) have access to      \nsufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the    \nform of equity, subordinated debt and         \nunsecured senior debt) so that they are able  \nto wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy\nfiling in accordance with our preferred       \nresolution strategy. In addition, we have     \nestablished a triggers and alerts framework,  \nwhich is designed to provide the Board of     \nDirectors of Group Inc. (Board) with          \ninformation needed to make an informed        \ndecision on whether and when to commence      \nbankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc. Rating  \nAgency Guidelines The credit rating agencies  \nassign credit ratings to the obligations of   \nGroup Inc., which directly issues or          \nguarantees substantially all of our senior    \nunsecured debt obligations. GS&Co. and GSI    \nhave been assigned long- and short-term issuer\nratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS \nBank USA and GSIB have also been assigned     \nlong- and short-term issuer ratings, as well  \nas ratings on their long- and short-term bank \ndeposits. In addition, credit rating agencies \nhave assigned ratings to debt obligations of  \ncertain other subsidiaries of Group Inc. The  \nlevel and composition of our equity capital   \nare among the many factors considered in      \ndetermining our credit ratings. Each agency   \nhas its own definition of eligible capital and\nmethodology for evaluating capital adequacy,  \nand assessments are generally based on a      \ncombination of factors rather than a single   \ncalculation. See \u201cRisk Management \u2014 Liquidity \nRisk Management \u2014 Credit Ratings\u201d for further \ninformation about credit ratings of Group     \nInc., GS Bank USA, GSIB, GS&Co. and GSI.      \nConsolidated Regulatory Capital We are subject\nto consolidated regulatory capital            \nrequirements which are calculated in          \naccordance with the regulations of the FRB    \n(Capital Framework). Under the Capital        \nFramework, we are an \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d      \nbanking organization and have been designated \nas a global systemically important bank       \n(G-SIB). The capital requirements calculated  \nin accordance with the Capital Framework      \ninclude the risk-based capital buffers and    \nG-SIBsurcharge. The risk-based capital        \nbuffers, applicable to us for 2020, include   \nthe capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and   \nthe countercyclical capital buffer, which the \nFRB has set to zero percent. In addition, the \nG-SIBsurcharge applicable to us for 2020 is   \n2.5% based on 2018 financial data and 2.5% for\n2021 based on 2019 financial data. Based on   \nfinancial data for the six months ended June  \n2020, our current estimate is that we are     \nabove the threshold for the 3.0%              \nG-SIBsurcharge. We expect that our            \nG-SIBsurcharge may remain above the 3%        \nthreshold over the next three years. This     \nincrease would be effective on January 1 of   \nthe year that is one full calendar year after \nthe increased G-SIBsurcharge is finalized. The\nG-SIBsurcharge and countercyclical buffer in  \nthe future may differ due to additional       \nguidance from our regulators and/or positional\nchanges. Our target Standardized CET1 capital \nratio over the medium term is between 13.0%   \nand 13.5% (including management buffers)based \nupon the execution of our previously announced\nstrategic initiatives and achievement of      \ncapital efficiencies.

Regulations have been adopted or   \nare being considered by regulators and policy \nmakers worldwide. Given that many of the new  \nand proposed rules are highly complex, the    \nfull impact of regulatory reform will not be  \nknown until the rules are implemented and     \nmarket practices develop under the final      \nregulations. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in   \nPart I, Item 1 of the 2019 Form 10-Kfor       \nfurther information about the laws, rules and \nregulations and proposed laws, rules and      \nregulations that apply to us and our          \noperations. Other Matters Brexit. In March    \n2017, the U.K. government commenced the formal\nproceedings to withdraw from the E.U. The E.U.\nand the U.K. agreed to a withdrawal agreement \n(the Withdrawal Agreement), which became      \neffective on January 31, 2020. The transition \nperiod under the Withdrawal Agreement will    \nlast until the end of December 2020 to allow  \nthe two sides to negotiate a future trade     \nagreement. During the transition period, the  \nU.K. will be treated as if it were a member   \nstate of the E.U. and therefore the existing  \narrangements between the U.K. and the E.U.    \nwill not change. The Withdrawal Agreement     \nprovides for the possibility of an extension  \nof the transition period for either one or two\nmore years. However, the U.K. formally        \nconfirmed to the E.U. in June 2020 that it    \nwill not seek an extension period beyond      \nDecember 31, 2020. The E.U. and the U.K. are  \nstill in the process of completing their      \nassessments of equivalence, based upon the    \nexisting non-E.U.country equivalence regimes. \nThere is significant uncertainty as to the    \noutcome of those assessments. We are          \nmonitoring the ongoing development related to \nBrexit and continue to prepare for a scenario \nwhere the U.K. financial services firms will  \nlose access to E.U. markets on December 31,   \n2020 (a \u201chard\u201d Brexit) while ensuring we      \nremain flexible and well positioned to allow  \nour clients to benefit from any more favorable\nscenarios. Our planning also recognizes that  \nafter the end of the transition period, we can\nrely on a degree of continuing access for our \nU.K. entities pursuant to national cross-     \nborder access regimes in certain jurisdictions\n(for example, based on specific licenses or   \nexemptions). See \u201cRegulatory Matters and Other\nDevelopments \u2014 Other Developments\u201d in Part II,\nItem 7 of the 2019 Form 10-Kfor further       \ninformation about our plan to manage a hard   \nBrexit scenario. Replacement of Interbank     \nOffered Rates (IBORs), including LIBOR.       \nCentral banks and regulators in a number of   \nmajor jurisdictions (for example, U.S., U.K., \nE.U., Switzerland and Japan) have convened    \nworking groups to find, and implement the     \ntransition to, suitable replacements for      \nIBORs. The FCA, which regulates LIBOR, has    \nannounced that it will not compel panel banks \nto contribute to LIBOR after 2021. In the     \nfirst quarter of 2020, the FCA, alongside the \nBank of England and the members of the Working\nGroup on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates,  \nissued a statement reaffirming that firms     \ncannot rely on LIBOR being published after    \n2021. Accordingly, we continue to make        \nprogress on our LIBOR transition program in   \nline with this deadline. We have created a    \nprogram that focuses on achieving an orderly  \ntransition from IBORs to alternative risk-free\nreference rates for us and our clients. As    \npart of this transition, we continue to       \nactively engage with our regulators and       \nclients, as well as participate in central    \nbank and sector working groups. We have issued\ndebt and deposits linked to the Secured       \nOvernight Financing Rate (SOFR) and Sterling  \nOvernight Index Average (SONIA) and have      \nexecuted SOFR- and SONIA-based derivative     \ncontracts to make markets and facilitate      \nclient activities. Where possible, we continue\nto execute transactions in the market to      \nreduce our LIBOR exposures arising from hedges\nto our fixed-rate debt issuances and replace  \nwith alternative risk-free reference rates    \nexposures.

Governments around the world\nremain highly focused on mitigating the risk  \nof further spread of COVID-19and continue to  \nmanage their response to the crisis, which has\nincluded measures such as quarantines, travel \nrestrictions and business curtailments. In    \nresponse to the COVID-19pandemic, we activated\nand have continued to successfully execute on \nour Business Continuity Planning (BCP)        \nstrategy. Our priority has been to safeguard  \nour employees and to seek to ensure continuity\nof business operations on behalf of our       \nclients. Our business continuity response to  \nthe COVID-19pandemic continues to be managed  \nby a central team, which is led by our chief  \nadministrative officer and chief medical      \nofficer, and includes senior management within\nRisk and the chief operating officers across  \nall regions and businesses. As a result of our\nBCP plan, the vast majority of our employees  \ncontinue to work remotely. We have been       \nfocused on establishing policies and protocols\nthat will enable a phased return to office,   \ntaking into account the readiness of people,  \ncommunities and facilities. As communities    \nwhere we operate begin to reopen, we are      \ntaking the necessary steps to return to the   \noffice in a safe manner. We are in constant   \ndialogue with key stakeholders to assess      \nhealth and safety conditions across all of our\noffice locations focusing on these matters,   \nsuch as controls around building access,      \nstrict physical distancing measures and       \nenhanced cleaning regimes. We have started to \ngradually return employees across most of our \noffice locations on a voluntary basis, with   \nthe most progress occurring in the E.U. and in\nparts of Asia. In the Americas, we have       \nrecently initiated our return to office       \nstrategy, including at our 200 West Street New\nYork headquarters. Progress going forward for \neach of our offices around the world will be  \ndictated by the circumstances in each region. \nOur systems and infrastructure have continued \nto support all of our activities. We have     \nmaintained regular and active communication   \namong senior management, the rest of our      \nemployees and the Board. Decision-making      \ncontinues to occur through a variety of senior\nmanagement meetings. Our Management Committee \nand other senior leaders meet regularly. Our  \nexecutive officers have continued to provide  \nregular and enhanced communications to promote\nconnectivity with our clients and employees   \nworldwide. Furthermore, we have ongoing       \ndialogues with vendors intended to ensure that\nthey continue to meet our criteria for        \nbusiness continuity. Our liquidity position   \nduring the second quarter of 2020 remained    \nstrong. Our GCLA averaged a record $290       \nbillion for the second quarter of 2020, an    \nincrease of $47 billion compared with the     \nfirst quarter of 2020. Our deposits increased \nby $48 billion to $268 billion compared with  \nthe first quarter of 2020. We continue to     \naccess our traditional funding sources in the \nnormal course and service our debt and other  \nobligations on a timely basis. Our CET1       \ncapital ratios under the Standardized approach\nwas 13.3% as of the end of the second quarter \nof 2020, up 80 basis points compared with the \nfirst quarter of 2020, as we effectively      \nmanaged our capital while deploying balance   \nsheet for our clients. We suspended stock     \nrepurchases through the second quarter of 2020\nand, consistent with the FRB\u2019s requirement for\nall large BHCs, we will extend the suspension \nof stock repurchases through the third quarter\nof 2020.

As a     \nresult of the COVID-19pandemic, we have had to\napply a greater degree of judgment in making  \ncertain accounting estimates and assumptions. \nThe uncertainty regarding future developments \nassociated with the COVID-19pandemic and its  \npotential economic impact creates added       \nchallenges and complexities in determining the\nallowance for credit losses, as the process is\ninherently judgmental and requires estimation \nof expected credit losses based on economic   \nforecasts and other considerations. The       \nuncertainty regarding the future economic     \nconsequences of the COVID-19pandemic also     \naffects the estimation of the fair value for  \nless liquid financial instruments that lack   \nprice transparency, where valuation involves  \njudgment regarding estimated future cash flows\nor other significant unobservable inputs.     \nAlthough markets normalized during the second \nquarter of 2020, determining the valuation for\ncertain Level 3 instruments remains           \nchallenging in the current environment. See   \nNote 9 to the consolidated financial          \nstatements for further information about our  \nallowance for credit losses and Note 4 to the \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about fair value measurements. As \na result of the dramatic change in the        \nmacroeconomic environment since we last       \nperformed a goodwill impairment test in the   \nfourth quarter of 2019, we assessed goodwill  \nfor impairment as of June 2020 and determined \nthat it was not impaired.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis During   \nthe second quarter of 2020, financial markets \ncontinued to experience elevated levels of    \nvolatility, which contributed to high volumes \nof client activity. Our average daily VaR for \nthe second quarter of 2020 was $122 million,  \nan increase of $70 million compared with June \n2019, reflecting, among other things, the role\nthat we have played in applying our risk-     \nintermediation expertise and deploying our    \nbalance sheet to meet the needs of our clients\nas they navigate a volatile market            \nenvironment. We continue to be proactive in   \nour approach to managing market risk levels,  \nwhich entails ongoing review and monitoring of\nexposures and focusing on ways to mitigate    \nrisk. With respect to credit risk, the        \nsignificantly reduced level of business       \nactivity due to the COVID-19pandemic continues\nto weigh on the credit worthiness of the      \nborrowers, particularly in industries that    \nhave been most severely impacted by the       \neconomic disruption, including oil and gas,   \ngaming and lodging, and airlines. We had net  \npaydowns of approximately $9 billion on       \nrelationship lending commitments during the   \nsecond quarter of 2020, which was a partial   \nreversal of the $19 billion of drawdowns      \nduring the first quarter of 2020. However,    \ncredit risk, in general, remains elevated     \nacross the banking industry. Throughout this  \ncrisis, we have remained highly focused on    \nmonitoring of credit exposures and management \nof margin calls and disputes. Our risk        \npositions remained balanced, controlled and   \nadequately provisioned for, both in terms of  \ncounterparty risk and sector exposure. See    \n\u201cMarket Risk Management\u201d and \u201cCredit Risk     \nManagement\u201d for further information. Our      \nactions in response to COVID-19have included  \ngranting forbearance to certain corporate and \nother borrowers who have made requests to     \ndefer payments. We had approximately $1.20    \nbillion of corporate loans and approximately  \n$370 million of commercial real estate loans  \nunder forbearance as of June 2020. In         \naddition, we continued to make our customer   \nassistance program available in the second    \nquarter of 2020, providing borrowers of       \ninstallment and credit card loans the ability \nto defer payments without incurring interest  \ncharges and have permitted Marcus depositors  \nto access certificates of deposit early       \nwithout a penalty. As of June 2020,           \ninstallment and credit card loans with a gross\ncarrying value of approximately $640 million  \nwere enrolled in the customer assistance      \nprogram. The COVID-19pandemic has created     \nsignificant uncertainty regarding the         \noperating environment for the remainder of    \n2020 and possibly longer, as the duration and \nfuture course of the pandemic cannot be       \npredicted at this time. A sustained period of \nweak economic conditions as a result of the   \npandemic would be detrimental to our          \nbusinesses as it would negatively affect      \nfactors that are important to our operating   \nperformance, such as the level of client      \nactivity, creditworthiness of counterparties  \nand borrowers, and the amount of our assets   \nunder supervision.

Overview and        \nStructure of Risk Management Overview We      \nbelieve that effective risk management is     \ncritical to our success. Accordingly, we have \nestablished an enterprise risk management     \nframework that employs a comprehensive,       \nintegrated approach to risk management, and is\ndesigned to enable comprehensive risk         \nmanagement processes through which we         \nidentify, assess, monitor and manage the risks\nwe assume in conducting our activities. Our   \nrisk management structure is built around     \nthree core components: governance, processes  \nand people. Governance. Risk management       \ngovernance starts with the Board, which both  \ndirectly and through its committees, including\nits Risk Committee, oversees our risk         \nmanagement policies and practices implemented \nthrough the enterprise risk management        \nframework. The Board is also responsible for  \nthe annual review and approval of our risk    \nappetite statement. The risk appetite         \nstatement describes the levels and types of   \nrisk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in \norder to achieve our objectives included in   \nour strategic business plan, while remaining  \nin compliance with regulatory requirements.   \nThe Board reviews our strategic business plan \nand is ultimately responsible for overseeing  \nand providing direction about our strategy and\nrisk appetite.                                \n                                            \n  133    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Because we maintain a highly   \n       liquid balance sheet, the holding      \n       period of certain of our assets may    \n       be materially shorter than their       \n       contractual maturity dates.            \n                                              \nOur goal is to ensure                         \nthat we maintain                              \nsufficient liquidity                          \nto fund our assets and                        \nmeet our contractual                          \nand contingent                                \nobligations in normal                         \ntimes, as well as                             \nduring periods of                             \nmarket stress.

Although we have   \n  \u2022    access to various central bank         \n       funding programs, we do not assume     \n       reliance on additional sources of      \n       funding in a liquidity crisis; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n       A combination of contractual           \n       outflows, such as upcoming maturities  \n       of unsecured debt, and contingent      \n       outflows, including, but not limited   \n       to, the withdrawal of customer credit  \n       balances in our prime brokerage        \n  \u2022    business, increase in variation        \n       margin requirements due to adverse     \n       changes in the value of our            \n       exchange-traded                        \n       andOTC-clearedderivatives, and         \n       withdrawals of deposits that have no   \n       contractual maturity.                  \n                                              \nIntraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday        \nLiquidity Model measures our intraday         \nliquidity needs using a scenario analysis     \ncharacterized by the same qualitative elements\nas our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model   \nassesses the risk of increased intraday       \nliquidity requirements during a scenario where\naccess to sources of intraday liquidity may   \nbecome constrained. Long-Term Stress Testing. \nWe utilize longer-term stress tests to take a \nforward view on our liquidity position through\nprolonged stress periods in which we          \nexperience a severe liquidity stress and      \nrecover in an environment that continues to be\nchallenging. We are focused on ensuring       \nconservative asset-liability management to    \nprepare for a prolonged period of potential   \nstress, seeking to maintain a diversified     \nfunding profile with an appropriate tenor,    \ntaking into consideration the characteristics \nand liquidity profile of our assets.          \nResolution Liquidity Models. In connection    \nwith our resolution planning efforts, we have \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy \nand Positioning framework, which estimates    \nliquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a\nstressed environment. The liquidity needs are \nmeasured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow  \nassumptions and include certain additional    \ninter-affiliate exposures. We have also       \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Execution\nNeed framework, which measures the liquidity  \nneeds of our major subsidiaries to stabilize  \nand wind-down following a Group Inc.          \nbankruptcy filing in accordance with our      \npreferred resolution strategy. In addition, we\nhave established a triggers and alerts        \nframework, which is designed to provide the   \nBoard with information needed to make an      \ninformed decision on whether and when to      \ncommence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\nLimits We use liquidity risk limits at various\nlevels and across liquidity risk types to     \nmanage the size of our liquidity exposures.   \nLimits are measured relative to acceptable    \nlevels of risk given our liquidity risk       \ntolerance. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for information about the limit   \napproval process. Limits are monitored by     \nTreasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is\nresponsible for identifying and escalating to \nsenior management and/or the appropriate risk \ncommittee, on a timely basis, instances where \nlimits have been exceeded.                    \n                                            \n  141    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow   \nand Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a    \nrequirement for Group Inc., as well as a      \nstandalone requirement for each of our major  \nbroker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding  \nIHC is required to provide the necessary      \nliquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary   \ncourse of business, and is also obligated to  \nprovide capital and liquidity support to major\nsubsidiaries in the event of our material     \nfinancial distress or failure. Liquidity held \ndirectly in each of our major broker-dealer   \nand bank subsidiaries is intended for use only\nby that subsidiary to meet its liquidity      \nrequirements and is assumed not to be         \navailable to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless \n(i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no\nadditional regulatory, tax or other           \nrestrictions. In addition, the Modeled        \nLiquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model\nalso incorporate a broader assessment of      \nstandalone liquidity requirements for other   \nsubsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA\ndirectly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to      \nsupport such requirements. Other Unencumbered \nAssets. In addition to our GCLA, we have a    \nsignificant amount of other unencumbered cash \nand financial instruments, including other    \ngovernment obligations, high-grade money      \nmarket securities, corporate obligations,     \nmarginable equities, loans and cash deposits  \nnot included in our GCLA. The fair value of   \nour unencumbered assets averaged $194.05      \nbillion for the three months ended June 2020  \nand $205.95 billion for the three months ended\nMarch 2020. We do not consider these assets   \nliquid enough to be eligible for our GCLA.    \nLiquidity Regulatory Framework As a BHC, we   \nare subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage   \nRatio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the\nU.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR\nrule requires organizations to maintain an    \nadequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows   \nunder an acute short-term liquidity stress    \nscenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by \nsubsidiaries that is in excess of their       \nminimum requirement and is subject to transfer\nrestrictions. We are required to maintain a   \nminimum LCR of 100%. We expect that           \nfluctuations in client activity, business mix \nand the market environment will impact our    \nLCR.                                          \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    142  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Stress testing is a method of \ndetermining the effect of various hypothetical\nstress scenarios. We use stress testing to    \nexamine risks of specific portfolios, as well \nas the potential impact of our significant    \nrisk exposures. We use a variety of stress    \ntesting techniques to calculate the potential \nloss from a wide range of market moves on our \nportfolios, including firmwide stress tests,  \nsensitivity analysis and scenario analysis.   \nThe results of our various stress tests are   \nanalyzed together for risk management         \npurposes. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk \nManagement\u201d for information about firmwide    \nstress tests. Sensitivity analysis is used to \nquantify the impact of a market move in a     \nsingle risk factor across all positions (e.g.,\nequity prices or credit spreads) using a      \nvariety of defined market shocks, ranging from\nthose that could be expected over a one-      \ndaytime horizon up to those that could take   \nmany months to occur. We also use sensitivity \nanalysis to quantify the impact of the default\nof any single entity, which captures the risk \nof large or concentrated exposures. Scenario  \nanalysis is used to quantify the impact of a  \nspecified event, including how the event      \nimpacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. \nFor example, for sovereign stress testing we  \ncalculate potential direct exposure associated\nwith our sovereign positions, as well as the  \ncorresponding debt, equity and currency       \nexposures associated with our non-            \nsovereignpositions that may be impacted by the\nsovereign distress. When conducting scenario  \nanalysis, we often consider a number of       \npossible outcomes for each scenario, ranging  \nfrom moderate to severely adverse market      \nimpacts. In addition, these stress tests are  \nconstructed using both historical events and  \nforward-looking hypothetical scenarios. Unlike\nVaR measures, which have an implied           \nprobability because they are calculated at a  \nspecified confidence level, there may not be  \nan implied probability that our stress testing\nscenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing \nis used to model both moderate and more       \nextreme moves in underlying market factors.   \nWhen estimating potential loss, we generally  \nassume that our positions cannot be reduced or\nhedged (although experience demonstrates that \nwe are generally able to do so).              \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    146  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

We determine the country of risk by \nthe location of the counterparty, issuer or   \nunderlier\u2019s assets, where they generate       \nrevenue, the country in which they are        \nheadquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim \nagainst them could be enforced, and/or the    \ngovernment whose policies affect their ability\nto repay their obligations. We monitor our    \ncredit exposure to a specific country both at \nthe individual counterparty level, as well as \nat the aggregate country level.

By   \nidentifying these statements for you in this  \nmanner, we are alerting you to the possibility\nthat our actual results, financial condition  \nand liquidity may differ, possibly materially,\nfrom the anticipated results, financial       \ncondition and liquidity in these forward-     \nlooking statements. Important factors that    \ncould cause our results, financial condition  \nand capital actions to differ from those in   \nthese statements include, among others, those \ndescribed below and in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part \nII, Item 1A of this Form 10-Qand in Part I,   \nItem 1A of the 2019 Form 10-K. Statements     \nabout our investment banking transaction      \nbacklog are subject to the risk that such     \ntransactions may be modified or may not be    \ncompleted at all and related net revenues may \nnot be realized or may be materially less than\nexpected. Important factors that could have   \nsuch a result include, for underwriting       \ntransactions, a decline or weakness in general\neconomic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, \nvolatility in the securities markets or an    \nadverse development with respect to the issuer\nof the securities and, for financial advisory \ntransactions, a decline in the securities     \nmarkets, an inability to obtain adequate      \nfinancing, an adverse development with respect\nto a party to the transaction or a failure to \nobtain a required regulatory approval. For    \ninformation about other important factors that\ncould adversely affect our investment banking \ntransactions, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part II,  \nItem 1A of this Form 10-Qand in Part I, Item  \n1A of the 2019 Form 10-K. Statements about our\nfuture effective income tax rate are subject  \nto the risk that it may differ from the       \nanticipated rate indicated in such statements,\npossibly materially, due to, among other      \nthings, changes in our earnings mix, our      \nprofitability and entities in which we        \ngenerate profits, the assumptions we have made\nin forecasting our expected tax rate, as well \nas guidance that may be issued by the U.S.    \nInternal Revenue Service. Statements about our\nNSFR and SCB are based on our current         \ninterpretation and expectations of the        \nrelevant proposal and final rule, and reflect \nsignificant assumptions about how our NSFR and\nSCB are calculated. Our actual NSFR will      \ndepend on the final rule and, for the SCB, the\nresults of the applicable supervisory stress  \ntests, and the methods used to calculate our  \nNSFR and SCB may differ, possibly materially, \nfrom those used to calculate our NSFR and SCB \nfor future disclosures. Statements about the  \nlevel of compensation expense, including as a \npercentage of operating expenses, and our     \nefficiency ratio as our platform business     \ninitiatives reach scale are subject to the    \nrisks that the compensation and other costs to\noperate our businesses, including platform    \ninitiatives, may be greater than currently    \nexpected.                                     \n                                            \n  159    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis          \nStatements about our expected provisions for  \ncredit losses are subject to the risk that    \nactual credit losses may differ and our       \nexpectations may change, possibly materially, \nfrom that currently anticipated due to, among \nother things, changes to the composition of   \nour loan portfolio and changes in the economic\nenvironment in future periods and our         \nforecasts of future economic conditions, as   \nwell as changes in our models, policies and   \nother management judgments.

Statements about our  \ntarget ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratio, and  \nhow they can be achieved, are based on our    \ncurrent expectations regarding the capital    \nrequirements applicable to us and are subject \nto the risk that our actual capital           \nrequirements may be higher than currently     \nanticipated because of, among other factors,  \nchanges in the regulatory capital requirements\napplicable to us resulting from changes in    \nregulations or the interpretation or          \napplication of existing regulations or changes\nin the nature and composition of our          \nactivities. Statements about the timing,      \ncosts, profitability, benefits and other      \naspects of business and expense savings       \ninitiatives, the level and composition of more\ndurable revenues and increases in market share\nare based on our current expectations         \nregarding our ability to implement these      \ninitiatives and actual results may differ,    \npossibly materially, from current expectations\ndue to, among other things, a delay in the    \ntiming of these initiatives, increased        \ncompetition and an inability to reduce        \nexpenses and grow businesses with durable     \nrevenues. Statements about planned 2020 parent\nvanilla debt issuances and the amount of GCLA \nwe expect to hold are subject to the risk that\nactual issuances and GCLA levels may differ,  \npossibly materially, from that currently      \nexpected due to changes in market conditions, \nbusiness opportunities or our funding and     \nprojected liquidity needs. Statements about   \nthe future state of our liquidity and         \nregulatory capital ratios, as well as our     \nprospective capital distributions (including  \ndividends), are subject to the risk that our  \nactual liquidity, regulatory capital ratios   \nand capital distributions may differ, possibly\nmaterially, from what is currently expected   \ndue to, among other things, the need to use   \ncapital to support clients, increased         \nregulatory requirements and changes to the    \ncomposition of our balance sheet. Statements  \nabout the agreement in principle relating to  \n1MDB are subject to the execution of          \ndefinitive documentation, and may change,     \npossibly materially, from what is currently   \nexpected. Statements about the risk exposure  \nrelated to the guarantee are subject to the   \nrisk that the actual value of assets and      \nproceeds from assets seized and returned to   \nthe government of Malaysia may be less than   \ncurrently anticipated.                        \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form 10-Q    160  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nItem 3.

Controls and     \nProcedures As of the end of the period covered\nby this report, an evaluation was carried out \nby our management, with the participation of  \nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief         \nFinancial Officer, of the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined\nin Rule 13a-15(e)under the Exchange Act).     \nBased on that evaluation, our Chief Executive \nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded \nthat these disclosure controls and procedures \nwere effective as of the end of the period    \ncovered by this report. In addition, no change\nin our internal control over financial        \nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)under  \nthe Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter \nended June 2020 that has materially affected, \nor is reasonably likely to materially affect, \nour internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal      \nProceedings We are involved in a number of    \njudicial, regulatory and arbitration          \nproceedings concerning matters arising in     \nconnection with the conduct of our businesses.\nMany of these proceedings are in early stages,\nand many of these cases seek an indeterminate \namount of damages. We have estimated the upper\nend of the range of reasonably possible       \naggregate loss for matters where we have been \nable to estimate a range and we believe, based\non currently available information, that the  \nresults of matters where we have not been able\nto estimate a range of reasonably possible    \nloss, in the aggregate, will not have a       \nmaterial adverse effect on our financial      \ncondition, but may be material to our         \noperating results in a given period. Given the\nrange of litigation and investigations        \npresently under way, our litigation expenses  \ncan be expected to remain high.

Item 1A. Risk Factors Our        \nbusinesses, financial condition, liquidity and\nresults of operations have been, and may in   \nthe future be, adversely affected by the      \nCOVID-19pandemic. The coronavirus             \n(COVID-19)pandemic has created economic and   \nfinancial disruptions that have in the past   \nadversely affected, and may in the future     \nadversely affect, our business, financial     \ncondition, liquidity and results of           \noperations. The extent to which the           \nCOVID-19pandemic will negatively affect our   \nbusinesses, financial condition, liquidity and\nresults of operations will depend on future   \ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and  \ncannot be predicted. While financial markets  \nrebounded and economies began to reopen in the\nsecond quarter of 2020, many of the           \ncircumstances that arose or became more       \npronounced after the onset of the             \nCOVID-19pandemic persisted at the end of the  \nquarter, including (i) muted levels of        \nbusiness activity across many sectors of the  \neconomy, relatively weak consumer confidence  \nand high unemployment; (ii) elevated levels of\nmarket volatility; (iii) the federal funds    \nrate and yields on U.S. Treasury securities   \nnear zero; (iv) significantly reduced merger  \nand acquisition activity and substantial      \nuncertainty about whether previously announced\ndeals will be completed or restructured; (v)  \nheightened credit risk and increased incidence\nof defaults across various industries,        \nincluding oil and gas, gaming and lodging, and\nairlines; (vi) greater emphasis by investors  \non liquidity products, which generate lower   \nfees, relative to risk assets; and (vii)      \nhigher cybersecurity, information security and\noperational risks as a result of work-from-   \nhome arrangements. Depending on the duration  \nand severity of the pandemic going forward, as\nwell as the effects of the pandemic on        \nconsumer and corporate confidence, the        \nconditions noted above could continue for an  \nextended period and other adverse developments\nmay occur or reoccur, including (i) a repeat, \nor worse, of the decline in the valuation of  \nequity, fixed-income and commodity markets    \nthat occurred at the outset of the pandemic;  \n(ii) further declines in U.S. interest rates, \nto zero or below; (iii) market dislocations   \nthat may make hedging strategies less         \neffective or ineffective; (iv) a reduction in \nfees on AUS due to declines in the valuation  \nof assets or a protracted trend toward asset  \nclasses that generate lower fees; (v)         \ndisruption in the new issuance markets for    \ndebt and equity, leading to a decline in      \nactivity; (vi) a further deterioration in the \nliquidity profile of corporate borrowers,     \nresulting in additional draws on credit lines;\nand (vii) greater challenges in valuing       \nderivative positions and associated           \ncollateral, leading to significant increases  \nin collateral calls and valuation disputes.   \n                                            \n  161    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0June 2020\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe effects of the                            \nCOVID-19pandemic on                           \neconomic and market                           \nconditions have in the                        \npast and may in the                           \nfuture also increase                          \ndemands on our                                \nliquidity as we meet                          \nclient needs.
