The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a      \nvoting interest entity or a variable interest \nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)   \nthe total equity investment at risk is        \nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity  \nholders have the power to direct the          \nactivities of the entity that most            \nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the    \nentity and the right to receive the residual  \nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting  \ninterest entity is ownership of a majority    \nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest \nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable  \nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that    \nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a \nvoting interest entity. The firm has a        \ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when  \nthe firm has a variable interest or interests \nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct  \nthe activities of the VIE that most           \nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic       \nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb \nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive     \nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially  \nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for    \nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method \nInvestments. When the firm does not have a    \ncontrolling financial interest in an entity   \nbut can exert significant influence over the  \nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair \nvalue by electing the fair value option       \navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant        \ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns \n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstancecommon stock. In certain cases, the  \nfirm applies the equity method of accounting  \nto new investments that are strategic in      \nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s       \nprincipal business activities, when the firm  \nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or   \nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less     \nsignificant. See Note 8 for further           \ninformation about equity-method investments.  \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    6  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investment Funds. The firm has    \nformed investment funds with third-party      \ninvestors. These funds are typically organized\nas limited partnerships or limited liability  \ncompanies for which the firm acts as general  \npartner or manager. Generally, the firm does  \nnot hold a majority of the economic interests \nin these funds. These funds are usually voting\ninterest entities and generally are not       \nconsolidated because third-party investors    \ntypically have rights to terminate the funds  \nor to remove the firm as general partner or   \nmanager. Investments in these funds are       \ngenerally measured at net asset value (NAV)   \nand are included in investments. See Notes 8, \n18 and 22 for further information about       \ninvestments in funds. Use of Estimates        \nPreparation of these consolidated financial   \nstatements requires management to make certain\nestimates and assumptions, the most important \nof which relate to fair value measurements,   \nthe allowance for credit losses on loans and  \nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,    \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and accounting for income    \ntaxes. These estimates and assumptions are    \nbased on the best available information but   \nactual results could be materially different. \nRevenue Recognition Financial Assets and      \nLiabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and \nliabilities and certain investments are       \ncarried at fair value either under the fair   \nvalue option or in accordance with other U.S. \nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to    \naccount for certain of its loans and other    \nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nby electing the fair value option. The fair   \nvalue of a financial instrument is the amount \nthat would be received to sell an asset or    \npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly    \ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked \nto bid prices and financial liabilities are   \nmarked to offer prices. Fair value            \nmeasurements do not include transaction costs.\nFair value gains or losses are generally      \nincluded in market making or other principal  \ntransactions. See Note 4 for further          \ninformation about fair value measurements.    \nRevenue from Contracts with Clients. The firm \nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with \nclients for services, such as investment      \nbanking, investment management, and execution \nand clearing (contracts with clients), when   \nthe performance obligations related to the    \nunderlying transaction are completed. Revenues\nfrom contracts with clients represent         \napproximately 40% of total non-               \ninterestrevenues (including approximately 80% \nof investment banking revenues, approximately \n95% of investment management revenues and all \ncommissions and fees) for the three months    \nended March 2022, and approximately 35% of    \ntotal non-interestrevenues (including         \napproximately 90% of investment banking       \nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment     \nmanagement revenues and all commissions and   \nfees) for the three months ended March 2021.  \nSee Note 25 for information about net revenues\nby business segment. Investment Banking       \nAdvisory. Fees from financial advisory        \nassignments are recognized in revenues when   \nthe services related to the underlying        \ntransaction are completed under the terms of  \nthe assignment. Non-refundabledeposits and    \nmilestone payments in connection with         \nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized \nin revenues upon completion of the underlying \ntransaction or when the assignment is         \notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with \nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized \nwhen incurred and are included in transaction \nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such\nexpenses are included in investment banking   \nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon   \ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses      \nassociated with underwriting assignments are  \ngenerally deferred until the related revenue  \nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise  \nconcluded. Such expenses are included in      \ntransaction based expenses for completed      \nassignments.                                  \n                                           \n  7    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investment Management The firm    \nearns management fees and incentive fees for  \ninvestment management services, which are     \nincluded in investment management revenues.   \nThe firm makes payments to brokers and        \nadvisors related to the placement of the      \nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),  \nwhich are included in transaction based       \nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily net asset value and are received        \nmonthly. Management fees for hedge funds and  \nseparately managed accounts are calculated as \na percentage of month-endnet asset value and  \nare generally received quarterly. Management  \nfees for private equity funds are calculated  \nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are received quarterly, \nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the   \nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.      \nDistribution fees paid by the firm are        \ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net     \nasset value or the committed capital. Such    \nfees are included in transaction based        \nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are  \ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or     \nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other   \nperformance target. Incentive fees are        \ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a   \nfund. Fees that are based on performance over \na twelve-month period are subject to          \nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment \nperformance over the life of the fund, future \ninvestment underperformance may require fees  \npreviously distributed to the firm to be      \nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned   \nfrom a fund or separately managed account are \nrecognized when it is probable that a         \nsignificant reversal of such fees will not    \noccur, which is generally when such fees are  \nno longer subject to fluctuations in the      \nmarket value of investments held by the fund  \nor separately managed account. Therefore,     \nincentive fees recognized during the period   \nmay relate to performance obligations         \nsatisfied in previous periods. Commissions and\nFees The firm earns commissions and fees from \nexecuting and clearing client transactions on \nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter(OTC) transactions.           \nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides \nthird-party research services to clients in   \nconnection with certain soft-dollar           \narrangements. Third-party research costs      \nincurred by the firm in connection with such  \narrangements are presented net within         \ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance   \nObligations Remaining performance obligations \nare services that the firm has committed to   \nperform in the future in connection with its  \ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining  \nperformance obligations are generally related \nto its financial advisory assignments and     \ncertain investment management activities.     \nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory    \nassignments cannot be determined until the    \noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s    \ninvestment management activities, where fees  \nare calculated based on the net asset value of\nthe fund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining       \nperformance obligations cannot be determined  \nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in   \nthe market value of investments held by the   \nfund or separately managed account. The firm  \nis able to determine the future revenues      \nassociated with management fees calculated    \nbased on committed capital. As of March 2022, \nsubstantially all future net revenues         \nassociated with such remaining performance    \nobligations will be recognized through 2029.  \nAnnual revenues associated with such          \nperformance obligations average less than $   \n250million through 2029. Transfers of         \nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has  \nrelinquished control over the assets          \ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses   \nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or     \nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s        \ncontinuing involvement with transferred       \nfinancial assets are initially recognized at  \nfair value. For transfers of financial assets \nthat are not accounted for as sales, the      \nassets are generally included in trading      \nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a \ncollateralized financing, with the related    \ninterest expense recognized over the life of  \nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further      \ninformation about transfers of financial      \nassets accounted for as collateralized        \nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted \nfor as sales.                                 \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    8  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm segregates cash for   \nregulatory and other purposes related to      \nclient activity. Cash and cash equivalents    \nsegregated for regulatory and other purposes  \nwere $ 23.31billion as of March 2022 and $    \n24.87billion as of December 2021. In addition,\nthe firm segregates securities for regulatory \nand other purposes related to client activity.\nSee Note 11 for further information about     \nsegregated securities. Customer and Other     \nReceivables Customer and other receivables    \nincluded receivables from customers and       \ncounterparties of $ 99.76billion as of March  \n2022 and $ 103.82billion as of December 2021, \nand receivables from brokers, dealers and     \nclearing organizations of $ 74.88 billion as  \nof March 2022 and $ 56.85 billion as of       \nDecember 2021. Such receivables primarily     \nconsist of customer margin loans, receivables \nresulting from unsettled transactions and     \ncollateral posted in connection with certain  \nderivative transactions. Substantially all of \nthese receivables are accounted for at        \namortized cost net of any allowance for credit\nlosses, which generally approximates fair     \nvalue. As these receivables are not accounted \nfor at fair value, they are not included in   \nthe firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4    \nthrough 10. Had these receivables been        \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,  \nsubstantially all would have been classified  \nin level 2 as of both March 2022 and December \n2021. See Note 10 for further information     \nabout customer and other receivables accounted\nfor at fair value under the fair value option.\nInterest on customer and other receivables is \nrecognized over the life of the transaction   \nand included in interest income. Customer and \nother receivables includes receivables from   \ncontracts with clients and contract assets.   \nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to \nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s    \nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n2.77billion as of March 2022 and $ 3.01billion\nas of December 2021. As of both March 2022 and\nDecember 2021 contract assets were not        \nmaterial. Customer and Other Payables Customer\nand other payables included payables to       \ncustomers and counterparties of $             \n261.35billion as of March 2022 and $          \n241.93billion as of December 2021, and        \npayables to brokers, dealers and clearing     \norganizations of $ 31.63billion as of March   \n2022 and $ 10.00billion as of December 2021.  \nSuch payables primarily consist of customer   \ncredit balances related to the firm\u2019s prime   \nbrokerage activities. Customer and other      \npayables are accounted for at cost plus       \naccrued interest, which generally approximates\nfair value. As these payables are not         \naccounted for at fair value, they are not     \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 through 10. Had these payables been   \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,  \nsubstantially all would have been classified  \nin level 2 as of both March 2022 and December \n2021. Interest on customer and other payables \nis recognized over the life of the transaction\nand included in interest expense. Offsetting  \nAssets and Liabilities To reduce credit       \nexposures on derivatives and securities       \nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter    \ninto master netting agreements or similar     \narrangements (collectively, netting           \nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a      \ncontract with a counterparty that permits net \nsettlement of multiple transactions with that \ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of  \ntermination rights by a non-defaultingparty.  \nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all \ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is \ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with     \nrespect to its derivatives and securities     \nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms  \nof the related credit support agreements or   \nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit    \nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit    \nsupport agreement grants the non-             \ndefaultingparty exercising termination rights \nthe right to liquidate the collateral and     \napply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In    \norder to assess enforceability of the firm\u2019s  \nright of setoff under netting and credit      \nsupport agreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in   \nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the        \nagreement.                                    \n                                           \n  9    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and         \nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not       \nreported net of the related cash and          \nsecurities received or posted as collateral.  \nSee Note 11 for further information about     \ncollateral received and pledged, including    \nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See \nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about  \noffsetting assets and liabilities. Share-Based\nCompensation The cost of employee services    \nreceived in exchange for a share-based award  \nis generally measured based on the grant-date \nfair value of the award. Share-based awards   \nthat do not require future service (i.e.,     \nvested awards, including awards granted to    \nretirement-eligible employees) are expensed   \nimmediately. Share-based awards that require  \nfuture service are amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recorded when \nthey occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on \nrestricted stock units (RSUs) are generally   \ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that    \nrequire future service are forfeited, the     \nrelated dividend equivalents originally       \ncharged to retained earnings are reclassified \nto compensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues  \nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of   \nshare-based awards. In certain cases,         \nprimarily related to conflicted employment (as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements), \nthe firm may cash settle share-based          \ncompensation awards accounted for as equity   \ninstruments. For these awards, whose terms    \nallow for cash settlement, additional paid-in \ncapital is adjusted to the extent of the      \ndifference between the value of the award at  \nthe time of cash settlement and the grant-date\nvalue of the award. The tax effect related to \nthe settlement of share-based awards is       \nrecorded in income tax benefit or expense.    \nForeign Currency Translation Assets and       \nliabilities denominated in non-U.S.currencies \nare translated at rates of exchange prevailing\non the date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at   \naverage rates of exchange for the period.     \nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies   \nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a  \nnon-U.S.operation, when the functional        \ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are   \nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the     \nconsolidated statements of comprehensive      \nincome.

Fair Value Measurements   \nThe fair value of a financial instrument is   \nthe amount that would be received to sell an  \nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an   \norderly transaction between market            \nparticipants at the measurement date.         \nFinancial assets are marked to bid prices and \nfinancial liabilities are marked to offer     \nprices. Fair value measurements do not include\ntransaction costs. The firm measures certain  \nfinancial assets and liabilities as a         \nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to \nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active  \nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by    \nreference to prices for similar instruments,  \nquoted prices or recent transactions in less  \nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or            \nindependently sourced inputs, including, but  \nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities, \nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding  \nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference       \nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower \ncould finance a given financial instrument    \nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.  \nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for          \ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This   \nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation \ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving \nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based \non the lowest level of input that is          \nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In \nevaluating the significance of a valuation    \ninput, the firm considers, among other        \nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to   \nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as    \nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical, \nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.  \nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are       \nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values \nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial \nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain  \nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and      \nliabilities may require valuation adjustments \nthat a market participant would require to    \narrive at fair value for factors, such as     \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,   \nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments  \nare generally based on market evidence. The   \nvaluation techniques and nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair value of the\nfirm\u2019s financialinstruments are described     \nbelow. See Notes 5 through 10 for further     \ninformation about significant unobservable    \ninputs used to value level 3 financial        \ninstruments. Valuation Techniques and         \nSignificant Inputs for Trading Cash           \nInstruments, Investments and Loans Level 1.   \nLevel 1 instruments include U.S. government   \nobligations, most non-U.S.government          \nobligations, certain agency obligations,      \ncertain corporate debt instruments, certain   \nmoney market instruments, certain other debt  \nobligations and actively traded listed        \nequities. These instruments are valued using  \nquoted prices for identical unrestricted      \ninstruments in active markets. The firm       \ndefines active markets for equity instruments \nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market  \ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm   \ndefines active markets for debt instruments   \nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity. \nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain  \nnon-U.S.government obligations, most agency   \nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and   \nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,  \nmost state and municipal obligations, most    \nmoney market instruments, most other debt     \nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed \nequities, certain private equities,           \ncommodities and certain lending commitments.  \nValuations of level 2 instruments can be      \nverified to quoted prices, recent trading     \nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative    \npricing sources with reasonable levels of     \nprice transparency. Consideration is given to \nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor executable) and the relationship of recent \nmarket activity to the prices provided from   \nalternative pricing sources. Valuation        \nadjustments are typically made to level 2     \ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject  \nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair   \nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally    \nbased on market evidence. Level 3. Level 3    \ninstruments have one or more significant      \nvaluation inputs that are not observable.     \nAbsent evidence to the contrary, level 3      \ninstruments are initially valued at           \ntransaction price, which is considered to be  \nthe best initial estimate of fair value.      \nSubsequently, the firm uses other             \nmethodologies to determine fair value, which  \nvary based on the type of instrument.         \nValuation inputs and assumptions are changed  \nwhen corroborated by substantive observable   \nevidence, including values realized on sales. \n                                            \n  11    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Interest    \n       rate swaps and options denominated in  \n       the currencies of leading              \n       industrialized nations are             \n  \u2022    characterized by high trading volumes  \n       and tight bid/offer spreads. Interest  \n       rate derivatives that reference        \n       indices, such as an inflation index,   \n       or the shape of the yield curve        \n       (e.g.,10-yearswap rate vs.2-yearswap   \n       rate) are more complex, but the key    \n       inputs are generally observable.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit.Price transparency for credit   \n       default swaps, including both single   \n       names and baskets of credits, varies   \n       by market and underlying reference     \n       entity or obligation. Credit default   \n       swaps that reference indices, large    \n       corporates and major sovereigns        \n       generally exhibit the most price       \n       transparency. For credit default       \n       swaps with other underliers, price     \n       transparency varies based on credit    \n       rating, the cost of borrowing the      \n       underlying reference obligations, and  \n  \u2022    the availability of the underlying     \n       reference obligations for delivery     \n       upon the default of the issuer.        \n       Credit default swaps that reference    \n       loans, asset-backed securities and     \n       emerging market debt instruments tend  \n       to have less price transparency than   \n       those that reference corporate bonds.  \n       In addition, more complex credit       \n       derivatives, such as those sensitive   \n       to the correlation between two or      \n       more underlying reference              \n       obligations, generally have less       \n       price transparency.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Currency.Prices for currency           \n       derivatives based on the exchange      \n       rates of leading industrialized        \n       nations, including those with longer   \n       tenors, are generally transparent.     \n  \u2022    The primary difference between the     \n       price transparency of developed and    \n       emerging market currency derivatives   \n       is that emerging markets tend to be    \n       only observable for contracts with     \n       shorter tenors.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Commodity.Commodity derivatives        \n       include transactions referenced to     \n       energy (e.g., oil, natural gas and     \n       electricity), metals (e.g., precious   \n       and base) and soft commodities (e.g.,  \n       agricultural). Price transparency      \n       varies based on the underlying         \n  \u2022    commodity, delivery location, tenor    \n       and product quality (e.g., diesel      \n       fuel compared to unleaded gasoline).   \n       In general, price transparency for     \n       commodity derivatives is greater for   \n       contracts with shorter tenors and      \n       contracts that are more closely        \n       aligned with major and/or benchmark    \n       commodity indices.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Equity.Price transparency for equity   \n       derivatives varies by market and       \n       underlier. Options on indices and the  \n       common stock of corporates included    \n       in major equity indices exhibit the    \n       most price transparency.

In addition,    \n  \u2022    the valuation of certain structured    \n       trades requires the use of level\u00a03     \n       correlation inputs, such as the        \n       correlation of the price performance   \n       of two or more individual stocks or    \n       the correlation of the price           \n       performance for a basket of stocks to  \n       another asset class, such as           \n       commodities.                           \n                                              \nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level\n3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and\nlevel 2 inputs to reflect observable market   \nchanges and any resulting gains and losses are\nclassified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are     \nchanged when corroborated by evidence, such as\nsimilar market transactions, third-party      \npricing services and/or broker or dealer      \nquotations or other empirical market data. In \ncircumstances where the firm cannot verify the\nmodel value by reference to market            \ntransactions, it is possible that a different \nvaluation model could produce a materially    \ndifferent estimate of fair value. See Note 7  \nfor further information about significant     \nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of  \nlevel 3 derivatives. Valuation Adjustments.   \nValuation adjustments are integral to         \ndetermining the fair value of derivative      \nportfolios and are used to adjust the mid-    \nmarketvaluations produced by derivative       \npricing models to the exit price valuation.   \nThese adjustments incorporate bid/offer       \nspreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and\nfunding valuation adjustments, which account  \nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in   \nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative    \nportfolios. The firm also makes funding       \nvaluation adjustments to collateralized       \nderivatives where the terms of the agreement  \ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge \ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are  \ngenerally used when calibrating valuation     \nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In     \naddition, for derivatives that include        \nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm     \nmakes model or exit price adjustments to      \naccount for the valuation uncertainty present \nin the transaction.                           \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    14  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Such instruments include   \nresale and repurchase agreements; certain     \nsecurities borrowed and loaned transactions;  \ncertain customer and other receivables,       \nincluding certain margin loans; certain time  \ndeposits, including structured certificates of\ndeposit, which are hybrid financial           \ninstruments; substantially all other secured  \nfinancings, including transfers of assets     \naccounted for as financings; certain unsecured\nshort- and long-term borrowings, substantially\nall of which are hybrid financial instruments;\nand certain other liabilities. These          \ninstruments are generally valued based on     \ndiscounted cash flow techniques, which        \nincorporate inputs with reasonable levels of  \nprice transparency, and are generally         \nclassified in level 2 because the inputs are  \nobservable.

The significant inputs to the     \nvaluation of resale and repurchase agreements \nand securities borrowed and loaned are funding\nspreads, the amount and timing of expected    \nfuture cash flows and interest rates. Customer\nand Other Receivables. The significant inputs \nto the valuation of receivables are interest  \nrates, the amount and timing of expected      \nfuture cash flows and funding spreads.        \nDeposits. The significant inputs to the       \nvaluation of time deposits are interest rates \nand the amount and timing of future cash      \nflows. The inputs used to value the embedded  \nderivative component of hybrid financial      \ninstruments are consistent with the inputs    \nused to value the firm\u2019s other derivative     \ninstruments described above. See Note 7 for   \nfurther information about derivatives and Note\n13 for further information about deposits.    \nOther Secured Financings. The significant     \ninputs to the valuation of other secured      \nfinancings are the amount and timing of       \nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,   \nfunding spreads and the fair value of the     \ncollateral delivered by the firm (determined  \nusing the amount and timing of expected future\ncash flows, market prices, market yields and  \nrecovery assumptions). See Note 11 for further\ninformation about other secured financings.   \nUnsecured Short- and\nLong-Term Borrowings.\nThe significant inputs\nto the valuation of\nunsecured short- and\nlong-term borrowings\nare the amount and\ntiming of expected\nfuture cash flows,\ninterest rates, the\ncredit spreads of the\nfirm and commodity\nprices for prepaid\ncommodity transactions.\nThe inputs used to\nvalue the embedded\nderivative component of\nhybrid financial\ninstruments are\nconsistent with the\ninputs used to value\nthe firm\u2019s other\nderivative instruments\ndescribed above.

For example,  \n       the highest recovery rate for          \n       corporate debt instruments is          \n  \u2022    appropriate for valuing a specific     \n       corporate debt instrument, but may     \n       not be appropriate for valuing any     \n       other corporate debt instrument.       \n       Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do   \n       not represent uncertainty in, or       \n       possible ranges of, fair value         \n       measurements of level\u00a03 trading cash   \n       instruments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increases in yield, duration or        \n       cumulative loss rate used in the       \n       valuation of level\u00a03 trading cash      \n       instruments would have resulted in a   \n       lower fair value measurement, while    \n       increases in recovery rate would have  \n  \u2022    resulted in a higher fair value        \n       measurement as of both March\u00a02022 and  \n       December\u00a02021. Due to the distinctive  \n       nature of each level\u00a03 trading cash    \n       instrument, the interrelationship of   \n       inputs is not necessarily uniform      \n       within each product type.              \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Trading cash instruments are valued    \n       using discounted cash flows.           \n                                              \nLevel 3 Rollforward                           \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level\u00a03\ntrading cash\ninstruments.\n                                              \n                     Three                    \n                    Months                    \n               Ended March                    \n  $ in\u00a0               2022           2021     \n  millions                                    \n  Total                                       \n  trading                                     \n  cash                                        \n  instrume\u2026                                   \n  assets                                      \n  Beginning         $1,889         $1,237     \n  balance                                     \n  Net                                         \n  realized              53             33     \n  gains/(l\u2026                                   \n  Net                                         \n  unrealiz\u2026         (1,485  )          33     \n  gains/(l\u2026                                   \n  Purchases            793            521     \n  Sales               (267  )        (307  )  \n  Settleme\u2026            (96  )        (153  )  \n  Transfers                                   \n  into               1,324            224     \n  level\u00a03                                     \n  Transfers                                   \n  out of              (290  )        (215  )  \n  level\u00a03                                     \n  Ending            $1,921         $1,373     \n  balance                                     \n  Total                                       \n  trading                                     \n  cash                                        \n  instrume\u2026                                   \n  liabilit\u2026                                   \n  Beginning          $(104  )    $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(80  )  \n  balance                                     \n  Net                                         \n  realized              (1  )           1     \n  gains/(l\u2026                                   \n  Net                                         \n  unrealiz\u2026             52             (2  )  \n  gains/(l\u2026                                   \n  Purchases            130             21     \n  Sales                (63  )         (40  )  \n  Settleme\u2026              2              7     \n  Transfers                                   \n  into                (124  )         (19  )  \n  level\u00a03                                     \n  Transfers                                   \n  out of                16              6     \n  level\u00a03                                     \n  Ending              $(92  )     $\u00a0\u00a0(106  )  \n  balance                                     \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       Changes in fair value are presented    \n  \u2022    for all trading cash instruments that  \n       are classified in level\u00a03 as of the    \n       end of the period.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates  \n  \u2022    to trading cash instruments that were  \n       still held atperiod-end.               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Transfers between levels of the fair   \n       value hierarchy are reported at the    \n       beginning of the reporting period in   \n  \u2022    which they occur.

Note 7.   \nDerivatives and Hedging Activities Derivative \nActivities Derivatives are instruments that   \nderive their value from underlying asset      \nprices, indices, reference rates and other    \ninputs, or a combination of these factors.    \nDerivatives may be traded on an exchange      \n(exchange-traded) or they may be privately    \nnegotiated contracts, which are usually       \nreferred to as OTC derivatives. Certain of the\nfirm\u2019s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled\nthrough central clearing counterparties (OTC- \ncleared),while others are bilateral contracts \nbetween two counterparties (bilateral OTC).   \n                                            \n  19    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

As a\nmarket maker, the firm\nenters into derivative\ntransactions to\nprovide liquidity to\nclients and to\nfacilitate the\ntransfer and hedging\nof their risks. In\nthis role, the firm\ntypically acts as\nprincipal and is\nrequired to commit\ncapital to provide\nexecution, and\nmaintains market-\nmaking positions in\nresponse to, or in\nanticipation of,\nclient demand.\n\nRisk Management. The\nfirm also enters into\nderivatives to\nactively manage risk\nexposures that arise\nfrom its market-making\nand investing and\nfinancing activities.\nThe firm\u2019s holdings\nand exposures are\nhedged, in many cases,\non either a portfolio\nor risk-specific\nbasis, as opposed to\nan instrument-by-\ninstrumentbasis. The\noffsetting impact of\nthis economic hedging\nis reflected in the\nsame business segment\nas the related\nrevenues. In addition,\nthe firm may enter\ninto derivatives\ndesignated as hedges\nunder U.S. GAAP. These\nderivatives are used\nto manage interest\nrate exposure of\ncertain fixed-rate\nunsecured borrowings\nand deposits, foreign\nexchange risk of\ncertain available-for-\nsalesecurities and the\nnet investment in\ncertain\nnon-U.S.operations,\nand the price risk of\ncertain commodities.\n\nThe firm enters into\nvarious types of\nderivatives,\nincluding:\n                                              \n       Futures and Forwards.Contracts that    \n       commit counterparties to purchase or   \n  \u2022    sell financial instruments,            \n       commodities or currencies in the       \n       future.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Swaps.Contracts that require           \n       counterparties to exchange cash        \n       flows, such as currency or interest    \n       payment streams. The amounts           \n  \u2022    exchanged are based on the specific    \n       terms of the contract with reference   \n       to specified rates, financial          \n       instruments, commodities, currencies   \n       or indices.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Options.Contracts in which the option  \n       purchaser has the right, but not the   \n       obligation, to purchase from or sell   \n  \u2022    to the option writer financial         \n       instruments, commodities or            \n       currencies within a defined time       \n       period for a specified price.          \n                                              \nDerivatives are\nreported on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for\nderivative assets and\nliabilities for a\ngiven counterparty)\nwhen a legal right of\nsetoff exists under an\nenforceable netting\nagreement\n(counterparty\nnetting).

An average      \n       greater than the median indicates      \n  \u2022    that the majority of inputs are below  \n       the average. For example, the          \n       difference between the average and     \n       the median for credit spreads          \n       indicates that the majority of the     \n       inputs fall in the lower end of the    \n       range.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       The ranges, averages and medians of    \n       these inputs are not representative    \n       of the appropriate inputs to use when  \n       calculating the fair value of any one  \n       derivative. For example, the highest   \n       correlation for interest rate          \n       derivatives is appropriate for         \n  \u2022    valuing a specific interest rate       \n       derivative but may not be appropriate  \n       for valuing any other interest rate    \n       derivative. Accordingly, the ranges    \n       of inputs do not represent             \n       uncertainty in, or possible ranges     \n       of, fair value measurements of level\u00a0  \n       3 derivatives.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Interest rates, currencies and         \n       equities derivatives are valued using  \n       option pricing models, credit          \n       derivatives are valued using option    \n  \u2022    pricing, correlation and discounted    \n       cash flow models, and commodities      \n       derivatives are valued using option    \n       pricing and discounted cash flow       \n       models.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       The fair value of any one instrument   \n       may be determined using multiple       \n       valuation techniques.

Transfers into   \nlevel 3 derivatives during the three months   \nended March 2022 reflected transfers of       \ncertain equity derivative liabilities from    \nlevel 2 (principally due to certain           \nunobservable volatility inputs becoming       \nsignificant to the valuation of these         \nderivatives). Transfers out of level 3        \nderivatives during the three months ended     \nMarch 2022 primarily reflected transfers of   \ncertain interest rate derivative assets to    \nlevel 2 (principally due to increased         \ntransparency of certain unobservable inputs   \nused to value these derivatives) and certain  \ncommodity derivative assets to level 2        \n(principally due to certain volatility inputs \nno longer being significant to the valuation  \nof these derivatives), partially offset by    \ntransfers of certain equity derivative        \nliabilities to level 2 (principally due to    \nincreased transparency of certain volatility  \nand correlation inputs used to value these    \nderivatives). Three Months Ended March 2021.  \nThe net realized and unrealized losses on     \nlevel 3 derivatives of $ 58million (reflecting\n$ 98million of net realized losses and $      \n40million of net unrealized gains) for the    \nthree months ended March 2021 included losses \nof $ 57million reported in market making and  \nlosses of $ 1million reported in other        \nprincipal transactions. The net unrealized    \ngains on level 3 derivatives for the three    \nmonths ended March 2021 were primarily        \nattributable to gains on certain interest rate\nderivatives (primarily reflecting the impact  \nof an increase in interest rates) and gains on\ncertain credit derivatives (primarily         \nreflecting the impact of a widening of certain\ncredit spreads, changes in foreign exchange   \nrates and an increase in interest rates)      \npartially offset by losses on certain equity  \nderivatives (primarily reflecting the impact  \nof an increase in equity prices). The drivers \nof transfers into level 3 derivatives during  \nthe three months ended March 2021 were not    \nmaterial.

Credit\nderivatives are\nactively managed based\non the firm\u2019s net risk\nposition. Credit\nderivatives are\ngenerally individually\nnegotiated contracts\nand can have various\nsettlement and payment\nconventions. Credit\nevents include failure\nto pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of\nindebtedness,\nrestructuring,\nrepudiation and\ndissolution of the\nreference entity.\n\nThe firm enters into\nthe following types of\ncredit derivatives:\n                                              \n       Credit Default Swaps.Single-name       \n       credit default swaps protect the       \n       buyer against the loss of principal    \n       on one or more bonds, loans or         \n       mortgages (reference obligations) in   \n       the event the issuer of the reference  \n       obligations suffers a credit event.    \n       The buyer of protection pays an        \n       initial or periodic premium to the     \n  \u2022    seller and receives protection for     \n       the period of the contract. If there   \n       is no credit event, as defined in the  \n       contract, the seller of protection     \n       makes no payments to the buyer. If a   \n       credit event occurs, the seller of     \n       protection is required to make a       \n       payment to the buyer, calculated       \n       according to the terms of the          \n       contract.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit Options.In a credit option,     \n       the option writer assumes the          \n       obligation to purchase or sell a       \n       reference obligation at a specified    \n       price or credit spread. The option     \n       purchaser buys the right, but does     \n  \u2022    not assume the obligation, to sell     \n       the reference obligation to, or        \n       purchase it from, the option writer.   \n       The payments on credit options depend  \n       either on a particular credit spread   \n       or the price of the reference          \n       obligation.                            \n                                              \n                                            \n  25    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited)                                   \n                                              \n       Credit Indices, Baskets and            \n       Tranches.Credit derivatives may        \n       reference a basket of single-name      \n       credit default swaps or a broad-based  \n       index. If a credit event occurs in     \n       one of the underlying reference        \n       obligations, the protection seller     \n       pays the protection buyer. The         \n       payment is typically apro-rataportion  \n       of the transaction\u2019s total notional    \n  \u2022    amount based on the underlying         \n       defaulted reference obligation. In     \n       certain transactions, the credit risk  \n       of a basket or index is separated      \n       into various portions (tranches),      \n       each having different levels of        \n       subordination. The most junior         \n       tranches cover initial defaults and    \n       once losses exceed the notional        \n       amount of these junior tranches, any   \n       excess loss is covered by the next     \n       most senior tranche.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Total Return Swaps.A total return      \n       swap transfers the risks relating to   \n       economic performance of a reference    \n       obligation from the protection buyer   \n       to the protection seller. Typically,   \n       the protection buyer receives a        \n  \u2022    floating rate of interest and          \n       protection against any reduction in    \n       fair value of the reference            \n       obligation, and the protection seller  \n       receives the cash flows associated     \n       with the reference obligation, plus    \n       any increase in the fair value of the  \n       reference obligation.                  \n                                              \nThe firm economically\nhedges its exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a\nparticular written\ncredit derivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default.\n\nAs of March\u00a02022,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $ 624.62\nbillion and purchased\ncredit derivatives had\na total gross notional\namount of $ 686.11\nbillion, for total net\nnotional purchased\nprotection of $ 61.49\nbillion.

The            \neffectiveness of such hedges is assessed based\non changes in spot rates.

During\nthe second quarter of 2021, the firm          \ndesignated commodity futures contracts as fair\nvalue hedges of the price risk of certain     \nprecious metals included in commodities within\ntrading assets. As of March 2022, the carrying\nvalue of such commodities was $ 125million and\nthe amortized cost was $ 126million, and as of\nDecember 2021, the carrying value was $       \n1.05billion and the amortized cost was $      \n1.02billion. Changes in spot rates of such    \ncommodities are reflected as an adjustment to \ntheir carrying value, and the related         \ngains/(losses) on both the commodities and the\ndesignated futures contracts are included in  \nmarket making.

Credit\nfunds generally invest in loans and other     \nfixed income instruments and are focused on   \nproviding private high-yield capital for      \nleveraged and management buyout transactions, \nrecapitalizations, financings, refinancings,  \nacquisitions and restructurings for private   \nequity firms, private family companies and    \ncorporate issuers. Real estate funds invest   \nglobally, primarily in real estate companies, \nloan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and   \nproperty. Private equity, credit and real     \nestate funds are closed-endfunds in which the \nfirm\u2019s investments are generally not eligible \nfor redemption. Distributions will be received\nfrom these funds as the underlying assets are \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. The firm also invests in hedge  \nfunds, primarily multi-disciplinary hedge     \nfunds that employ a fundamental bottom-       \nupinvestment approach across various asset    \nclasses and strategies. The firm\u2019s investments\nin hedge funds primarily include interests    \nwhere the underlying assets are illiquid in   \nnature, and proceeds from redemptions will not\nbe received until the underlying assets are   \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. Private equity and hedge funds, \nin which the firm is invested, include        \n\u201ccovered funds\u201d as defined in the Volcker Rule\nof the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).     \nSubstantially all of the credit and real      \nestate funds, in which the firm is invested,  \nare not covered funds. The Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve System (FRB) extended  \nthe conformance period to July 2022 for the   \nfirm\u2019s investments in, and relationships with,\ncertain legacy \u201cilliquid funds\u201d (as defined in\nthe Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to \nDecember 2013. This extension is applicable to\nsubstantially all of the firm\u2019s remaining     \ninvestments in, and relationships with, such  \ncovered funds. As of March 2022, the firm\u2019s   \ntotal investments in funds at NAV of $        \n3.24billion included $ 229million of          \ninvestments in covered funds for which        \ncompliance with the Volcker Rule will need to \nbe achieved by July 2022. The firm expects to \nachieve compliance for these covered funds    \nprimarily through restructuring them as       \nliquidating trusts prior to the conformance   \ndate. To the extent that the firm is not able \nto achieve compliance, the firm will be       \nrequired to sell its interests in such funds  \nby July 2022.

A loan is\nconsidered past due\nwhen a principal or\ninterest payment has\nnot been made according\nto its contractual\nterms.

To determine the \nallowance for credit losses, the firm         \nclassifies its loans and lending commitments  \naccounted for at amortized cost into wholesale\nand consumer portfolios. These portfolios     \nrepresent the level at which the firm has     \ndeveloped and documented its methodology to   \ndetermine the allowance for credit losses. The\nallowance for credit losses is measured on a  \ncollective basis for loans that exhibit       \nsimilar risk characteristics using a modeled  \napproach and asset-specific basis for loans   \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics. The allowance for credit     \nlosses takes into account the weighted average\nof a range of forecasts of future economic    \nconditions over the expected life of the loan \nand lending commitments. The expected life of \neach loan or lending commitment is determined \nbased on the contractual term adjusted for    \nextension options or demand features, or is   \nmodeled in the case of revolving credit card  \nloans. The forecasts include baseline,        \nfavorable and adverse economic scenarios over \na three-year period. For loans with expected  \nlives beyond three years, the model reverts to\nhistorical loss information based on a non-   \nlinearmodeled approach. The forecasted        \neconomic scenarios consider a number of risk  \nfactors relevant to the wholesale and consumer\nportfolios described below.

The firm\ngenerally calculates\nthe fair value of\nloans and lending\ncommitments for which\nthe fair value option\nis elected by\ndiscounting future\ncash flows at a rate\nwhich incorporates the\ninstrument-specific\ncredit spreads. For\nfloating-rate loans\nand lending\ncommitments,\nsubstantially all\nchanges in fair value\nare attributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads, whereas for\nfixed-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nchanges in fair value\nare also attributable\nto changes in interest\nrates.\nNote 11. Collateralized Agreements and        \nFinancings Collateralized agreements are      \nresale agreements and securities borrowed.    \nCollateralized financings are repurchase      \nagreements, securities loaned and other       \nsecured financings. The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things, \nfacilitate client activities, invest excess   \ncash, acquire securities to cover short       \npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings are  \npresented on a net-by-counterpartybasis when a\nlegal right of setoff exists. Interest on     \ncollateralized agreements, which is included  \nin interest income, and collateralized        \nfinancings, which is included in interest     \nexpense, is recognized over the life of the   \ntransaction. See Note 23 for further          \ninformation about interest income and interest\nexpense. Resale and Repurchase Agreements A   \nresale agreement is a transaction in which the\nfirm purchases financial instruments from a   \nseller, typically in exchange for cash, and   \nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to    \nresell the same or substantially the same     \nfinancial instruments to the seller at a      \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. A repurchase agreement is a transaction \nin which the firm sells financial instruments \nto a buyer, typically in exchange for cash,   \nand simultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same \nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a     \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale       \nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d)involve the legal transfer of       \nownership of financial instruments, they are  \naccounted for as financing arrangements       \nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the  \nmaturity of the agreement. The financial      \ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and   \nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.  \ngovernment and agency, and investment-grade   \nsovereign obligations. The firm receives      \nfinancial instruments purchased under resale  \nagreements and makes delivery of financial    \ninstruments sold under repurchase agreements. \nTo mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these financial           \ninstruments on a daily basis, and delivers or \nobtains additional collateral due to changes  \nin the market value of the financial          \ninstruments, as appropriate. For resale       \nagreements, the firm typically requires       \ncollateral with a fair value approximately    \nequal to the carrying value of the relevant   \nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.    \n                                            \n  49    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

The remainder is  \nheld by investment entities, including VIEs,  \nconsolidated by the firm. Substantially all   \nproperty and equipment is depreciated on a    \nstraight-line basis over the useful life of   \nthe asset.

Capitalized costs of\nsoftware developed or obtained for internal   \nuse are amortized on a straight-line basis    \nover three years. The firm tests property,    \nleasehold improvements and equipment for      \nimpairment when events or changes in          \ncircumstances suggest that an asset\u2019s or asset\ngroup\u2019s carrying value may not be fully       \nrecoverable. To the extent the carrying value \nof an asset or asset group exceeds the        \nprojected undiscounted cash flows expected to \nresult from the use and eventual disposal of  \nthe asset or asset group, the firm determines \nthe asset or asset group is impaired and      \nrecords an impairment equal to the difference \nbetween the estimated fair value and the      \ncarrying value of the asset or asset group. In\naddition, the firm will recognize an          \nimpairment prior to the sale of an asset or   \nasset group if the carrying value of the asset\nor asset group exceeds its estimated fair     \nvalue.

If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative assessment.\n\nThe quantitative\ngoodwill test compares\nthe estimated fair\nvalue of each reporting\nunit with its estimated\nnet book value\n(including goodwill and\nidentifiable intangible\nassets). If the\nreporting unit\u2019s\nestimated fair value\nexceeds its estimated\nnet book value,\ngoodwill is not\nimpaired. An impairment\nis recognized if the\nestimated fair value of\na reporting unit is\nless than its estimated\nnet book value.\n\nTo estimate the fair\nvalue of each reporting\nunit, other than\nConsumer banking, a\nrelative value\ntechnique is used\nbecause the firm\nbelieves market\nparticipants would use\nthis technique to value\nthese reporting units.\nThe relative value\ntechnique applies\nobservable price-to-\nearnings multiples or\nprice-to-book multiples\nof comparable\ncompetitors to\nreporting units\u2019 net\nearnings or net book\nvalue. To estimate the\nfair value of Consumer\nbanking, a discounted\ncash flow valuation\napproach is used\nbecause the firm\nbelieves market\nparticipants would use\nthis technique to value\nthat reporting unit\ngiven its early stage\nof development. The\nestimated net carrying\nvalue of each reporting\nunit reflects an\nallocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nand represents the\nestimated amount of\ntotal shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\n\nIn the fourth quarter\nof 2021, the firm\nperformed its annual\nassessment of goodwill\nfor impairment, for\neach of its reporting\nunits, by performing a\nqualitative assessment.\nMultiple factors,\nincluding performance\nindicators,\nmacroeconomic\nindicators, firm and\nindustry events, and\nfair value indicators,\nwere assessed with\nrespect to each of the\nfirm\u2019s reporting units\nto determine whether it\nwas more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of any of\nthose reporting units\nwas less than its\nestimated carrying\nvalue. The qualitative\nassessment also\nconsidered changes\nsince a quantitative\ntest was last performed\nin 2019.\n\nAs a result of the\nqualitative assessment,\nthe firm determined\nthat it was more likely\nthan not that the\nestimated fair value of\neach reporting unit\nexceeded its respective\nestimated carrying\nvalue. Therefore, the\nfirm determined that\ngoodwill for each\nreporting unit was not\nimpaired and that a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest was not required.\n\nThere were no events or\nchanges in\ncircumstances during\nthe three months ended\nMarch\u00a02022 that would\nindicate that it was\nmore likely than not\nthat the estimated fair\nvalue of each of the\nreporting units did not\nexceed its respective\nestimated carrying\nvalue as of March\u00a02022.\nIdentifiable Intangible                       \nAssets                                        \nThe table below\npresents identifiable\nintangible assets by\nreporting unit and\ntype.\n                                              \n                       As of                  \n  $ in\u00a0              March2\u2026       Decem\u2026     \n  milli\u2026                             2021     \n  By                                          \n  Repor\u2026                                      \n  Unit                                        \n  Global                                      \n  Marke\u2026                                      \n  FICC                     $            $     \n                           1            1     \n  Equit\u2026                  42           43     \n  Asset                  114          122     \n  Manag\u2026                                      \n          Consum\u2026                             \n          &                                   \n          Wealth                              \n          Manage\u2026                             \n  Consu\u2026                 810            \u2013     \n  banki\u2026                                      \n  Wealth                 242          252     \n  manag\u2026                                      \n  Total                    $            $     \n                       1,209          418     \n  By                                          \n  Type                                        \n  Custo\u2026                                      \n  lists                                       \n  and                                         \n  merch\u2026                                      \n  relat\u2026                                      \n  Gross                    $            $     \n  carry\u2026               2,270        1,460     \n  value                                       \n  Accum\u2026              (1,142  )    (1,130  )  \n  amort\u2026                                      \n  Net                                         \n  carry\u2026               1,128          330     \n  value                                       \n  Acqui\u2026                                      \n  leases                                      \n  and                                         \n  other                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  carry\u2026                 494          500     \n  value                                       \n  Accum\u2026                (413  )      (412  )  \n  amort\u2026                                      \n  Net                                         \n  carry\u2026                  81           88     \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  gross                2,764        1,960     \n  carry\u2026                                      \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  accum\u2026              (1,555  )    (1,542  )  \n  amort\u2026                                      \n  Total                                       \n  net                      $            $     \n  carry\u2026               1,209          418     \n  value                                       \n                                              \nThe firm acquired\napproximately $ 817\nmillion of identifia b\nle intangible assets\n(with a weighted\naverage amortization\nperiod of 12 years)\nduring the three months\nended March\u00a02022,\nsubstantially all\nrelated to GreenSky\u2019s\nmerchant relationships.\nDuring 2021, the amount\nof identifia b le\nintangible assets\nacquired by the firm\nwas no t material.\n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    54  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In\naddition, the firm\nwill recognize an\nimpairment prior to\nthe sale of an asset\nor asset group if the\ncarrying value of the\nasset or asset group\nexceeds its estimated\nfair value.

For leases\nlonger than one year,\nthe firm recognizes a\nright-of-use asset\nrepresenting the right\nto use the underlying\nasset for the lease\nterm, and a lease\nliability representing\nthe liability to make\npayments. The lease\nterm is generally\ndetermined based on the\ncontractual maturity of\nthe lease. For leases\nwhere the firm has the\noption to terminate or\nextend the lease, an\nassessment of the\nlikelihood of\nexercising the option\nis incorporated into\nthe determination of\nthe lease term. Such\nassessment is initially\nperformed at the\ninception of the lease\nand is updated if\nevents occur that\nimpact the original\nassessment.\n\nAn operating lease\nright-of-use asset is\ninitially determined\nbased on the operating\nlease liability,\nadjusted for initial\ndirect costs, lease\nincentives and amounts\npaid at or prior to\nlease commencement.\nThis amount is then\namortized over the\nlease term. The firm\nrecognized $ 67 million\nfor the three months\nended March\u00a02022 and $\n108 million for the\nthree months ended\nMarch\u00a02021 of right-of-\nuse assets and\noperating lease\nliabilities in non-cash\ntransactions for leases\nentered into or\nassumed.

The Trust issued $  \n2.75billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial\ninterests (Trust Preferred securities) to     \nthird parties and $ 85million of common       \nbeneficial interests to Group Inc. As of both \nMarch 2022 and December 2021, the outstanding \npar amount of junior subordinated debt held by\nthe Trust was $ 968million and the outstanding\npar amount of Trust Preferred securities and  \ncommon beneficial interests issued by the     \nTrust was $ 939million and $ 29million,       \nrespectively. The Trust is a wholly-owned     \nfinance subsidiary of the firm for regulatory \nand legal purposes but is not consolidated for\naccounting purposes. The firm pays interest   \nsemi-annually on the junior subordinated debt \nat an annual rate of 6.345% and the debt      \nmatures on February 15, 2034. The coupon rate \nand the payment dates applicable to the       \nbeneficial interests are the same as the      \ninterest rate and payment dates for the junior\nsubordinated debt. The firm has the right,    \nfrom time to time, to defer payment of        \ninterest on the junior subordinated debt, and \ntherefore cause payment on the Trust\u2019s        \npreferred beneficial interests to be deferred,\nin each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual\nperiods. During any such deferral period, the \nfirm will not be permitted to, among other    \nthings, pay dividends on or make certain      \nrepurchases of its common stock. The Trust is \nnot permitted to pay any distributions on the \ncommon beneficial interests held by Group Inc.\nunless all dividends payable on the preferred \nbeneficial interests have been paid in full.  \nThe firm has covenanted in favor of the       \nholders of Group Inc.\u2019s 6.345% junior         \nsubordinated debt due February 15, 2034, that,\nsubject to certain exceptions, the firm will  \nnot redeem or purchase the capital securities \nissued by Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman\nSachs Capital III (APEX Trusts) or shares of  \nGroup Inc.\u2019s Perpetual Non-CumulativePreferred\nStock, Series E (Series E Preferred Stock),   \nPerpetual Non-CumulativePreferred Stock,      \nSeries F (Series F Preferred Stock) or        \nPerpetual Non-CumulativePreferred Stock,      \nSeries O (Series O Preferred Stock), if the   \nredemption or purchase results in less than $ \n253million aggregate liquidation preference of\nthat series outstanding, prior to June 1, 2022\nfor Series E Preferred Stock and September 4, \n2022 for both Series F Preferred Stock and    \nSeries O Preferred Stock, for a price that    \nexceeds a maximum amount determined by        \nreference to the net cash proceeds that the   \nfirm has received from the sale of qualifying \nsecurities.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) The firm reassesses its evaluation\nof whether an entity is a VIE when certain    \nreconsideration events occur. The firm        \nreassesses its determination of whether it is \nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and              \ncircumstances. VIE Activities The firm is     \nprincipally involved with VIEs through the    \nfollowing business activities: Mortgage-Backed\nVIEs. The firm sells residential and          \ncommercial mortgage loans and securities to   \nmortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial\ninterests in the assets sold to these VIEs.   \nThe firm purchases and sells beneficial       \ninterests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in   \nconnection with market-making activities. In  \naddition, the firm may enter into derivatives \nwith certain of these VIEs, primarily interest\nrate swaps, which are typically not variable  \ninterests. The firm generally enters into     \nderivatives with other counterparties to      \nmitigate its risk. Real Estate, Credit- and   \nPower-Related and Other Investing VIEs. The   \nfirm purchases equity and debt securities     \nissued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold   \nreal estate, performing and nonperforming     \ndebt, distressed loans, power-related assets  \nand equity securities. The firm generally does\nnot sell assets to, or enter into derivatives \nwith, these VIEs. Corporate Debt and Other    \nAsset-Backed VIEs. The firm structures VIEs   \nthat issue notes to clients, purchases and    \nsells beneficial interests issued by corporate\ndebt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection\nwith market-making activities, and makes loans\nto VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain\nof these VIEs synthetically create the        \nexposure for the beneficial interests they    \nissue by entering into credit derivatives with\nthe firm, rather than purchasing the          \nunderlying assets. In addition, the firm may  \nenter into derivatives, such as total return  \nswaps, with certain corporate debt and other  \nasset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays  \nthe VIE a return due to the beneficial        \ninterest holders and receives the return on   \nthe collateral owned by the VIE. The          \ncollateral owned by these VIEs is primarily   \nother asset-backed loans and securities. The  \nfirm may be removed as the total return swap  \ncounterparty and may enter into derivatives   \nwith other counterparties to mitigate its risk\nrelated to these swaps. The firm may sell     \nassets to the corporate debt and other asset- \nbacked VIEs it structures.                    \nPrincipal-Protected\nNote VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs own\nportfolios of assets,\nprincipally with\nexposure to hedge\nfunds. Substantially\nall of the principal\nprotection on the notes\nissued by these VIEs is\nprovided by the asset\nportfolio rebalancing\nthat is required under\nthe terms of the notes.\nThe firm enters into\ntotal return swaps with\nthese VIEs under which\nthe firm pays the VIE\nthe return due to the\nprincipal-protected\nnote holders and\nreceives the return on\nthe assets owned by the\nVIE. The firm may enter\ninto derivatives with\nother counterparties to\nmitigate its risk. The\nfirm also obtains\nfunding through these\nVIEs.\n\nInvestments in Funds.\nThe firm makes equity\ninvestments in certain\ninvestment fund VIEs it\nmanages and is entitled\nto receive fees from\nthese VIEs. The firm\nhas generally not sold\nassets to, or entered\ninto derivatives with,\nthese VIEs.\nNonconsolidated VIEs                          \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe nonconsolidated\nVIEs in which the firm\nholds variable\ninterests.\n                                              \n                        As of                 \n  $ in\u00a0millions         March           2021  \n                         2022                 \n  Total                                       \n  nonconsolidated                             \n  VIEs                                        \n  Assets in VIEs     $176,567       $176,809  \n  Carrying value                              \n  of variable         $10,620     $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09,582  \n  interests \u2014                                 \n  assets                                      \n  Carrying value                              \n  of variable               $    $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0928  \n  interests \u2014             756                 \n  liabilities                                 \n  Maximum                                     \n  exposure to                                 \n  loss:                                       \n  Retained                  $     $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03,552  \n  interests             4,401                 \n  Purchased               646          1,071  \n  interests                                   \n  Commitments and       2,640          2,440  \n  guarantees                                  \n  Derivatives           8,588          8,682  \n  Debt and equity       5,270          4,639  \n  Total               $21,545      $\u00a0\u00a020,384  \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       The nature of the firm\u2019s variable      \n  \u2022    interests is described in the rows     \n       under maximum exposure to loss.        \n                                              \n                                              \n       The firm\u2019s exposure to the             \n       obligations of VIEs is generally       \n       limited to its interests in these      \n  \u2022    entities.

See the tables in         \n       \u201cCommitments\u201d above for a summary of   \n       the firm\u2019s commitments.                \n                                              \n                                              \n       The carrying value for derivatives     \n       included derivative assets of          \n       $1.56billion as of March\u00a02022 and      \n  \u2022    $1.10billion as of December\u00a02021, and  \n       derivative liabilities of              \n       $5.49billion as of March\u00a02022 and      \n       $4.51billion as of December\u00a02021.      \n                                              \nDerivative Guarantees. The firm enters into   \nvarious derivatives that meet the definition  \nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including     \nwritten equity and commodity put options,     \nwritten currency contracts and interest rate  \ncaps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives \nare risk managed together with derivatives    \nthat do not meet the definition of a          \nguarantee, and therefore the amounts in the   \ntable above do not reflect the firm\u2019s overall \nrisk related to derivative activities.        \nDisclosures about derivatives are not required\nif they may be cash settled and the firm has  \nno basis to conclude it is probable that the  \ncounterparties held the underlying instruments\nat inception of the contract. The firm has    \nconcluded that these conditions have been met \nfor certain large, internationally active     \ncommercial and investment bank counterparties,\ncentral clearing counterparties, hedge funds  \nand certain other counterparties. Accordingly,\nthe firm has not included such contracts in   \nthe table above. See Note 7 for information   \nabout credit derivatives that meet the        \ndefinition of a guarantee, which are not      \nincluded in the table above. De rivatives are \naccounted for at fair value and therefore the \ncarrying value is considered the best         \nindication of payment/performance risk for    \nindividual contracts. However, the carrying   \nvalues in the table above exclude the effect  \nof counterparty and cash collateral netting.  \nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees.   \nSecurities lending and clearing guarantees    \ninclude the indemnifications and guarantees   \nthat the firm provides in its capacity as an  \nagency lender and in its capacity as a        \nsponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. As an agency lender, the firm    \nindemnifies most of its securities lending    \ncustomers against losses incurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not return securities and   \nthe collateral held is insufficient to cover  \nthe market value of the securities borrowed.  \nThe maximum payout of such indemnifications   \nwas $ 14.68billion as of March 2022 and $     \n11.05billion as of December 2021. Collateral  \nheld by the lenders in connection with        \nsecurities lending indemnifications was $     \n15.23billion as of March 2022 and $           \n11.36billion as of December 2021. Because the \ncontractual nature of these arrangements      \nrequires the firm to obtain collateral with a \nmarket value that exceeds the value of the    \nsecurities lent to the borrower, there is     \nminimal performance risk associated with these\nindemnifications.                             \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    66  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) As a sponsoring member of the     \nGovernment Securities Division of the Fixed   \nIncome Clearing Corporation, the firm         \nguarantees the performance of its sponsored   \nmember clients to the Fixed Income Clearing   \nCorporation in connection with certain resale \nand repurchase agreements. To minimize        \npotential losses on such guarantees, the firm \nobtains a security interest in the collateral \nthat the sponsored client placed with the     \nFixed Income Clearing Corporation. Therefore, \nthe risk of loss on such guarantees is        \nminimal. There were no amounts outstanding    \nunder the guarantee as of both March 2022 and \nDecember 2021. Other Financial Guarantees. In \nthe ordinary course of business, the firm     \nprovides other financial guarantees of the    \nobligations of third parties (e.g., standby   \nletters of credit and other guarantees to     \nenable clients to complete transactions and   \nfund-related guarantees). These guarantees    \nrepresent obligations to make payments to     \nbeneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to\nfulfill its obligation under a contractual    \narrangement with that beneficiary. Other      \nfinancial guarantees also include a guarantee \nthat the firm has provided to the Government  \nof Malaysia that it will receive at least $   \n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets \nseized by governmental authorities around the \nworld related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad,\na sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB).   \nThe firm evaluates progress toward satisfying \nthis obligation based on the report that it   \nreceives on a semi-annual basis, expected in  \nFebruary and August. Based on the latest      \nreport as of February 2022, approximately $   \n450million in assets and proceeds from assets \nhas been returned to the Government of        \nMalaysia in connection with this guarantee,   \nwhich must be satisfied by August 2025. Any   \namounts paid by the firm under this guarantee \nwould be subject to reimbursement in the event\nthe assets and proceeds received by the       \nGovernment of Malaysia through August 18, 2028\nexceed $ 1.4billion. See Note 27 for further  \ninformation about matters related to 1MDB.    \nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The\nfirm has established trusts, including Goldman\nSachs Capital I, the APEX Trusts and other    \nentities, for the limited purpose of issuing  \nsecurities to third parties, lending the      \nproceeds to the firm and entering into        \ncontractual arrangements with the firm and    \nthird parties related to this purpose. The    \nfirm does not consolidate these entities. See \nNote 14 for further information about the     \ntransactions involving Goldman Sachs Capital I\nand the APEX Trusts. The firm effectively     \nprovides for the full and unconditional       \nguarantee of the securities issued by these   \nentities. Timely payment by the firm of       \namounts due to these entities under the       \nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and     \nrelated contractual arrangements will be      \nsufficient to cover payments due on the       \nsecurities issued by these entities. No       \nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the       \nsecurities of Goldman Sachs Capital I or the  \nAPEX Trusts. Management believes that it is   \nunlikely that any circumstances will occur,   \nsuch as nonperformance on the part of paying  \nagents or other service providers, that would \nmake it necessary for the firm to make        \npayments related to these entities other than \nthose required under the terms of the         \nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and     \nrelated contractual arrangements and in       \nconnection with certain expenses incurred by  \nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of \nService Providers. In the ordinary course of  \nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees \ncertain service providers, such as clearing   \nand custody agents, trustees and              \nadministrators, against specified potential   \nlosses in connection with their acting as an  \nagent of, or providing services to, the firm  \nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses   \narising from its custodial role or caused by  \nacts or omissions of third-party service      \nproviders, including sub-custodiansand third- \nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has \nthe right to seek indemnification from these  \nthird-party service providers for certain     \nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In      \naddition, the firm is a member of payment,    \nclearing and settlement networks, as well as  \nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of   \nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of   \nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In  \nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear \nand settle on behalf of its clients the       \ntransactions entered into by them with other  \nbrokerage firms. The firm\u2019s obligations in    \nrespect of such transactions are secured by   \nthe assets in the client\u2019s account, as well as\nany proceeds received from the transactions   \ncleared and settled by the firm on behalf of  \nthe client. In connection with joint venture  \ninvestments, the firm may issue loan          \nguarantees under which it may be liable in the\nevent of fraud, misappropriation,             \nenvironmental liabilities and certain other   \nmatters involving the borrower. The firm is   \nunable to develop an estimate of the maximum  \npayout under these guarantees and             \nindemnifications. However, management believes\nthat it is unlikely the firm will have to make\nany material payments under these             \narrangements, and no material liabilities     \nrelated to these guarantees and               \nindemnifications have been recognized in the  \nconsolidated balance sheets as of both March  \n2022 and December 2021.                       \n                                            \n  67    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Regulation and Capital Adequacy The  \nFRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a \nbank holding company under the U.S. Bank      \nHolding Company Act of 1956 and a financial   \nholding company under amendments to this Act. \nThe firm is subject to consolidated regulatory\ncapital requirements which are calculated in  \naccordance with the regulations of the FRB    \n(Capital Framework). The capital requirements \nare expressed as risk-based capital and       \nleverage ratios that compare measures of      \nregulatory capital to risk-weighted assets    \n(RWAs), average assets and off-balancesheet   \nexposures. Failure to comply with these       \ncapital requirements would result in          \nrestrictions being imposed by the firm\u2019s      \nregulators and could limit the firm\u2019s ability \nto repurchase shares, pay dividends and make  \ncertain discretionary compensation payments.  \nThe firm\u2019s capital levels are also subject to \nqualitative judgments by the regulators about \ncomponents of capital, risk weightings and    \nother factors. Furthermore, certain of the    \nfirm\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to separate   \nregulations and capital requirements. Capital \nFramework The regulations under the Capital   \nFramework are largely based on the Basel      \nCommittee on Banking Supervision\u2019s (Basel     \nCommittee) capital framework for strengthening\ninternational capital standards (Basel III)   \nand also implement certain provisions of the  \nDodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework,  \nthe firm is an \u201cAdvanced approaches\u201d banking  \norganization and has been designated as a     \nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB).   \nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum    \nrisk-based capital and the capital            \nconservation buffer requirements. The buffer  \nmust consist entirely of capital that         \nqualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)      \ncapital. The firm calculates its CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in    \naccordance with both the Standardized and     \nAdvanced Capital Rules. Each of the ratios    \ncalculated under the Standardized and Advanced\nCapital Rules must meet its respective capital\nrequirements. Under the Capital Framework, the\nfirm is also subject to leverage requirements \nwhich consist of a minimum Tier 1 leverage    \nratio and a minimum supplementary leverage    \nratio (SLR), as well as the SLR buffer.       \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    70  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

For\nrisk management\npurposes, a 95 % one-\nday VaR is used,\nwhereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements,\na 99 % 10-day VaR is\nused to determine\nMarket RWAs and a 99 %\none-day VaR is used to\ndetermine regulatory\nVaR exceptions. In\naddition, the daily\nnet revenues used to\ndetermine risk\nmanagement VaR\nexceptions (i.e.,\ncomparing the daily\nnet revenues to the\nVaR measure calculated\nas of the end of the\nprior business day)\ninclude intraday\nactivity, whereas the\nCapital Framework\nrequires that intraday\nactivity be excluded\nfrom daily net\nrevenues when\ncalculating regulatory\nVaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity\nincludes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are\nmore likely than not\nto be positive by\ntheir nature. As a\nresult, there may be\ndifferences in the\nnumber of VaR\nexceptions and the\namount of daily net\nrevenues calculated\nfor regulatory VaR\ncompared to the\namounts calculated for\nrisk management VaR.\n\nThe firm\u2019s positional\nlosses observed on a\nsingle day exceeded\nits 99 % one-day\nregulatory VaR on one\noccasion during both\nthe three months ended\nMarch\u00a02022 and the\nyear ended 2021.

These\ndecreases were\npartially offset by an\nincrease in other\ncredit RWAs\n(principally due to\nincreased other assets\nandcustomer and other\nreceivables\nexposures), an\nincrease in\ncommitments,\nguarantees and loans\n(principally due to\nincreased lending\nactivity) and an\nincrease in securities\nfinancing transactions\n(principally due to\nincreased funding\nexposures).\nStandardized Market\nRWAs as of March 2022\nincreased by $ 5.50\nbillion compared with\nDecember 2021,\nprimarily reflecting\nan increase in\nregulatory VaR\n(principally due to\nhigher levels of\nmarket volatility in\ncommodity prices) and\nan increase in\nspecific risk\n(principally due to\nincreased exposures to\nsecuritized products).\nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of March 2022         \nincreased by$ 18.91 billion compared with     \nDecember 2021, primarily reflecting an        \nincrease in derivatives (principally due to   \nincreased counterparty credit risk) and an    \nincrease in other credit RWAs (principally due\nto increased other assets andcustomer and     \nother receivables exposures). These increases \nwere partially offset by a decrease in equity \ninvestments (principally due to reduced       \nexposures as a result of unrealized losses).  \nAdvanced Market RWAs as of March 2022         \nincreased by$ 5.50 billion compared with      \nDecember 2021, primarily reflecting an        \nincrease in regulatory VaR (principally due to\nhigher levels of market volatility in         \ncommodity prices) and an increase in specific \nrisk (principally due to increased exposures  \nto securitized products). Year Ended December \n2021. Standardized Credit RWAs as of December \n2021 increased by $ 114.92billion compared    \nwith December 2020, primarily reflecting an   \nincrease in commitments, guarantees and loans \n(principally due to increased lending activity\nand revisions to certain interpretations of   \nthe Capital Rules underlying the RWA          \ncalculation based on regulatory feedback) and \nan increase in derivatives (principally due to\nincreased exposures and the impact of SA-     \nCCRadoption). Standardized Market RWAs as of  \nDecember 2021 increased by $ 7.79billion      \ncompared with December 2020, primarily        \nreflecting an increase in stressed VaR        \n(principally due to increased exposures to    \ninterest rates). Advanced Credit RWAs as of   \nDecember 2021 increased by $ 25.79billion     \ncompared with December 2020, primarily        \nreflecting an increase in commitments,        \nguarantees and loans (principally due to      \nincreased lending activity). This increase was\npartially offset by a decrease in equity      \ninvestments (principally due to the sale of   \nequity positions). Advanced Market RWAs as of \nDecember 2021 increased by $ 7.79billion      \ncompared with December 2020, primarily        \nreflecting an increase in stressed VaR        \n(principally due to increased exposures to    \ninterest rates).

Restrictions on Payments  \nGroup Inc. may be limited in its ability to   \naccess capital held at certain subsidiaries as\na result of regulatory, tax or other          \nconstraints. These limitations include        \nprovisions of applicable law and regulations  \nand other regulatory restrictions that limit  \nthe ability of those subsidiaries to declare  \nand pay dividends without prior regulatory    \napproval. For example, the amount of dividends\nthat may be paid by GS Bank USA are limited to\nthe lesser of the amounts calculated under a  \nrecent earnings test and an undivided profits \ntest. As a result of dividends paid in        \nconnection with the acquisition of GSBE in    \nJuly 2021, GS Bank USA cannot currently       \ndeclare any additional dividends without prior\nregulatory approval. In addition, subsidiaries\nnot subject to separate regulatory capital    \nrequirements may hold capital to satisfy local\ntax and legal guidelines, rating agency       \nrequirements (for entities with assigned      \ncredit ratings) or internal policies,         \nincluding policies concerning the minimum     \namount of capital a subsidiary should hold    \nbased on its underlying level of risk.

Income Taxes Provision for Income    \nTaxes Income taxes are provided for using the \nasset and liability method under which        \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are       \nrecognized for temporary differences between  \nthe financial reporting and tax bases of      \nassets and liabilities. The firm reports      \ninterest expense related to income tax matters\nin provision for taxes and income tax         \npenalties in other expenses. Deferred Income  \nTaxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net   \ntax effects of temporary differences between  \nthe financial reporting and tax bases of      \nassets and liabilities. These temporary       \ndifferences result in taxable or deductible   \namounts in future years and are measured using\nthe tax rates and laws that will be in effect \nwhen such differences are expected to reverse.\nValuation allowances are established to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount that more   \nlikely than not will be realized and primarily\nrelate to the ability to utilize losses in    \nvarious tax jurisdictions. Tax assets are     \nincluded in other assets and tax liabilities  \nare included in other liabilities.            \nUnrecognized Tax Benefits The firm recognizes \ntax positions in the consolidated financial   \nstatements only when it is more likely than   \nnot that the position will be sustained on    \nexamination by the relevant taxing authority  \nbased on the technical merits of the position.\nA position that meets this standard is        \nmeasured at the largest amount of benefit that\nwill more likely than not be realized on      \nsettlement. A liability is established for    \ndifferences between positions taken in a tax  \nreturn and amounts recognized in the          \nconsolidated financial statements. Regulatory \nTax Examinations The firm is subject to       \nexamination by the U.S. Internal Revenue      \nService (IRS) and other taxing authorities in \njurisdictions where the firm has significant  \nbusiness operations, such as the United       \nKingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states, \nsuch as New York. The tax years under         \nexamination vary by jurisdiction. The firm    \ndoes not expect completion of these audits to \nhave a material impact on the firm\u2019s financial\ncondition, but it may be material to operating\nresults for a particular period, depending, in\npart, on the operating results for that       \nperiod.                                       \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    80  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\n2019 and 2020 tax\nyears remain subject\nto post-filing review.\nNew York State and\nCity examinations of\n2015 through 2018\ncommenced during 2021.\n\nAll years, including\nand subsequent to the\nyears in the table\nabove, remain open to\nexamination by the\ntaxing authorities.\nThe firm believes that\nthe liability for\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits it has\nestablished is\nadequate in relation\nto the potential for\nadditional\nassessments.\nNote 25. Business Segments The firm reports   \nits activities in four business segments:     \nInvestment Banking, Global Markets, Asset     \nManagement and Consumer & Wealth Management.  \nSee Note 1 for information about the firm\u2019s   \nbusiness segments. Compensation and benefits  \nexpenses in the firm\u2019s segments reflect, among\nother factors, the overall performance of the \nfirm, as well as the performance of individual\nbusinesses. Consequently, pre-taxmargins in   \none segment of the firm\u2019s business may be     \nsignificantly affected by the performance of  \nthe firm\u2019s other business segments. The firm  \nallocates assets (including allocations of    \nglobal core liquid assets and cash, secured   \nclient financing and other assets), revenues  \nand expenses among the four business segments.\nDue to the integrated nature of these         \nsegments, estimates and judgments are made in \nallocating certain assets, revenues and       \nexpenses. The allocation process is based on  \nthe manner in which management currently views\nthe performance of the segments. The          \nallocation of common shareholders\u2019 equity and \npreferred stock dividends to each segment is  \nbased on the estimated amount of equity       \nrequired to support the activities of the     \nsegment under relevant regulatory capital     \nrequirements. Net earnings for each segment is\ncalculated by applying the firmwide tax rate  \nto each segment\u2019s pre-taxearnings. Management \nbelieves that this allocation provides a      \nreasonable representation of each segment\u2019s   \ncontribution to consolidated net earnings to  \ncommon, return on average common equity and   \ntotal assets. Transactions between segments   \nare based on specific criteria or approximate \nthird-party rates.                            \n                                            \n  81    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nfirm seeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by actively\nmonitoring exposures\nand obtaining\ncollateral from\ncounterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm considers\nwhen determining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts.

In addition, GS   \nMalaysia pleaded guilty to one count of       \nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was       \nsentenced on June 9, 2021. In May 2021, the   \nU.S. Department of Labor granted the firm a   \nfive-year exemption to maintain its status as \na qualified professional asset manager (QPAM).\nThe firm has received multiple demands,       \nbeginning in November 2018, from alleged      \nshareholders under Section 220 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law for books and records \nrelating to, among other things, the firm\u2019s   \ninvolvement with 1MDB and the firm\u2019s          \ncompliance procedures.

On February 3, 2022, the parties reached\na settlement in principle, subject to final   \ndocumentation and court approval, to resolve  \nthis action. In January and February 2021,    \nrespectively, the firm received two demands   \n(in addition to three demands that the Board  \nhad previously rejected and were subsequently \nsettled) from alleged shareholders to         \ninvestigate and pursue claims related to 1MDB \n(and, for one of the demands, other matters)  \nagainst other parties, including certain      \ncurrent and former directors and executive    \nofficers of the firm.

Based on our reviews, \nwe are not aware of any material modifications\nthat should be made to the accompanying       \ninterim financial statements for them to be in\nconformity with accounting principles         \ngenerally accepted in the United States of    \nAmerica. We have previously audited, in       \naccordance with the standards of the Public   \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United    \nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance     \nsheet of the Company as of December 31, 2021, \nand the related consolidated statements of    \nearnings, comprehensive income, changes in    \nshareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for the   \nyear then ended (not presented herein), and in\nour report dated February 24, 2022, which     \nincluded a paragraph describing a change in   \nthe manner of accounting for credit losses on \ncertain financial instruments in the 2020     \nconsolidated financial statements, we         \nexpressed an unqualified opinion on those     \nconsolidated financial statements. In our     \nopinion, the information set forth in the     \naccompanying consolidated balance sheet as of \nDecember 31, 2021 is fairly stated in all     \nmaterial respects in relation to the          \nconsolidated balance sheet from which it has  \nbeen derived. Basis for Review Results These  \ninterim financial statements are the          \nresponsibility of the Company\u2019s management. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with  \nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent  \nwith respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the      \napplicable rules and regulations of the       \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the    \nPCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance  \nwith the standards of the PCAOB. A review of  \ninterim financial information consists        \nprincipally of applying analytical procedures \nand making inquiries of persons responsible   \nfor financial and accounting matters. It is   \nsubstantially less in scope than an audit     \nconducted in accordance with the standards of \nthe PCAOB, the objective of which is the      \nexpression of an opinion regarding the        \nfinancial statements taken as a whole.        \nAccordingly, we do not express such an        \nopinion. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New   \nYork, New York April 29 , 2022                \n                                            \n  95    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Executive Overview We generated \nnet earnings of $3.94 billion for the first   \nquarter of 2022, a decrease of 42% compared   \nwith $6.84 billion for the first quarter of   \n2021. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) \nwas $10.76 for the first quarter of 2022, a   \ndecrease of 42% compared with $18.60 for the  \nfirst quarter of 2021. Annualized return on   \naverage common shareholders\u2019 equity (ROE) was \n15.0% for the first quarter of 2022, compared \nwith 31.0% for the first quarter of 2021. Book\nvalue per common share was $293.31 as of March\n2022, 3.1% higher compared with December 2021.\nNet revenues were $12.93 billion for the first\nquarter of 2022, 27% lower than a strong first\nquarter of 2021, reflecting significantly     \nlower net revenues in Asset Management and    \nInvestment Banking, partially offset by higher\nnet revenues in Consumer & Wealth Management  \nand Global Markets. Broad macroeconomic and   \ngeopolitical concerns contributed to          \nvolatility in global equity prices and wider  \ncredit spreads, contributing to net losses in \nEquity investments and significantly lower net\nrevenues in Lending and debt investments      \nwithin Asset Management and significantly     \nlower net revenues in Equity underwriting     \nwithin Investment Banking. Net revenues in    \nConsumer & Wealth Management reflected growth \nin both Wealth management and Consumer banking\nnet revenues, and net revenues in Global      \nMarkets reflected significantly higher net    \nrevenues in Fixed Income, Currency and        \nCommodities (FICC), partially offset by lower \nnet revenues in Equities compared with a      \nstrong prior year period. Provision for credit\nlosses was $561 million for the first quarter \nof 2022, compared with a net benefit of $70   \nmillion in the first quarter of 2021.         \nProvisions in the first quarter of 2022       \nprimarily reflected portfolio growth          \n(primarily in credit cards), the impact of    \nmacroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, and  \nindividual impairments on wholesale loans. The\nnet benefit in the first quarter of 2021      \nreflected reserve reductions as the broader   \neconomic environment continued to improve     \nfollowing the initial impact of the           \ncoronavirus (COVID-19)pandemic, partially     \noffset by portfolio growth.                   \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    98  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Operating\nexpenses were $7.72 billion for the first     \nquarter of 2022, 18% lower than the first     \nquarter of 2021, primarily due to             \nsignificantly lower compensation and benefits \nexpenses (reflecting a decline in operating   \nperformance compared with a strong prior year \nperiod), partially offset by higher non-      \ncompensationexpenses. Our efficiency ratio    \n(total operating expenses divided by total net\nrevenues) for the first quarter of 2022 was   \n59.7%, compared with 53.3% for the first      \nquarter of 2021. We returned $1.21 billion of \ncapital to common shareholders, including $500\nmillion of common share repurchases and $711  \nmillion of common stock dividends. As of March\n2022, our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital \nratio was 14.4% under the Standardized Capital\nRules and 14.6% under the Advanced Capital    \nRules. See Note 20 to the consolidated        \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout our capital ratios. In March 2022, we   \ncompleted the acquisition of GreenSky, Inc.   \n(GreenSky) in our Consumer banking business,  \nand in April 2022, we completed the           \nacquisition of NN Investment Partners in our  \nAsset Management business. We expect these    \nstrategic acquisitions to accelerate our      \nstrategy to drive more durable returns. In the\nfirst quarter of 2022, we announced that over \nthe medium-term (approximately 3 years), our  \ntarget is to achieve (i) ROE within a range of\n14% to 16%, (ii) return on average tangible   \ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity (ROTE) within a   \nrange of 15% to 17% and (iii) an efficiency   \nratio of approximately 60%. In addition, we   \nannounced that our target is to maintain      \ncapital ratios equal to the regulatory        \nrequirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100 basis \npoints. Business Environment During the first \nquarter of 2022, global economic activity was \nimpacted by macroeconomic uncertainty and     \nmarket volatility resulting from geopolitical \nconcerns, including Russia\u2019s invasion of      \nUkraine, increased inflationary and labor     \nmarket pressures and stress on supply chains, \nrising prices of commodities and continued    \nCOVID-19concerns. Governments around the world\nresponded to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine by  \nimposing economic sanctions, and global       \ncentral banks began addressing inflation by   \nincreasing policy interest rates. In addition,\ncertain parts of the world responded to the   \nrise in cases of the Omicron variant by       \nresuming lockdowns and restrictions. These    \nfactors contributed to a decline in global    \nequity prices and widening corporate credit   \nspreads compared with the end of the fourth   \nquarter of 2021. The economic outlook remains \nuncertain, reflecting concerns about the      \ncontinuation or escalation of the war between \nRussia and Ukraine and other geopolitical     \nrisks, inflation and supply chain             \ncomplications, and the persistence of         \nCOVID-19-relatedeffects.

Trading assets and           \nliabilities, certain investments and loans,   \nand certain other financial assets and        \nliabilities, are included in our consolidated \nbalance sheets at fair value (i.e., marked-to-\nmarket),with related gains or losses generally\nrecognized in our consolidated statements of  \nearnings. The use of fair value to measure    \nfinancial instruments is fundamental to our   \nrisk management practices and is our most     \ncritical accounting policy. The fair value of \na financial instrument is the amount that     \nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. We measure certain financial assets and \nliabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its\nnet exposure to market and/or credit risks).  \nIn determining fair value, the hierarchy under\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles \n(U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to \nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical, unrestricted assets or liabilities \n(level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to   \ninputs other than level 1 inputs that are     \nobservable, either directly or indirectly     \n(level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest        \npriority to inputs that cannot be observed in \nmarket activity (level 3 inputs). In          \nevaluating the significance of a valuation    \ninput, we consider, among other factors, a    \nportfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to that input.  \nAssets and liabilities are classified in their\nentirety based on the lowest level of input   \nthat is significant to their fair value       \nmeasurement. The fair values for substantially\nall of our financial assets and liabilities   \nare based on observable prices and inputs and \nare classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair  \nvalue hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3  \nfinancial assets and liabilities may require  \nappropriate valuation adjustments that a      \nmarket participant would require to arrive at \nfair value for factors, such as counterparty  \nand our credit quality, funding risk, transfer\nrestrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads.\n                                            \n  99    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Allowance\nfor Credit Losses We estimate and record an   \nallowance for credit losses related to our    \nloans held for investment that are accounted  \nfor at amortized cost. To determine the       \nallowance for credit losses, we classify our  \nloans accounted for at amortized cost into    \nwholesale and consumer portfolios. These      \nportfolios represent the level at which we    \nhave developed and documented our methodology \nto determine the allowance for credit losses. \nThe allowance for credit losses is measured on\na collective basis for loans that exhibit     \nsimilar risk characteristics using a modeled  \napproach and asset-specific basis for loans   \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics. The allowance for credit     \nlosses takes into account the weighted average\nof a range of forecasts of future economic    \nconditions over the expected life of the loans\nand lending commitments. The expected life of \neach loan or lending commitment is determined \nbased on the contractual term adjusted for    \nextension options or demand features, or is   \nmodeled in the case of revolving credit card  \nloans. The forecasts include baseline,        \nfavorable and adverse economic scenarios over \na three-year period. For loans with expected  \nlives beyond three years, the model reverts to\nhistorical loss information based on a non-   \nlinearmodeled approach. We apply judgment in  \nweighting individual scenarios each quarter   \nbased on a variety of factors, including our  \ninternally derived economic outlook, market   \nconsensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and\nindustry trends. The forecasted economic      \nscenarios consider a number of risk factors   \nrelevant to the wholesale and consumer        \nportfolios. Risk factors for wholesale loans  \ninclude internal credit ratings, industry     \ndefault and loss data, expected life,         \nmacroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment  \nrates and GDP), the borrower\u2019s capacity to    \nmeet its financial obligations, the borrower\u2019s\ncountry of risk and industry, loan seniority  \nand collateral type. In addition, for loans   \nbacked by real estate, risk factors include   \nloan-to-valueratio, debt service ratio and    \nhome price index. Risk factors for installment\nand credit card loans include Fair Isaac      \nCorporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency \nstatus, loan vintage and macroeconomic        \nindicators. The allowance for credit losses   \nalso includes qualitative components which    \nallow management to reflect the uncertain     \nnature of economic forecasting, capture       \nuncertainty regarding model inputs, and       \naccount for model imprecision and             \nconcentration risk. Our estimate of credit    \nlosses entails judgment about collectability  \nat the reporting dates, and there are         \nuncertainties inherent in those judgments. The\nallowance for credit losses is subject to a   \ngovernance process that involves review and   \napproval by senior management within our      \nindependent risk oversight and control        \nfunctions. Personnel within our independent   \nrisk oversight and control functions are      \nresponsible for forecasting the economic      \nvariables that underlie the economic scenarios\nthat are used in the modeling of expected     \ncredit losses. While we use the best          \ninformation available to determine this       \nestimate, future adjustments to the allowance \nmay be necessary based on, among other things,\nchanges in the economic environment or        \nvariances between actual results and the      \noriginal assumptions used. Loans are charged  \noff against the allowance for loan losses when\ndeemed to be uncollectible. We also record an \nallowance for credit losses on lending        \ncommitments which are held for investment that\nare accounted for at amortized cost. Such     \nallowance is determined using the same        \nmethodology as the allowance for loan losses, \nwhile also taking into consideration the      \nprobability of drawdowns or funding, and      \nwhether such commitments are cancellable by   \nus. To estimate the potential impact of an    \nadverse macroeconomic environment on our      \nallowance for credit losses, we, among other  \nthings, compared the expected credit losses   \nunder the weighted average forecast used in   \nthe calculation of allowance for credit losses\nas of March 2022 (which was primarily weighted\ntowards the baseline economic scenario) to the\nexpected credit losses under a 100% weighted  \nadverse economic scenario. The adverse        \nmacroeconomic model assumes a global recession\nin the second half of 2022 through the first  \nhalf of 2023, an emergence of new vaccine-    \nresistant strains of COVID-19resulting in a   \nresurgence of infections, an economic         \ncontraction, high inflation rates in the      \ninitial quarters, gradually climbing          \nunemployment rates, decline in GDP growth     \nrates, elevated commodity prices and          \ndislocations in the economy due to shortages  \nin the supply of some goods and services. A   \n100% weighting to the adverse economic        \nscenario would have resulted in an approximate\n$1.3 billion increase in our allowance for    \ncredit losses as of March 2022. This          \nhypothetical increase does not take into      \nconsideration any potential adjustments to    \nqualitative reserves. The forecasts of        \nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently       \nuncertain and do not take into account any    \nother offsetting or correlated effects. The   \nactual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic\nenvironment may differ significantly from this\nestimate. See Note 9 to the consolidated      \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout the allowance for credit losses.        \n                                             \n  101    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                             \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Use of   \nEstimates U.S. GAAP requires us to make       \ncertain estimates and assumptions. In addition\nto the estimates we make in connection with   \nfair value measurements and the allowance for \ncredit losses on loans and lending commitments\nheld for investment and accounted for at      \namortized cost, the use of estimates and      \nassumptions is also important in determining  \ndiscretionary compensation accruals, the      \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and accounting for income    \ntaxes. A substantial portion of our           \ncompensation and benefits represents          \ndiscretionary compensation, which is finalized\nat year-end.We believe the most appropriate   \nway to allocate estimated year-               \nenddiscretionary compensation among interim   \nperiods is in proportion to the net revenues  \nnet of provision for credit losses earned in  \nsuch periods. In addition to the level of net \nrevenues net of provision for credit losses,  \nour overall compensation expense in any given \nyear is also influenced by, among other       \nfactors, overall financial performance,       \nprevailing labor markets, business mix, the   \nstructure of our share-based compensation     \nprograms and the external environment.        \nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually  \nin the fourth quarter or more frequently if   \nevents occur or circumstances change that     \nindicate an impairment may exist. When        \nassessing goodwill for impairment, first, a   \nqualitative assessment can be made to         \ndetermine whether it is more likely than not  \nthat the estimated fair value of a reporting  \nunit is less than its estimated carrying      \nvalue. If the results of the qualitative      \nassessment are not conclusive, a quantitative \ngoodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a  \nquantitative goodwill test can be performed   \nwithout performing a qualitative assessment.  \nEstimating the fair value of our reporting    \nunits requires judgment. Critical inputs to   \nthe fair value estimates include projected    \nearnings and allocated equity. There is       \ninherent uncertainty in the projected         \nearnings. The estimated carrying value of each\nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and represents the       \nestimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity\nrequired to support the activities of the     \nreporting unit under currently applicable     \nregulatory capital requirements. See Note 12  \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about goodwill. If we     \nexperience a prolonged or severe period of    \nweakness in the business environment,         \nfinancial markets, our performance or our     \ncommon stock price, or additional increases in\ncapital requirements, our goodwill could be   \nimpaired in the future. Identifiable          \nintangible assets are tested for impairment   \nwhen events or changes in circumstances       \nsuggest that an asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s      \ncarrying value may not be fully recoverable.  \nJudgment is required to evaluate whether      \nindications of potential impairment have      \noccurred, and to test identifiable intangible \nassets for impairment, if required. An        \nimpairment is recognized if the estimated     \nundiscounted cash flows relating to the asset \nor asset group is less than the corresponding \ncarrying value. See Note 12 to the            \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about identifiable intangible     \nassets. We also estimate and provide for      \npotential losses that may arise out of        \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings to the  \nextent that such losses are probable and can  \nbe reasonably estimated. In addition, we      \nestimate the upper end of the range of        \nreasonably possible aggregate loss in excess  \nof the related reserves for litigation and    \nregulatory proceedings where we believe the   \nrisk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18\nand 27 to the consolidated financial          \nstatements for information about certain      \njudicial, litigation and regulatory           \nproceedings. Significant judgment is required \nin making these estimates and our final       \nliabilities may ultimately be materially      \ndifferent. Our total estimated liability in   \nrespect of litigation and regulatory          \nproceedings is determined on a case-by-       \ncasebasis and represents an estimate of       \nprobable losses after considering, among other\nfactors, the progress of each case, proceeding\nor investigation, our experience and the      \nexperience of others in similar cases,        \nproceedings or investigations, and the        \nopinions and views of legal counsel. In       \naccounting for income taxes, we recognize tax \npositions in the financial statements only    \nwhen it is more likely than not that the      \nposition will be sustained on examination by  \nthe relevant taxing authority based on the    \ntechnical merits of the position. We use      \nestimates to recognize current and deferred   \nincome taxes in the U.S. federal, state and   \nlocal and non-U.S.jurisdictions in which we   \noperate. The income tax laws in these         \njurisdictions are complex and can be subject  \nto different interpretations between taxpayers\nand taxing authorities. Disputes may arise    \nover these interpretations and can be settled \nby audit, administrative appeals or judicial  \nproceedings. Our interpretations are          \nreevaluated quarterly based on guidance       \ncurrently available, tax examination          \nexperience and the opinions of legal counsel, \namong other factors. We recognize deferred    \ntaxes based on the amount that will more      \nlikely than not be realized in the future     \nbased on enacted income tax laws. Our estimate\nfor deferred taxes includes estimates for     \nfuture taxable earnings, including the level  \nand character of those earnings, and various  \ntax planning strategies.

During the first       \nquarter of 2022, Investment Banking operated  \nin an environment generally characterized by  \ncontinued strong industry-wide mergers and    \nacquisition volumes, although volumes declined\ncompared with an elevated level during the    \nfourth quarter of 2021, and a significant     \nslowdown in industry-wide equity underwriting \nvolumes as equity markets were volatile amid  \nan evolving macroeconomic environment. For    \nindustry-wide debt underwriting volumes,      \nleveraged finance activity decreased          \nsignificantly, while investment-grade activity\nimproved compared with the fourth quarter of  \n2021. In the future, if market and economic   \nconditions deteriorate further, and industry- \nwide mergers and acquisitions or equity       \nunderwriting volumes continue to decline, or  \nindustry-wide debt underwriting volumes       \ndecline, or credit spreads related to hedges  \non our relationship lending portfolio tighten,\nnet revenues in Investment Banking would      \nlikely be negatively impacted. In addition, if\neconomic conditions deteriorate further or if \nthe creditworthiness of borrowers             \ndeteriorates, provision for credit losses     \nwould likely be negatively impacted. Three    \nMonths Ended March 2022 versus March 2021. Net\nrevenues in Investment Banking were $2.41     \nbillion for the first quarter of 2022, 36%    \nlower than a strong first quarter of 2021,    \nreflecting significantly lower net revenues in\nUnderwriting. The decrease in Underwriting was\ndue to significantly lower net revenues in    \nEquity underwriting, reflecting a significant \ndecline in industry-wide activity, and lower  \nnet revenues in Debt underwriting, due to     \nlower net revenues from leveraged finance and \nasset-backed activity. Corporate lending net  \nrevenues were higher, primarily due to higher \nnet revenues from relationship lending        \nactivities, reflecting net gains from the     \nimpact of widening credit spreads on hedges.  \nNet revenues in Financial advisory were       \nessentially unchanged. Provision for credit   \nlosses was $164 million for the first quarter \nof 2022, compared with net benefit of $163    \nmillion for the first quarter of 2021.        \nProvisions in the first quarter of 2022       \nprimarily reflected portfolio growth, the     \nimpact of macroeconomic and geopolitical      \nconcerns, and individual impairments.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis The FRB  \nevaluates us based, in part, on whether we    \nhave the capital necessary to continue        \noperating under the baseline and severely     \nadverse scenarios provided by the FRB and     \nthose developed internally. This evaluation   \nalso takes into account our process for       \nidentifying risk, our controls and governance \nfor capital planning, and our guidelines for  \nmaking capital planning decisions. In         \naddition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make  \ncapital distributions (i.e., dividend payments\nand repurchases or redemptions of stock,      \nsubordinated debt or other capital securities)\nand issue capital, across the range of        \nmacroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific     \nassumptions. The FRB determines the stress    \ncapital buffer (SCB) applicable to us based on\nits own annual stress test. The SCB under the \nStandardized approach is calculated as (i) the\ndifference between our starting and minimum   \nprojected CET1 capital ratios under the       \nsupervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii)\nour planned common stock dividends for each of\nthe fourth through seventh quarters of the    \nplanning horizon, expressed as a percentage of\nrisk-weighted assets (RWAs). Based on our 2021\nCCAR submission, the FRB reduced our SCB from \n6.6% to 6.4%, resulting in a Standardized CET1\ncapital ratio requirement of 13.4% for the    \nperiod from October 1, 2021 through September \n30, 2022. See \u201cShare Repurchase Program\u201d for  \nfurther information about common stock        \nrepurchases and dividends. We submitted our   \n2022 CCAR capital plan in April 2022 and      \nexpect to publish a summary of our annual     \nDFAST results in June 2022. See \u201cAvailable    \nInformation.\u201d GS Bank USA is required to      \nconduct stress tests on an annual basis and   \npublish a summary of certain results. GS Bank \nUSA submitted its 2022 DFAST capital plan to  \nthe FRB in April 2022 and expects to publish a\nsummary of the annual DFAST results in June   \n2022. See \u201cAvailable Information.\u201d GSI, GSIB  \nand Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) also  \nhave their own capital planning and stress    \ntesting processes, which incorporate          \ninternally designed stress tests developed in \naccordance with the guidelines of their       \nrespective regulators. Contingency Capital    \nPlan. As part of our comprehensive capital    \nmanagement policy, we maintain a contingency  \ncapital plan. Our contingency capital plan    \nprovides a framework for analyzing and        \nresponding to a perceived or actual capital   \ndeficiency, including, but not limited to,    \nidentification of drivers of a capital        \ndeficiency, as well as mitigants and potential\nactions. It outlines the appropriate          \ncommunication procedures to follow during a   \ncrisis period, including internal             \ndissemination of information, as well as      \ntimely communication with external            \nstakeholders. Capital Attribution. We assess  \neach of our businesses\u2019 capital usage based on\nour internal assessment of risks, which       \nincorporates an attribution of our relevant   \nregulatory capital requirements. These        \nregulatory capital requirements are allocated \nusing our attributed equity framework, which  \ntakes into consideration our most binding     \ncapital constraints. Our most binding capital \nconstraint is based on the results of the     \nFRB\u2019s annual stress test, which includes the  \nStandardized risk-based capital and leverage  \nratios. We review and make any necessary      \nadjustments to our attributed equity in       \nJanuary each year, to reflect, among other    \nthings, the results of our latest CCAR        \nprocess, as well as projected changes in our  \nbalance sheet. On January 1, 2022, our        \nallocation of attributed equity changed       \n(relative to the allocation as of December    \n2021) as follows: attributed equity increased \nby approximately $1.0 billion for Consumer &  \nWealth Management and approximately $0.5      \nbillion for Investment Banking, while         \nattributed equity decreased by approximately  \n$0.8 billion for Global Markets and           \napproximately $0.7 billion for Asset          \nManagement. See \u201cSegment Assets and Operating \nResults \u2014 Segment Operating Results\u201d for      \ninformation about our average quarterly       \nattributed equity by segment. Share Repurchase\nProgram. We use our share repurchase program  \nto help maintain the appropriate level of     \ncommon equity. The repurchase program is      \neffected primarily through regular open-market\npurchases (which may include repurchase plans \ndesigned to comply with Rule 10b5-1and        \naccelerated share repurchases), the amounts   \nand timing of which are determined primarily  \nby our current and projected capital position \nand our capital plan submitted to the FRB as  \npart of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the   \nrepurchases may also be influenced by general \nmarket conditions and the prevailing price and\ntrading volumes of our common stock. During   \nthe first quarter of 2022, we returned a total\nof $1.21 billion to shareholders, including   \ncommon stock repurchases of $500 million and  \n$711 million in common stock dividends.       \nConsistent with our capital management        \nphilosophy, we will continue prioritizing     \ndeployment of capital for our clients where   \nreturns are attractive and return any excess  \ncapital to shareholders through dividends and \nshare repurchases. As of March 2022, the      \nremaining share authorization under our       \nexisting repurchase program was 33.0 million  \nshares.

Overview and Structure of \nRisk Management Overview We believe that      \neffective risk management is critical to our  \nsuccess. Accordingly, we have established an  \nenterprise risk management framework that     \nemploys a comprehensive, integrated approach  \nto risk management, and is designed to enable \ncomprehensive risk management processes       \nthrough which we identify, assess, monitor and\nmanage the risks we assume in conducting our  \nactivities. Our risk management structure is  \nbuilt around three core components:           \ngovernance, processes and people. Governance. \nRisk management governance starts with the    \nBoard, which both directly and through its    \ncommittees, including its Risk Committee,     \noversees our risk management policies and     \npractices implemented through the enterprise  \nrisk management framework. The Board is also  \nresponsible for the annual review and approval\nof our risk appetite statement. The risk      \nappetite statement describes the levels and   \ntypes of risk we are willing to accept or to  \navoid, in order to achieve our objectives     \nincluded in our strategic business plan, while\nremaining in compliance with regulatory       \nrequirements. The Board reviews our strategic \nbusiness plan and is ultimately responsible   \nfor overseeing and providing direction about  \nour strategy and risk appetite. The Board     \nreceives regular briefings on firmwide risks, \nincluding liquidity risk, market risk, credit \nrisk, operational risk and model risk, from   \nour independent risk oversight and control    \nfunctions, including the chief risk officer,  \nand on compliance risk and conduct risk from  \nCompliance, on legal and regulatory           \nenforcement matters from the chief legal      \nofficer, and on other matters impacting our   \nreputation from the chair of our Firmwide     \nClient and Business Standards Committee and   \nour Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The \nchief risk officer reports to our chief       \nexecutive officer and to the Risk Committee of\nthe Board. As part of the review of the       \nfirmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk       \nofficer regularly advises the Risk Committee  \nof the Board of relevant risk metrics and     \nmaterial exposures, including risk limits and \nthresholds established in our risk appetite   \nstatement. The implementation of our risk     \ngovernance structure and core risk management \nprocesses are overseen by Enterprise Risk,    \nwhich reports to our chief risk officer, and  \nis responsible for ensuring that our          \nenterprise risk management framework provides \nthe Board, our risk committees and senior     \nmanagement with a consistent and integrated   \napproach to managing our various risks in a   \nmanner consistent with our risk appetite. Our \nrevenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, \nEngineering, Human Capital Management,        \nOperations, and Corporate and Workplace       \nSolutions, are considered our first line of   \ndefense. They are accountable for the outcomes\nof our risk-generating activities, as well as \nfor assessing and managing those risks within \nour risk appetite. Our independent risk       \noversight and control functions are considered\nour second line of defense and provide        \nindependent assessment, oversight and         \nchallenge of the risks taken by our first line\nof defense, as well as lead and participate in\nrisk committees. Independent risk oversight   \nand control functions include Compliance,     \nConflicts Resolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk\nand Tax. Internal Audit is considered our     \nthird line of defense, and our director of    \nInternal Audit reports to the Audit Committee \nof the Board and administratively to our chief\nexecutive officer.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Our      \ncredit risk management systems capture credit \nexposure to individual counterparties and on  \nan aggregate basis to counterparties and their\nsubsidiaries. These systems also provide      \nmanagement with comprehensive information     \nabout our aggregate credit risk by product,   \ninternal credit rating, industry, country and \nregion. Risk Measures We measure our credit   \nrisk based on the potential loss in the event \nof non-paymentby a counterparty using current \nand potential exposure. For derivatives and   \nsecurities financing transactions, current    \nexposure represents the amount presently owed \nto us after taking into account applicable    \nnetting and collateral arrangements, while    \npotential exposure represents our estimate of \nthe future exposure that could arise over the \nlife of a transaction based on market         \nmovements within a specified confidence level.\nPotential exposure also takes into account    \nnetting and collateral arrangements. For loans\nand lending commitments, the primary measure  \nis a function of the notional amount of the   \nposition. Stress Tests We conduct regular     \nstress tests to calculate the credit          \nexposures, including potential concentrations \nthat would result from applying shocks to     \ncounterparty credit ratings or credit risk    \nfactors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates,\nequity prices). These shocks cover a wide     \nrange of moderate and more extreme market     \nmovements, including shocks to multiple risk  \nfactors, consistent with the occurrence of a  \nsevere market or economic event. In the case  \nof sovereign default, we estimate the direct  \nimpact of the default on our sovereign credit \nexposures, changes to our credit exposures    \narising from potential market moves in        \nresponse to the default, and the impact of    \ncredit market deterioration on corporate      \nborrowers and counterparties that may result  \nfrom the sovereign default. Unlike potential  \nexposure, which is calculated within a        \nspecified confidence level, stress testing    \ndoes not generally assume a probability of    \nthese events occurring. We also perform       \nfirmwide stress tests. See \u201cOverview and      \nStructure of Risk Management\u201d for information \nabout firmwide stress tests. To supplement    \nthese regular stress tests, as described      \nabove, we also conduct tailored stress tests  \non an ad hoc basis in response to specific    \nmarket events that we deem significant. We    \nalso utilize these stress tests to estimate   \nthe indirect impact of certain hypothetical   \nevents on our country exposures, such as the  \nimpact of credit market deterioration on      \ncorporate borrowers and counterparties along  \nwith the shocks to the risk factors described \nabove. The parameters of these shocks vary    \nbased on the scenario reflected in each stress\ntest. We review estimated losses produced by  \nthe stress tests in order to understand their \nmagnitude, highlight potential loss           \nconcentrations, and assess and mitigate our   \nexposures where necessary. Limits We use      \ncredit risk limits at various levels, as well \nas underwriting standards to manage the size  \nand nature of our credit exposures. Limits for\nindustries and countries are based on our risk\nappetite and are designed to allow for regular\nmonitoring, review, escalation and management \nof credit risk concentrations. See \u201cOverview  \nand Structure of Risk Management\u201d for         \ninformation about the limit approval process. \nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring     \nthese limits, and identifying and escalating  \nto senior management and/or the appropriate   \nrisk committee, on a timely basis, instances  \nwhere limits have been exceeded. Risk         \nMitigants To reduce our credit exposures on   \nderivatives and securities financing          \ntransactions, we may enter into netting       \nagreements with counterparties that permit us \nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. We may also reduce credit risk\nwith counterparties by entering into          \nagreements that enable us to obtain collateral\nfrom them on an upfront or contingent basis   \nand/or to terminate transactions if the       \ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating falls below a    \nspecified level. We monitor the fair value of \nthe collateral to ensure that our credit      \nexposures are appropriately collateralized. We\nseek to minimize exposures where there is a   \nsignificant positive correlation between the  \ncreditworthiness of our counterparties and the\nmarket value of collateral we receive. For    \nloans and lending commitments, depending on   \nthe credit quality of the borrower and other  \ncharacteristics of the transaction, we employ \na variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk   \nmitigants include collateral provisions,      \nguarantees, covenants, structural seniority of\nthe bank loan claims and, for certain lending \ncommitments, provisions in the legal          \ndocumentation that allow us to adjust loan    \namounts, pricing, structure and other terms as\nmarket conditions change. The type and        \nstructure of risk mitigants employed can      \nsignificantly influence the degree of credit  \nrisk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into\na counterparty\u2019s financial strength or when we\nbelieve a counterparty requires support from  \nits parent, we may obtain third-party         \nguarantees of the counterparty\u2019s obligations. \nWe may also mitigate our credit risk using    \ncredit derivatives or participation           \nagreements.                                   \n                                             \n  143    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                             \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Country  \nExposures. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has\nnegatively affected the global economy and has\nresulted in significant disruptions in        \nfinancial markets and increased macroeconomic \nuncertainty. In addition, governments around  \nthe world have responded to Russia\u2019s invasion \nby imposing economic sanctions and export     \ncontrols on certain industry sectors,         \ncompanies and individuals in Russia. Russia   \nhas imposed its own restrictions against      \ninvestors and countries outside Russia and has\nproposed additional measures aimed at non-    \nRussian-owned businesses. Businesses in the   \nU.S. and globally have experienced shortages  \nin materials and increased costs for          \ntransportation, energy and raw materials due, \nin part, to the negative effects of the war on\nthe global economy. The escalation or         \ncontinuation of the war between Russia and    \nUkraine or other hostilities presents         \nheightened risks relating to cyber attacks,   \nthe frequency and volume of failures to settle\nsecurities transactions, supply chain         \ndisruptions, inflation, as well as the        \npotential for increased volatility in         \ncommodity, currency and other financial       \nmarkets. The extent and duration of the war,  \nsanctions and resulting market disruptions, as\nwell as the potential adverse consequences for\nour business, liquidity and results of        \noperations, are difficult to predict. We have \nbeen focused on closing our positions and     \nreducing our exposure, while continuing to    \nfacilitate the activity of our clients. In    \naddition, we are in the process of winding    \ndown our operations in Russia. The overall    \ndirect financial impact to our net revenues   \nfor the first quarter of 2022 from Russian and\nUkrainian counterparties, borrowers, issuers  \nand related instruments was a net loss of     \napproximately $300 million. Our total credit  \nexposure to Russia as of March 2022 was $260  \nmillion, substantially all of which was to    \nnon-sovereign counterparties. Such exposure   \nconsisted of $56 million related to OTC       \nderivatives and $204 million related to       \ndeposits and other receivables. In addition,  \nour total market exposure relating to Russian \nissuers as of March 2022 was not material. Our\ntotal credit exposure to Ukrainian            \ncounterparties or borrowers and our total     \nmarket exposure relating to Ukrainian issuers \nwas not material as of March 2022. High       \nexternal funding needs and inconsistent       \nmonetary policy have led to significant       \ndepreciation of the Turkish Lira, prompting   \nconcerns about foreign exchange reserves and  \neconomic instability. As of March 2022, our   \ntotal credit exposure to Turkey was $2.11     \nbillion, which was to non-                    \nsovereigncounterparties or borrowers. Such    \nexposure consisted of $1.40 billion related to\nOTC derivatives, $143 million related to loans\nand lending commitments and $567 million      \nrelated to secured receivables. After taking  \ninto consideration the benefit of Turkish     \ncorporate and sovereign collateral, and other \nrisk mitigants provided by Turkish            \ncounterparties, our net credit exposure was   \n$379 million. In addition, our total market   \nexposure relating to Turkish issuers as of    \nMarch 2022 was $(492) million, primarily to   \nsovereign issuers. Such exposure consisted of \n$21 million related to debt, $(616) million   \nrelated to credit derivatives and $103 million\nrelated to equities. Liquidity pressures      \nprompted the Argentine government to default  \nand restructure local and foreign obligations \nin 2020. Economic challenges persist despite a\nrenewed agreement with the International      \nMonetary Fund. As of March 2022, our total    \ncredit exposure to Argentina was $103 million,\nwhich was to non-sovereigncounterparties or   \nborrowers, and was primarily related to loans \nand lending commitments. In addition, our     \ntotal market exposure relating to Argentinian \nissuers as of March 2022 was $112 million,    \nprimarily to sovereign issuers. Such exposure \nconsisted of $83 million related to debt, $3  \nmillion related to credit derivatives and $26 \nmillion related to equities. Lebanon\u2019s        \nsovereign debt default and sharp currency     \ndepreciation have led to concerns about its   \nfinancial and political stability.

Zambia\u2019s sovereign debt     \ndefault and liquidity pressures aggravated by \nthe COVID-19pandemic have led to concerns     \nabout the country\u2019s financial stability. As of\nMarch 2022, our total credit exposure to      \nZambian counterparties or borrowers and our   \ntotal market exposure relating to Zambian     \nissuers was not material.

We combine top-      \ndownand bottom-upapproaches to manage and     \nmeasure operational risk. From a top-         \ndownperspective, our senior management        \nassesses firmwide and business-level          \noperational risk profiles. From a bottom-     \nupperspective, our first and second lines of  \ndefense are responsible for risk              \nidentification and risk management on a day-  \nto-daybasis, including escalating operational \nrisks and risk events to senior management. We\nmaintain a comprehensive control framework    \ndesigned to provide a well-controlled         \nenvironment to minimize operational risks. The\nFirmwide Operational Risk and Resilience      \nCommittee is responsible for overseeing       \noperational risk, and for ensuring our        \nbusiness and operational resilience. Our      \noperational risk management framework is      \ndesigned to comply with the operational risk  \nmeasurement rules under the Capital Framework \nand has evolved based on the changing needs of\nour businesses and regulatory guidance. We    \nhave established policies that require all    \nemployees to report and escalate operational  \nrisk events. When operational risk events are \nidentified, our policies require that the     \nevents be documented and analyzed to determine\nwhether changes are required in our systems   \nand/or processes to further mitigate the risk \nof future events. We use operational risk     \nmanagement applications to capture, analyze,  \naggregate and report operational risk event   \ndata and key metrics. One of our key risk     \nidentification and assessment tools is an     \noperational risk and control self-assessment  \nprocess, which is performed by our managers.  \nThis process consists of the identification   \nand rating of operational risks, on a forward-\nlooking basis, and the related controls. The  \nresults from this process are analyzed to     \nevaluate operational risk exposures and       \nidentify businesses, activities or products   \nwith heightened levels of operational risk.   \n                                             \n  151    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                             \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Climate  \nRisk Management We categorize climate risk    \ninto physical risk and transition risk.       \nPhysical risk is the risk that asset values   \nmay decline or operations may be disrupted as \na result of changes in the climate, while     \ntransition risk is the risk that asset values \nmay decline because of changes in climate     \npolicies or changes in the underlying economy \ndue to decarbonization. As a global financial \ninstitution, climate-related risks manifest in\ndifferent ways across our businesses and we   \nhave continued to make significant            \nenhancements to our climate risk management   \nframework, including steps to further         \nintegrate climate into our broader risk       \nmanagement processes. We have integrated      \noversight of climate-related risks into our   \nrisk management governance structure, from    \nsenior management to our Board and its        \ncommittees, including the Risk and Public     \nResponsibilities Committees. The Risk         \nCommittee of the Board oversees firmwide      \nfinancial and nonfinancial risks, which       \ninclude climate risk, and, as part of its     \noversight, receives updates on our risk       \nmanagement approach to climate risk, including\nour approaches towards scenario analysis and  \nintegration into existing risk management     \nprocesses. The Public Responsibilities        \nCommittee of the Board assists the Board in   \nits oversight of our firmwide sustainability  \nstrategy and sustainability issues affecting  \nus, including with respect to climate change. \nAs part of its oversight, the Public          \nResponsibilities Committee receives periodic  \nupdates on our sustainability strategy, and   \nalso periodically reviews our governance and  \nrelated policies and processes for            \nsustainability and climate change-related     \nrisks. Senior management within Risk is       \nresponsible for the development of our climate\nrisk program. We have begun incorporating     \nclimate risk into our credit evaluation and   \nunderwriting processes for select industries. \nClimate risk factors are now evaluated as part\nof transaction due diligence for select loan  \ncommitments. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Sustainability\u201d  \nin Part I, Item 1 and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part  \nI, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-Kfor           \ninformation about our sustainability          \ninitiatives, including in relation to climate \ntransition. Compliance Risk Management        \nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or       \nregulatory sanctions, material financial loss \nor damage to our reputation arising from our  \nfailure to comply with the requirements of    \napplicable laws, rules and regulations, and   \nour internal policies and procedures.         \nCompliance risk is inherent in all activities \nthrough which we conduct our businesses. Our  \nCompliance Risk Management Program,           \nadministered by Compliance, assesses our      \ncompliance, regulatory and reputational risk; \nmonitors for compliance with new or amended   \nlaws, rules and regulations; designs and      \nimplements controls, policies, procedures and \ntraining; conducts independent testing;       \ninvestigates, surveils and monitors for       \ncompliance risks and breaches; and leads our  \nresponses to regulatory examinations, audits  \nand inquiries. We monitor and review business \npractices to assess whether they meet or      \nexceed minimum regulatory and legal standards \nin all markets and jurisdictions in which we  \nconduct business. Conflicts Management        \nConflicts of interest and our approach to     \ndealing with them are fundamental to our      \nclient relationships, our reputation and our  \nlong-term success. The term \u201cconflict of      \ninterest\u201d does not have a universally accepted\nmeaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms\nwithin a business or between businesses. The  \nresponsibility for identifying potential      \nconflicts, as well as complying with our      \npolicies and procedures, is shared by all of  \nour employees. We have a multilayered approach\nto resolving conflicts and addressing         \nreputational risk. Our senior management      \noversees policies related to conflicts        \nresolution and, in conjunction with Conflicts \nResolution, Legal and Compliance, the Firmwide\nClient and Business Standards Committee, and  \nother internal committees, formulates         \npolicies, standards and principles, and       \nassists in making judgments regarding the     \nappropriate resolution of particular          \nconflicts. Resolving potential conflicts      \nnecessarily depends on the facts and          \ncircumstances of a particular situation and   \nthe application of experienced and informed   \njudgment. As a general matter, Conflicts      \nResolution reviews financing and advisory     \nassignments in Investment Banking and certain \nof our investing, lending and other           \nactivities. In addition, we have various      \ntransaction oversight committees, such as the \nFirmwide Capital, Commitments and Suitability \nCommittees and other committees that also     \nreview new underwritings, loans, investments  \nand structured products. These groups and     \ncommittees work with internal and external    \ncounsel and Compliance to evaluate and address\nany actual or potential conflicts. The head of\nConflicts Resolution reports to our chief     \nlegal officer, who reports to our chief       \nexecutive officer.                            \n                                             \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02022\u00a0Form 10-Q    154  \n                                             \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.
