(Group Inc. and, together with its\nconsolidated subsidiaries, the firm) announced\nthat it has reached settlements of\ngovernmental and regulatory investigations\nrelating to 1Malaysia Development Berhad\n(1MDB) with the U.S. Department of Justice\n(DOJ), the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission, the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, the New York State\nDepartment of Financial Services, the U.K.\nFinancial Conduct Authority, the U.K.\nPrudential Regulation Authority, the Singapore\nAttorney General\u2019s Chambers, the Singapore\nCommercial Affairs Department, the Monetary\nAuthority of Singapore and the Hong Kong\nSecurities and Futures Commission.\n\nGroup Inc. has agreed to enter into a three-\nyear deferred prosecution agreement with the\nDOJ, in which a charge against the firm, one\ncount of conspiracy to violate the Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), will be\nfiled and later dismissed if the firm abides\nby the terms of the agreement. In addition,\nGroup Inc.\u2019s subsidiary in Malaysia, Goldman\nSachs (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (GS Malaysia), has\nagreed to plead guilty to one count of\nconspiracy to violate the FCPA. The firm will\npay total penalties, after crediting, of\napproximately $2.6 billion in connection with\nthe settlements. A separate obligation to pay\n$606 million in disgorgement has been credited\nand satisfied as a result of the firm\u2019s\nearlier settlement with the Government of\nMalaysia, in which the firm paid a total of\n$2.5 billion, in addition to providing a $1.4\nbillion asset recovery guarantee. This brings\nthe total payments in connection with\ngovernmental and regulatory settlements\nrelating to 1MDB to an aggregate of\napproximately $5.1 billion.\n\nIn connection with the settlements announced\ntoday, the firm will increase its provisions\nfor litigation and regulatory proceedings for\nthe third quarter of 2020 by $250 million,\nwhich will be reflected in its financial\nstatements to be filed with its Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for the period ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, and which will reduce its\npreviously reported net earnings for the\nquarter by the same amount.\n\nThe firm has been working to secure necessary\nexemptions and authorizations from regulators\nso that the settlements do not impact the\nfirm\u2019s activities or the services that it\nprovides to clients. The firm has already\nsubmitted its application to the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor (DOL) to maintain its\nstatus as a qualified professional asset\nmanager (QPAM), and expects to obtain the\nexemption before the sentencing of GS\nMalaysia.\n\nThe settlements do not resolve the civil\nlitigation against the firm relating to 1MDB,\nfor which the firm\u2019s motions to dismiss are\npending.\n\nThe information under Item 2.02 of this Form\n8-K shall be deemed \u201cfiled\u201d for purposes of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange\nAct).\n                                              \n  Item\u00a07.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.         \n                                              \nIn connection with the settlements, the Board\nof Directors of Group Inc. has released a\nstatement, a copy of which is attached as\nExhibit 99.1.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements\n\nThis Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit\n99.1, contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the safe harbor\nprovisions of the U.S. Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking\nstatements are not historical facts, but\ninstead represent only the firm\u2019s beliefs\nregarding future events, many of which, by\ntheir nature, are inherently uncertain and\noutside the firm\u2019s control. The firm has\nincluded in this Report on Form 8-K, and\ndirectors, officers and employees of the firm\nmay provide, information about the application\nfor and pursuit of exemptions and\nauthorizations from regulatory authorities,\nincluding the DOL, and with respect to\nremediation activities and the progress or the\nstatus of remediation activities. The\nstatements with respect to the pursuit of the\nexemptions and authorizations and the\nremediation activities are forward-looking\nstatements, based on the firm\u2019s current\nexpectations regarding the prospects for\nreceiving the exemptions and authorizations\nand the current remediation efforts and plans.\nAccordingly, the firm\u2019s ability to receive the\nexemptions and authorizations and complete the\nremediation activities, may change, possibly\nmaterially, from what is currently expected.\nFor a discussion of some of the other risks\nand important factors that could affect these\nforward-looking statements, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nin Part I, Item 1A of the firm\u2019s Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2019 and Part II, Item 1A of the firm\u2019s\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended June 30, 2020.\n                                              \n   Item\u00a09.01 Financial Statements and         \n   Exhibits.                                  \n                                              \n(d) Exhibits.\n                                              \n        Statement of the Board of Directors   \n        of Group Inc. dated October\u00a022,\u00a0      \n  99.1  2020.                                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nExhibit 99.1 is being furnished pursuant to\nItem 7.01 of Form 8-K and the information\nincluded therein shall not be deemed \u201cfiled\u201d\nfor purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act\nor otherwise subject to the liabilities under\nthat Section and shall not be deemed to be\nincorporated by reference into any filing of\nGroup Inc. under the Securities Act of 1933 or\nthe Exchange Act.\n                                              \n       Pursuant to Rule 406 of Regulation     \n  101  S-T, the cover page information is     \n       formatted in iXBRL (Inline eXtensible  \n       Business Reporting Language).          \n                                              \n                                              \n  104  Cover Page Interactive Data File       \n       (formatted in iXBRL in Exhibit 101).   \n                                              \n                                              \n                  SIGNATURE                   \n                                              \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly\ncaused this report to be signed on its behalf\nby the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n                                              \n                 THE                          \n  Date:          GOLDMAN    /s/               \n  Octob\u2026         SACHS      Stephen           \n  22,\u00a0           GROUP,     M.                \n  2020      By:  INC.
