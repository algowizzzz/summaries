    "content": "TORONTO\n,\nMarch 26, 2025\n/CNW/ - Today, CIBC launched its first annual CIBC Ambitions Index, an in-depth report exploring Canadians' current goals and ambitions – big or small – across all areas of life.\n\"At CIBC, we believe that understanding the ambitions of Canadians is essential to fulfilling our purpose of helping make ambitions real,\" said\nStephen Forbes\n, Executive Vice-President, Purpose, Brand and Corporate Affairs, CIBC. \"The CIBC Ambitions Index not only sheds light on the goals that matter most to Canadians across ages and geographies, but also reinforces our commitment to supporting them on their journeys towards achieving those ambitions.\"\nAnnually, the CIBC Ambitions Index will track the goals and ambitions of Canadians, the progress they've made, and what's holding them back. The index builds a clear view of what matters most to Canadians and where their efforts are focused at different stages in life. While money and finances play a role in achieving ambition, this report explores all aspects of Canadians' ambitions, including health and wellness, personal relationships, travel and leisure, pursuing a passion, education and learning, career development, social impact and environmental sustainability.\nIn recent years, Canadians have been navigating through ongoing economic and geopolitical instability. Despite continued uncertainty, however, as we arrive at the quarter century Canadians have some positive reflections on their ambitions and their efforts to achieve them. In fact, 78% of Canadians say their ambitions have gained importance in light of current economic challenges.\nKey takeaways from the inaugural report include:\nCommon ground\n:\nFrom coast to coast and across generations,\nCanadians have many common ambitions\n– with goals in the areas of health and wellness (\n57%\n), financial stability and growth (\n54%\n), and personal relationships with family and friends (\n49%\n) topping the list nationally. This demonstrates a balanced approach of blending practical ambitions with those more personal and meaningful.\nProgress with purpose\n:\nDespite uncertainties, Canadians are making headway.\n68% made progress towards their ambition in the last year\nand three in four Canadians are happy with the progress they've made. But the quest for quicker results is palpable as\n58%\nare only somewhat satisfied with the progress they've made.\n61%\nare optimistic about unlocking more achievements next year.\nCanadians' view of wellness is evolving:\nCanadians are\nprioritizing their personal well-being\nand work-life balance over a commitment to career advancement.\n91%\nof Canadians state that a balanced work-life lifestyle is essential to happiness, while fewer than half (\n49%)\nexpress a commitment to career advancement.\n91%\nalso say maintaining a healthy lifestyle is crucial to their overall wellbeing, and\n85%\nprioritize their physical health and regularly engage in fitness activities.\nCelebrate your success\n:\nThose who plan, review and celebrate their journey are more likely to advance their ambitions, yet many aren't doing this.\nAt least quarterly\n, only\n35%\nof Canadians set goals,\n40%\nreview their progress, and only\n29%\ncelebrate their milestones.\nThe inaugural CIBC Ambitions Index serves as a vital resource for understanding Canadian ambitions. This report not only highlights the common threads that unite us but also illustrates the unique differences. In future years, it will help reveal the evolving landscape and key trends that define our ambitions. As CIBC continues to support Canadians in their pursuit of their goals, we remain committed to providing the tools, resources, and guidance necessary to help individuals navigate their journeys.\nThe full CIBC Ambitions Index can be found at\nthoughtleadership.cibc.com/ambitionsindex\nDisclaimer\nThe findings are from an Ipsos poll conducted\nbetween October 10 and 17, 2024\n, on behalf of CIBC. For this survey, a sample of 2,500 Canadians aged 18+ were interviewed. Sample was sourced from the Ipsos panel. Weighting was employed to balance demographics to ensure that the sample's composition reflects that of the adult population according to Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. The precision of Ipsos polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll is accurate to within ±2.4 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, had all Canadians been polled. The credibility interval will be wider among subsets of the population.\nNote: Ipsos conducted a validation poll in\nFebruary 2025\nfor CIBC to verify the original study's findings amid recent economic and geopolitical shifts. The survey interviewed 1,000 Canadian adults (18+) between\nFebruary 13-18, 2025\n, using a sample from the Ipsos panel. Demographic weighting was applied to ensure the sample accurately represents the adult population as per Census data.\nAbout CIBC\nCIBC is a leading North American financial institution with 14 million personal banking, business, public sector and institutional clients.

    "content": "TORONTO\n,\nMarch 24, 2025\n/CNW/ - A new CIBC poll finds that amidst the volatility in inflation and higher costs of living, mortgage holders are taking proactive measures to mitigate financial strain, with the majority feeling confident in their ability to handle their mortgage payments and make their budgets work.\nIn fact, 64% of variable rate mortgage holders remain unaffected, reporting little to no impact on their standard of living, as do 59% of those expecting higher renewal rates.\n\"As mortgage rates are declining, it's encouraging to see that despite continued financial pressures, the majority of homeowners remain confident in their ability to manage their living expenses,\" said\nDaniel Rethazy\n, Senior Vice-President, Personal Lending, CIBC.\nHomeowners determined to navigate budget challenges amidst fluctuating economic conditions\nSix in 10 homeowners renewing their mortgage in the next two years anticipate higher interest rates, with the average expected increase between 1% and 2%. Amidst this backdrop, mortgage holders have a number of key concerns including inflation and living costs (94%), broader economic conditions (89%), interest rates (85%) and potential US tariffs (80%), with concerns about election outcomes in\nCanada\nnot far behind at 70%.\nDetermined to make budgets work, over half of renewers expecting a higher rate are tightening their belts by opting for more affordable shopping options and cutting back on discretionary spending such as travel and entertainment (57%). Many are also shopping for better mortgage rates (42%), seeking additional income sources (24%), and making lump sum payments towards their mortgages (19%).\n\"At CIBC, we understand that navigating the current economic uncertainty and rising cost of living can create stress for Canadians as they manage their mortgage commitments and household budgets,\" said\nDaniel Rethazy\n, Senior Vice-President, Personal Lending, CIBC. \"We are committed to providing Canadian homeowners with personalized solutions and advice, to help them manage their mortgage payments with confidence and to support their overall financial well-being.\"\nOther Key Findings:\nNearly two-thirds (64%) of those renewing their mortgages in the next two years plan to secure fixed-rate mortgages, while 17% lean towards variable rates, and 19% remain undecided.\nAmidst fluctuating mortgage interest rates, nearly two-thirds (64%) of Canadian variable rate mortgage holders report little to no impact on their standard of living. However, the remaining one-third experience moderate to severe financial strain.\n55% of Canadians are homeowners. Despite economic uncertainties, homeownership remains a highly valued milestone, with nine in ten homeowners expressing pride in their achievement.\nDisclaimer\nThe findings are from an Ipsos poll conducted\nbetween January 20 and 28, 2025\n, on behalf of CIBC.

Under his leadership, CIBC has become a modern, relationship-oriented bank recognized for delivering superior client focus, consistent and reliable strategic growth, and top-tier shareholder returns.\n\"It has been an honour to lead CIBC and work alongside such a dedicated and purpose-led team,\" said Mr. Dodig. \"Together, we have built a strong foundation for the future, with a clear and consistent strategy focused on client relationships, financial strength, innovation, sustainability and genuine community engagement. I am very proud of all that we have accomplished together and believe the time is right to hand the baton to Harry. I look forward to working closely with Harry and our entire leadership team as we continue delivering exceptional value for our clients, shareholders, and communities.\"\nOver the past decade, CIBC built a highly connected and client-focused team and culture that is guided by a common purpose of helping make ambitions real, renewed its brand, modernized its workplaces, achieved best-in-class employee experience scores, and delivered the strongest client experience gains among Canadian banks. In addition, the bank has taken a leading role in fostering inclusion, furthered its commitment to communities through the launch of the CIBC Foundation, and became a North American leader in sustainability.\n\"Victor's tenure as President and CEO has been marked by a relentless focus on our clients and an unwavering commitment to transforming CIBC into the modern, relationship-oriented bank it is today, with a connected culture that brings the best of CIBC to its clients,\" said\nKate Stevenson\n, Chair of the Board of Directors. \"Victor led key strategic acquisitions including the acquisition of PrivateBancorp, Inc., which significantly enhanced CIBC's U.S. footprint in Commercial Banking and Wealth Management. He also led the acquisition of Costco's Canadian credit card portfolio which added over two million clients to CIBC, including many mass affluent and business banking clients. In addition, he led transformative investments in digital banking and technology to modernize the bank. The result is a strategic platform for growth that will benefit stakeholders for years to come.\"\n\"We are thankful for his incredible contributions and appreciate the care he has invested in partnering with the board as we prepare to transition to the next generation of leadership.\"\nHarry Culham Named Chief Operating Officer and incoming President and CEO\nEffective\nApril 1, 2025\n, all of CIBC's operating businesses will report to Mr. Culham to help facilitate the leadership transition and continued strong focus on clients and performance.

He then gained extensive experience in senior banking roles in\nEurope\nand\nAsia\nbefore rejoining CIBC in 2008, ultimately taking on the leadership of CIBC's global Capital Markets business in 2015.\nMr. Culham's global experience working with clients across borders was instrumental in providing a broad global perspective that he has brought to CIBC's Capital Markets business, and he has been a valued member of CIBC's Executive Committee for the past decade. Under his leadership, the business has diversified with robust growth in\nNorth America\nand with global reach to better meet the changing needs of clients in an evolving marketplace, while in parallel re-orienting the business around deep client relationships in key growth sectors. The result is a transformed business that produces consistent, sustainable growth with reduced earnings volatility and strong credit quality with a highly connected culture.\nMr. Culham has also been responsible for leading and optimizing several areas of the bank including CIBC Caribbean, CIBC Mellon, and the Strategic Client Office. He has also led CIBC's Enterprise Strategy and Corporate Development function and, most recently Global Asset Management.

He holds a degree from the\nUniversity of British Columbia's\nSauder School\nof Business and is a Leslie Wong Fellow.\n\"Harry is a proven leader who has worked alongside me, our board and the rest of our CIBC team to build the bank we are today,\" said Mr. Dodig. \"His client focus, inclusive leadership and track record of performance and consistency position him perfectly to take the bank forward and build on the momentum we have established. I look forward to working closely with him over the coming months.\"\n\"I'm delighted to take on these new responsibilities in service of CIBC's clients, employees, business partners, shareholders and the communities we serve,\" said Mr. Culham. \"I am enormously proud of the work we have done under Victor's leadership and am excited to build on our current momentum to fully realize the value of the strategy we have put in place over the past several years.\"\n\"Harry's approach to creating shareholder value through disciplined execution, prudent and risk-controlled growth, and a focus on clients are ideally suited to furthering CIBC's momentum,\" said Ms. Stevenson. \"Succession planning and talent development at all levels of the organization have been an ongoing and continuous focus for our board.

All such statements are made pursuant to the \"safe harbour\" provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under applicable Canadian and US securities legislation, including the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements in this Report related to our purpose – to help make our clients' ambitions a reality, priorities, targets, metrics, sustainability commitments and goals (including our\n$300 billion\nby 2030 sustainable finance goal, the implementation and update of our Sustainable Finance Methodology, our 2050 net-zero ambition, and reducing operational GHG emissions), as well as our economic and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) related impacts and objectives, including but not limited to, sustainable financing, data ethics, inclusion, employee engagement, making a difference in the community, inclusive banking, and accelerating climate action. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words \"believe\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"forecast\", \"target\", \"predict\", \"commit\", \"ambition\", \"goal\", \"strive\", \"project\", \"objective\", and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as \"will\", \"may\", \"should\", \"would\", and \"could\". By their nature, these statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may be general or specific, which give rise to the possibility that our predictions, forecasts, projections, expectations, or conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that our assumptions may not be correct, and that our priorities, targets, commitments, and goals, and economic and ESG-related impacts and objectives will not be achieved. As we work to advance our ESG goals, external factors outside of CIBC's reasonable control may act as constraints on achieving these goals. These factors include: trade policies and tensions, including tariffs; inflationary pressures in the U.S.; global supply-chain disruptions; geopolitical risk, including from the war in\nUkraine\nand conflict in the\nMiddle East\n; the occurrence, continuance, or intensification of public health emergencies, such as the impact of post-pandemic hybrid work arrangements, and any related government policies and actions; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to us and our affiliates or associates; our ability to implement various sustainability-related initiatives internally and with our clients under expected time frames; our ability to scale our sustainable finance products and services; the availability of comprehensive and high-quality GHG emissions data (including from CIBC's clients) and standardization of ESG-related measurement methodologies; the evolution of our lending portfolios over time; the need for active and continuing participation, cooperation, and collaboration from various stakeholders (including enterprises, financial institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and individuals); deployment of new technologies and industry-specific solutions; the evolution of consumer behaviour; varying decarbonization efforts across economies; the need for thoughtful climate policies globally; the challenges of balancing interim emissions goals with an orderly transition; and the continuing development and evolution of regulations, guidelines, principles, and frameworks internationally and CIBC's compliance thereto, which could lead to us to being subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings, the potential outcome of which could include regulatory restrictions, penalties, and fines. These and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements and may require CIBC to adapt its initiatives and activities or adjust its commitments, metrics, targets, and goals. The forward-looking statements in this Report are presented for the purpose of assisting clients and others in understanding our objectives and strategic priorities, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement except as required by law.\nAbout CIBC\nCIBC is a leading North American financial institution with 14 million personal banking, business, public sector and institutional clients.
