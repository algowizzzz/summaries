All such statements are made pursuant to the \"safe harbour\" provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under applicable Canadian and US securities legislation, including the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements in this Report related to our purpose – to help make our clients' ambitions a reality, priorities, targets, metrics, sustainability commitments and goals (including our\n$300 billion\nby 2030 sustainable finance goal, the implementation and update of our Sustainable Finance Methodology, our 2050 net-zero ambition, and reducing operational GHG emissions), as well as our economic and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) related impacts and objectives, including but not limited to, sustainable financing, data ethics, inclusion, employee engagement, making a difference in the community, inclusive banking, and accelerating climate action. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words \"believe\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"forecast\", \"target\", \"predict\", \"commit\", \"ambition\", \"goal\", \"strive\", \"project\", \"objective\", and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as \"will\", \"may\", \"should\", \"would\", and \"could\". By their nature, these statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may be general or specific, which give rise to the possibility that our predictions, forecasts, projections, expectations, or conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that our assumptions may not be correct, and that our priorities, targets, commitments, and goals, and economic and ESG-related impacts and objectives will not be achieved. As we work to advance our ESG goals, external factors outside of CIBC's reasonable control may act as constraints on achieving these goals. These factors include: trade policies and tensions, including tariffs; inflationary pressures in the U.S.; global supply-chain disruptions; geopolitical risk, including from the war in\nUkraine\nand conflict in the\nMiddle East\n; the occurrence, continuance, or intensification of public health emergencies, such as the impact of post-pandemic hybrid work arrangements, and any related government policies and actions; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to us and our affiliates or associates; our ability to implement various sustainability-related initiatives internally and with our clients under expected time frames; our ability to scale our sustainable finance products and services; the availability of comprehensive and high-quality GHG emissions data (including from CIBC's clients) and standardization of ESG-related measurement methodologies; the evolution of our lending portfolios over time; the need for active and continuing participation, cooperation, and collaboration from various stakeholders (including enterprises, financial institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and individuals); deployment of new technologies and industry-specific solutions; the evolution of consumer behaviour; varying decarbonization efforts across economies; the need for thoughtful climate policies globally; the challenges of balancing interim emissions goals with an orderly transition; and the continuing development and evolution of regulations, guidelines, principles, and frameworks internationally and CIBC's compliance thereto, which could lead to us to being subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings, the potential outcome of which could include regulatory restrictions, penalties, and fines. These and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements and may require CIBC to adapt its initiatives and activities or adjust its commitments, metrics, targets, and goals. The forward-looking statements in this Report are presented for the purpose of assisting clients and others in understanding our objectives and strategic priorities, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement except as required by law.\nAbout CIBC\nCIBC is a leading North American financial institution with 14 million personal banking, business, public sector and institutional clients.
