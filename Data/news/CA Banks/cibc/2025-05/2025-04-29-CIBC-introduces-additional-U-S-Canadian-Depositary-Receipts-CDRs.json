Introduced to investors over three years ago, CIBC has a total of 101 CDRs, spanning four countries.\nCDRs make it easy to invest in many of the world's largest companies – in Canadian dollars. Offered at a fraction of the price per share of the underlying reference share, and with a built-in notional currency hedge, CDRs provide investors with affordable access to global stocks while mitigating the currency risk associated with global investing.\nCIBC's latest CDRs are based on well-known U.S. companies from sectors that are new to CIBC's platform, allowing Canadian investors to diversify their portfolios throughout investment cycles. The 15 CDRs are listed below with corresponding Cboe Canada ticker symbols:\nAbbott Labs CDR (CAD Hedged) – ABT\nAmgen CDR (CAD Hedged) – AMGN\nAutoZone CDR (CAD Hedged) – AZO\nCharles Schwab CDR (CAD Hedged) – SCHW\nFiserv CDR (CAD Hedged) – FI\nGE Vernova CDR (CAD Hedged) – GEV\nGilead Sciences CDR (CAD Hedged) – GILD\nKKR CDR (CAD Hedged) – KKR\nMorgan Stanley CDR (CAD Hedged) – MS\nNextEra Energy CDR (CAD Hedged) – NEE\nPepsi CDR (CAD Hedged) – PEP\nS&P Global CDR (CAD Hedged) – SPGI\nTJX CDR (CAD Hedged) – TJX\nUnion Pacific CDR (CAD Hedged) – UNP\nWaste Management CDR (CAD Hedged) – WAST\nThese 15 will add to the\nexisting lineup of CDRs\nwhich are currently available for trading.\nThe Prospectus Supplement for these latest Series of CDRs has been filed on SEDAR+ at\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n.
