Our complete First Quarter 2025 Report to Shareholders, including our unaudited interim financial statements for the period ended January 31, 2025, can also be found on the SEDAR+ website atwww.sedarplus.caand on the EDGAR section of the SEC's website atwww.sec.gov.

This quarter's net income includes an impairment loss of$1,355 millionrelated to the announced sale of the banking operations inColombia,Costa RicaandPanamato Davivienda. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were$0.66, compared to$1.68in the same period a year ago.\n\nAdjusted net income(1)for the first quarter was$2,362 millionand diluted EPS(1)was$1.76, up from$1.69last year. Adjusted return on equity(1)was 11.8% compared to 11.9% a year ago.\n\"Our results this quarter demonstrate the value of our diversified franchise and continued focus on deepening relationships with clients across our footprint,\" saidScott Thomson, President and CEO of Scotiabank. \"We are encouraged by the progress towards our stated medium-term financial objectives and remain focused on supporting our clients as they navigate through this challenging period of economic uncertainty.\"\nCanadian Banking delivered adjusted earnings(1)of$914 million, down 6% year-over-year, as higher revenue from solid loan and deposit growth were more than offset by higher provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses.\nInternational Banking generated adjusted earnings(1)of$692 million, down 7% year-over-year, reflecting solid but more normalized business banking and capital markets performance relative to the record results in the same quarter last year. Strong 6% quarter-over-quarter earnings growth driven by solid revenue growth, expense management, and the favourable impact of foreign exchange, was partly offset by higher provision for credit losses. Positive operating leverage continues to reflect the impact of successful productivity initiatives in the region.\nGlobal Wealth Management adjusted earnings(1)were$416 million, up 22% year-over-year driven by solid revenue growth from higher mutual fund fees, brokerage revenues, and net interest income across the Canadian and International wealth businesses. Additionally, assets under management of$396 billiongrew 16% year-over-year.\nGlobal Banking and Markets had a strong start to the year with earnings of$517 million, up 33% compared to the prior year. The results were driven by strong performance across our capital markets business as well as higher underwriting and advisory fees in our corporate and investment banking business.\nThe Bank reported a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio(3)of 12.9%.\n\"Consistent with our strategy, we have recently executed on initiatives to generate additional profitability in our priority North American markets and to simplify our International Banking portfolio, with the closing of our KeyCorp investment inthe United Statesand the announcement of our agreement to sell ourColombiaandCentral Americaoperations,\" continued Mr. Thomson.\n__________________________________\n(1)\nRefer to Non-GAAP Measures section starting on page 5.\n(2)\nRefer to page 51 of the Management's Discussion & Analysis in the Bank's First Quarter 2025 Report to Shareholders, available on www.sedarplus.ca, for an explanation of the composition of the measure.

The new methodology includes updates related to the Bank's funds transfer pricing, head office expense allocations, and allocations between business segments. Prior period results and ratios for each segment have been revised to conform with the current period's methodology.  Further details on the changes are as follows:\nCanadian Banking\nQ1 2025 vs Q1 2024Net income attributable to equity holders was$913 million, compared to$973 million. Adjusted net income attributable to equity holders was$914 million, a decrease of$60 millionor 6%. The decrease was due primarily to higher provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses, partly offset by higher revenues.\nQ1 2025 vs Q4 2024Net income attributable to equity holders decreased$21 millionor 2%. The decline was due primarily to higher provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses, partly offset by higher revenues.\nInternational Banking\nQ1 2025 vs Q1 2024Net income attributable to equity holders decreased$62 millionor 9% to$651 million. Adjusted net income attributable to equity holders decreased$62 millionor 9% to$657 million. The decrease was driven by lower net interest income, higher provision for credit losses, higher income taxes and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. This was partly offset by higher non-interest income and lower non-interest expenses.\nQ1 2025 vs Q4 2024Net income attributable to equity holders increased$51 millionor 8%. Adjusted net income attributable to equity holders increased$51 millionor 8%. The increase was driven by higher non-interest income, net interest income and the positive impact of foreign currency translation. This was partly offset by higher provision for credit losses, non-interest expenses, and income taxes.\nFinancial Performance on a Constant Dollar Basis\nThe discussion below on the results of operations is on a constant dollar basis. Under the constant dollar basis, prior period amounts are recalculated using current period average foreign currency rates, which is a non-GAAP financial measure (refer to Non-GAAP Measures starting on page 5). The Bank believes that constant dollar is useful for readers in assessing ongoing business performance without the impact of foreign currency translation and is used by management to assess the performance of the business segment. Ratios are on a reported basis.\nQ1 2025 vs Q1 2024Net income attributable to equity holders was$651 million, down$52 millionor 7%. Adjusted net income attributable to equity holders was$657 million, down$51 millionor 7%. The decrease was driven by higher provision for credit losses, non-interest expenses, lower net interest income and higher income taxes. This was partly offset by higher non-interest income.\nQ1 2025 vs Q4 2024Net income attributable to equity holders increased$32 millionor 5%. Adjusted net income attributable to equity holders increased$32 millionor 5%. The increase was due primarily to higher non-interest income. This was partly offset by higher provision for credit losses, income taxes, non-interest expenses and lower net interest income.\nGlobal Wealth Management\nQ1 2025 vs Q1 2024Net income attributable to equity holders was$407 million, an increase of$77 millionor 23%. Adjusted net income attributable to equity holders was$414 million, up$78 millionor 23%. The increase was due primarily to higher mutual fund fees, brokerage revenues, and net interest income across the Canadian and International wealth businesses. This was partly offset by higher non-interest expenses due largely to volume-related expenses.\nQ1 2025 vs Q4 2024Net income attributable to equity holders increased$27 millionor 7%. Adjusted net income attributable to equity holders increased$28 millionor 7%, due primarily to higher brokerage revenues, mutual fund fees, and net interest income, partly offset by higher non-interest expenses.\nGlobal Banking and Markets\nQ1 2025 vs Q1 2024Net income attributable to equity holders was$517 millioncompared to$388 million, an increase of$129 millionor 33%. The increase was driven primarily by higher net interest income and non-interest income, partly offset by higher non-interest expenses and higher provision for credit losses.\nQ1 2025 vs Q4 2024Net income attributable to equity holders was$517 millioncompared to$347 million, an increase of$170 millionor 49%. The increase was driven primarily by higher net interest income and non-interest income, partly offset by higher non-interest expenses.\nOther\nQ1 2025 vs Q1 2024Net loss attributable to equity holders was$1,341 millionwhich included an impairment loss of$1,164 millionrelated to the announced sale of the banking operations inColombia,Costa RicaandPanama, compared to a net loss of$230 millionin the prior year. The adjusted net loss attributable to equity holders was$177 millioncompared to an adjusted net loss of$230 millionin the prior year. The lower loss of$53 millionwas due to higher revenues, partly offset by higher expenses and higher income taxes. The higher revenues were driven mainly by higher net interest income related to asset/liability management activities which benefitted from lower interest rates, higher revenue from investments in associated corporations related to the KeyCorp acquisition, and a lower taxable equivalent basis (TEB) gross-up as the Bank no longer claims the dividend received deduction on Canadian shares that are mark-to-market property. The TEB gross-up is offset in income taxes.\nQ1 2025 vs Q4 2024Net loss attributable to equity holders increased$722 millionfrom the prior quarter and included the impairment loss related to the announced sale of the banking operations inColombia,Costa RicaandPanama. The adjusted net loss attributable to equity holders decreased$25 millionfrom the prior quarter. The lower loss was due to higher revenues, which were partially offset by higher expenses and higher income taxes. The higher revenues were due primarily to higher net interest income from asset/liability management activities which benefitted from lower interest rates, and higher revenue from investments in associated corporations related to the KeyCorp acquisition.\nCredit risk\nProvision for credit losses\nQ1 2025 vs Q1 2024The provision for credit losses was$1,162 million, compared to$962 million, an increase of$200 million. The provision for credit losses ratio increased by 10 basis points to 60 basis points.\nThe provision for credit losses on performing loans was$98 million, compared to$20 million. The provision this quarter was due primarily to credit migration mainly in retail unsecured lines, corporate and commercial portfolios along with the continued unfavourable macroeconomic outlook including the uncertainties related to the impact of tariffs inCanadaandMexico.\nThe provision for credit losses on impaired loans was$1,064 millioncompared to$942 million, an increase of$122 million. The provision for credit losses ratio on impaired loans was 55 basis points, an increase of six basis points. The provision this quarter was due primarily to higher Canadian retail formations across most products, as well as higher Canadian commercial provisions, mainly related to one account.\nQ1 2025 vs Q4 2024The provision for credit losses was$1,162 million, compared to$1,030 million. The provision for credit losses ratio increased by six basis points to 60 basis points.\nProvision for credit losses on performing loans was$98 million, compared to a net reversal of$13 million. The provision this period was due primarily to credit migration mainly in retail unsecured lines, corporate and commercial portfolios as well as the continued unfavourable macroeconomic outlook including the uncertainties related to the impact of tariffs inCanadaandMexico.\nThe provision for credit losses on impaired loans was$1,064 millioncompared to$1,043 million, an increase of$21 millionor 2%. The provision for credit losses ratio on impaired loans remained unchanged at 55 basis points. The provision this quarter is due primarily to higher provisions in Canadian and International retail portfolios, partly offset by lower provisions in the International commercial portfolio.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe total allowance for credit losses as atJanuary 31, 2025was$7,080 millioncompared to$6,736 millionin the prior quarter. The allowance for credit losses ratio was 91 basis points, an increase of three basis points. The allowance for credit losses for loans was$6,857 million, an increase of$321 millioncompared to last quarter. The increase was driven by higher allowance for credit losses on impaired loans due primarily to higher provisions in Canadian Banking and International retail portfolios as well as higher allowances on performing loans in commercial, corporate and Canadian retail portfolios due to credit migration and the continued unfavourable macroeconomic outlook. The impact of foreign currency translation increased the allowance by$155 million.\nThe allowance for credit losses on performing loans was higher at$4,667 millioncompared to$4,482 millioncompared to last quarter. The allowance for performing loans ratio was 63 basis points. The increase was due primarily to credit migration in corporate, Canadian retail and commercial portfolios as well as continued unfavourable macroeconomic outlook. The impact of foreign currency translation increased the allowance by$101 million.\nThe allowance on impaired loans increased by$136 millionto$2,190 millionfrom$2,054 millionlast quarter. The allowance for impaired loans ratio was 28 basis points, an increase of one basis point. The increase was due primarily to higher provisions in Canadian Banking and International retail portfolios. The impact of foreign currency translation increased the allowance by$54 million.\nImpaired loans\nGross impaired loans increased to$7,064 millionas atJanuary 31, 2025, from$6,739 millionlast quarter. The increase was due primarily to the impact of foreign currency translation and higher formations in International retail mainly inMexicoandChile. The gross impaired loan ratio was 91 basis points, an increase of three basis points from last quarter.\nNet impaired loans in Canadian Banking were$1,588 million, an increase of$87 millionfrom last quarter, due primarily to new formations partly offset by higher provisions.

Net impaired loans in Global Banking and Markets were$136 million, an increase of$3 millionfrom last quarter due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Net impaired loans in Global Wealth Management were$49 million, a decrease of$1 millionfrom last quarter.\nNet impaired loans as a percentage of loans and acceptances were 0.63%, an increase of two basis points from last quarter.\nCapital Ratios\nThe Bank's CET1 capital ratio(1)was 12.9% as atJanuary 31, 2025, a decrease of approximately 20 basis points from the prior quarter, due primarily to the close of the Bank's investment in KeyCorp and impairment loss related to the announced sale of the banking operations inColombia,Costa RicaandPanamato Davivienda, partly offset by strong internal generation and the Bank's risk-weighted asset optimization activities.\nThe Bank's Tier 1 capital ratio(1)was 15.1% as atJanuary 31, 2025, an increase of approximately 10 basis points from the prior quarter, mainly from the issuance of USD$1 billionof Limited Recourse Capital Notes, partly offset by the above noted impacts to the CET1 ratio.\nThe Bank's Total capital ratio(1)was 16.8% as atJanuary 31, 2025, an increase of approximately 10 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily from the above noted impacts to the Tier 1 capital ratio.\nThe Leverage ratio(2)was 4.4% as atJanuary 31, 2025, largely unchanged from the prior quarter, as the higher Tier 1 capital issuance was offset by higher leverage exposures.\nThe TLAC and TLAC Leverage ratios(3)were 28.8% and 8.5% respectively, as atJanuary 31, 2025, representing decreases of approximately 90 and 30 basis points from the prior quarter, mainly from lower available TLAC.\nAs atJanuary 31, 2025, the CET1, Tier 1, Total capital, Leverage, TLAC and TLAC Leverage ratios were well above OSFI's minimum capital ratios.\n___________________________________\n(1)\nThe regulatory capital ratios are based on Basel III requirements as determined in accordance with OSFI Guideline - Capital Adequacy Requirements (November 2023).\n(2)\nThis measure has been disclosed in this document in accordance with OSFI Guideline – Leverage Requirements (February 2023).\n(3)\nThis measure has been disclosed in this document in accordance with OSFI Guideline – Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (September 2018).\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe Bank uses a number of financial measures and ratios to assess its performance, as well as the performance of its operating segments. Some of these financial measures and ratios are presented on a non-GAAP basis and are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which are based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), are not defined by GAAP and do not have standardized meanings and therefore might not be comparable to similar financial measures and ratios disclosed by other issuers. The Bank believes that non-GAAP measures and ratios are useful as they provide readers with a better understanding of how management assesses performance. These non-GAAP measures and ratios are used throughout this report and defined below.\nAdjusted results and diluted earnings per share\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of GAAP reported financial results to non-GAAP adjusted financial results. Management considers both reported and adjusted results and measures useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance. Adjusted results and measures remove certain specified items from revenue, non-interest expenses, income taxes and non-controlling interests. Presenting results on both a reported basis and adjusted basis allows readers to assess the impact of certain items on results for the periods presented, and to better assess results and trends excluding those items that may not be reflective of ongoing business performance.\nReconciliation of reported and adjusted results and diluted earnings per share\nFor the three months ended\nJanuary 31\nOctober 31\nJanuary 31\n($ millions)\n2025\n2024\n2024\nReported Results\nNet interest income\n$\n5,173\n$\n4,923\n$\n4,773\nNon-interest income\n4,199\n3,603\n3,660\nTotal revenue\n9,372\n8,526\n8,433\nProvision for credit losses\n1,162\n1,030\n962\nNon-interest expenses\n6,491\n5,296\n4,739\nIncome before taxes\n1,719\n2,200\n2,732\nIncome tax expense\n726\n511\n533\nNet income\n$\n993\n$\n1,689\n$\n2,199\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries (NCI)\n(154)\n47\n25\nNet income attributable to equity holders\n1,147\n1,642\n2,174\nNet income attributable to preferred shareholders and other equity\ninstrument holders\n122\n121\n108\nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n$\n1,025\n$\n1,521\n$\n2,066\nDiluted earnings per share(in dollars)\n$\n0.66\n$\n1.22\n$\n1.68\nWeighted average number of diluted common shares\noutstanding(millions)\n1,250\n1,243\n1,221\nAdjustments\nAdjusting items impacting non-interest expenses (Pre-tax)\n(a) Divestitures and wind-down of operations\n$\n1,362\n$\n–\n$\n–\n(b) Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n18\n19\n18\n(c) Restructuring charge and severance provisions\n–\n53\n–\n(d) Impairment of non-financial assets\n–\n440\n–\nTotal non-interest expense adjusting items (Pre-tax)\n1,380\n512\n18\nTotal impact of adjusting items on net income before taxes\n1,380\n512\n18\nImpact of adjusting items on income tax expense\nDivestitures and wind-down of operations\n(7)\n–\n–\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n(4)\n(6)\n(5)\nRestructuring charge and severance provisions\n–\n(15)\n–\nImpairment of non-financial assets\n–\n(61)\n–\nTotal impact of adjusting items on income tax expense\n(11)\n(82)\n(5)\nTotal impact of adjusting items on net income\n$\n1,369\n$\n430\n$\n13\nImpact of adjusting items on NCI\n(191)\n–\n–\nTotal impact of adjusting items on net income attributable to equity\nholders\n$\n1,178\n$\n430\n$\n13\nAdjusted Results\nNet interest income\n$\n5,173\n$\n4,923\n$\n4,773\nNon-interest income\n4,199\n3,603\n3,660\nTotal revenue\n9,372\n8,526\n8,433\nProvision for credit losses\n1,162\n1,030\n962\nNon-interest expenses\n5,111\n4,784\n4,721\nIncome before taxes\n3,099\n2,712\n2,750\nIncome tax expense\n737\n593\n538\nNet income\n$\n2,362\n$\n2,119\n$\n2,212\nNet income attributable to NCI\n37\n47\n25\nNet income attributable to equity holders\n2,325\n2,072\n2,187\nNet income attributable to preferred shareholders and other equity\ninstrument holders\n122\n121\n108\nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n$\n2,203\n$\n1,951\n$\n2,079\nDiluted earnings per share(in dollars)\n$\n1.76\n$\n1.57\n$\n1.69\nImpact of adjustments on diluted earnings per share(in dollars)\n$\n1.10\n$\n0.35\n$\n0.01\nWeighted average number of diluted common shares\noutstanding(millions)\n1,250\n1,243\n1,221\nThe Bank's quarterly financial results were adjusted for the following items.

Under the constant dollar basis, prior period amounts are recalculated using current period average foreign currency rates. The following table presents the reconciliation between reported, adjusted and constant dollar results for International Banking for prior periods. The Bank believes that constant dollar is useful for readers to understand business performance without the impact of foreign currency translation and is used by management to assess the performance of the business segment.\nReported Results\nFor the three months ended\n($ millions)\nOctober 31, 2024(1)\nJanuary 31, 2024(1)\nForeign\nConstant\nForeign\nConstant\n(Taxable equivalent basis)\nReported\nexchange\ndollar\nReported\nexchange\ndollar\nNet interest income\n$\n2,147\n$\n(30)\n$\n2,177\n$\n2,240\n$\n55\n$\n2,185\nNon-interest income\n712\n(13)\n725\n834\n18\n816\nTotal revenue\n2,859\n(43)\n2,902\n3,074\n73\n3,001\nProvision for credit losses\n556\n(4)\n560\n574\n16\n558\nNon-interest expenses\n1,491\n(12)\n1,503\n1,582\n46\n1,536\nIncome before taxes\n812\n(27)\n839\n918\n11\n907\nIncome tax expense\n168\n(6)\n174\n183\n3\n180\nNet income\n$\n644\n$\n(21)\n$\n665\n$\n735\n$\n8\n$\n727\nNet income attributable to non-controlling\ninterests in subsidiaries (NCI)\n$\n44\n$\n(2)\n$\n46\n$\n22\n$\n(2)\n$\n24\nNet income attributable to equity holders of the Bank\n$\n600\n$\n(19)\n$\n619\n$\n713\n$\n10\n$\n703\nOther measures\nAverage assets($ billions)\n$\n224\n$\n(3)\n$\n227\n$\n235\n$\n3\n$\n232\nAverage liabilities($ billions)\n$\n171\n$\n(2)\n$\n173\n$\n183\n$\n5\n$\n178\nAdjusted Results\nFor the three months ended\n($ millions)\nOctober 31, 2024(1)\nJanuary 31, 2024(1)\nConstant\nConstant\nForeign\ndollar\nForeign\ndollar\n(Taxable equivalent basis)\nAdjusted\nexchange\nadjusted\nAdjusted\nexchange\nadjusted\nNet interest income\n$\n2,147\n$\n(30)\n$\n2,177\n$\n2,240\n$\n55\n$\n2,185\nNon-interest income\n712\n(13)\n725\n834\n18\n816\nTotal revenue\n2,859\n(43)\n2,902\n3,074\n73\n3,001\nProvision for credit losses\n556\n(4)\n560\n574\n16\n558\nNon-interest expenses\n1,482\n(13)\n1,495\n1,574\n46\n1,528\nIncome before taxes\n821\n(26)\n847\n926\n11\n915\nIncome tax expense\n171\n(5)\n176\n185\n2\n183\nNet income\n$\n650\n$\n(21)\n$\n671\n$\n741\n$\n9\n$\n732\nNet income attributable to non-controlling\ninterests in subsidiaries (NCI)\n$\n44\n$\n(2)\n$\n46\n$\n22\n$\n(2)\n$\n24\nNet income attributable to equity holders of the Bank\n$\n606\n$\n(19)\n$\n625\n$\n719\n$\n11\n$\n708\n(1) Effective Q1 2025, changes were made to the methodology used to allocate certain income, expenses and balance sheet items between business segments.
