There is no impact to the Bank's consolidated financial results.\n\nThese voluntary changes represent an important step in executing the Bank's strategy and reflect an updated approach to business segment presentation to be consistent with management's evaluation of the financial performance of the business segments. The changes support better decision making within the business segments around pricing and capital allocation to help the Bank achieve its financial and strategic medium-term objectives.\nThe updated disclosures primarily relate to the impact of methodology changes in the Bank's funds transfer pricing, which will result in substantially all liquidity costs allocated to the business segments, and reflect the Bank's strategic objective to maintain higher liquidity ratios.\nTo be consistent with the reporting of Scotiabank's recent minority investment in KeyCorp, the Bank has also made changes to the reporting of certain minority investments in International Banking (Bank ofXi'an) and Global Wealth Management (Bank of Beijing Scotia Asset Management), which will now be reported in the Other segment.\nFor better comparability of results across periods, prior period segmented results have been revised, resulting in an increase in the Other segment earnings of$998 millionin 2024 and$774 millionin 2023, with a corresponding decrease in the combined net income of the four business segments.\nThe changes do not impact the Bank's consolidated 2024 and 2023 reported and adjusted financial results. They also do not result in a revision to any of the Bank's or business segments' 2025 financial outlook detailed in the 2024 Annual Report, medium-term financial and strategic objectives, or financial growth objectives presented at the Bank'sDecember 13, 2023Investor Day.\nThe abridged Supplementary Financial Information package reflecting these changes is available atwww.scotiabank.com/ca/en/about/investors-shareholders/financial-result.html.\nScotiabank's first quarter earnings, which will be reported onFebruary 25, 2025, will reflect these changes.\nAbout ScotiabankScotiabank's vision is to be our clients' most trusted financial partner and deliver sustainable, profitable growth.

    "content": "TORONTO,Jan. 6, 2025/CNW/ - Scotiabank announced today it has entered into an agreement with Davivienda to transfer Scotiabank's banking operations inColombia,Costa RicaandPanamato Davivienda. As part of the transaction, Mercantil Colpatria will sell its interest in Scotiabank Colpatria inColombia.\n\nThe transaction supports Scotiabank's operational efficiency efforts in its noncore markets and strengthens Scotiabank's strategic focus on building a connected value proposition focused on client primacy across its growth markets in the North American corridor andLatin America. The transaction also provides Scotiabank with the opportunity to participate in a business with a proven management team that will be well-positioned to become a leading franchise through increased scale, synergies and an expanded client base. Scotiabank and Davivienda intend to enter into a mutual referral agreement that will provide the opportunity for Scotiabank to continue to support Corporate, Wealth and Global Banking and Markets clients with its services across Davivienda's footprint.\n\"With this agreement, we advance our execution plan towards sustainable and higher returns across our International Banking markets,\" saidFrancisco Aristeguieta, Group Head, International Banking, Scotiabank. \"Davivienda is a proven operator which, through the combined entity, will deliver more scale and become an important partner in supporting our Global Wealth Management and Global Banking and Markets businesses inColombiaandCentral America.\"\nDavivienda is a financial institution with over 50 years of experience and is one of the most recognized banks inLatin Americafor its innovation and digital capabilities with operations inColombia,Costa Rica,El Salvador,Honduras,PanamaandMiami, serving more than 24.6 million clients.\nTransaction Highlights:Subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals in the relevant jurisdictions, the completion of the transaction is expected to occur in approximately 12 months from signing.\nScotiabank will receive a combination of newly issued common and preferred shares reflecting an approximate 20% equity ownership stake in the newly combined entity. As part of the agreement, Scotiabank will have the right to designate individual(s) to serve on the Board of Directors of Davivienda's combined operations commensurate with its ownership stake.\nScotiabank's operations that are part of this transaction will now be considered held for sale for accounting purposes, and an after-tax impairment loss of approximatelyCAD$1.4 billionwill be recognized in the first quarter of 2025. This is expected to reduce Scotiabank's Common Equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") ratio by approximately 10-15 basis points. In addition, there may be changes to the loss up to closing from changes in the value of the shares received and carrying value of the assets being sold.\nWe estimate that additional losses of approximatelyCAD$0.3 billionwill be recorded on closing primarily relating to cumulative foreign currency translation losses.\nAt closing, Scotiabank's investment in Davivienda will be recorded as an investment in associate for accounting purposes. The CET1 ratio is expected to benefit an approximate 10-15 basis points, primarily from the reduction in risk-weighted assets.\nAbout ScotiabankScotiabank's vision is to be our clients' most trusted financial partner and deliver sustainable, profitable growth.
