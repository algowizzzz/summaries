    "content": "TORONTO\n,\nApril 30, 2025\n/CNW/ - Despite market volatility fueled by geopolitical tensions, shifting trade policies and political changes both globally and domestically, defined benefit (DB) pension plans managed by RBC Investor Services clients posted a modest gain of 1.1% in the first quarter of 2025. The results are based on a recent analysis encompassing various client plans across private and public sectors.\nCanadian equities returned 1.2% for pension plans, slightly underperforming the TSX Composite Index, which rose 1.5%. The materials sector was the main contributor to positive performance, surging 20.3% on the strength of gold stocks. However, the information technology sector declined 7.5%, reflecting broader challenges within the tech industry.\nForeign equities held by pension plans fell 0.1%, while the MSCI World Index declined 1.7%. Within the benchmark, there was a sharp contrast between the performance of value and growth stocks: the MSCI World Value Index rose 4.9%, while the MSCI World Growth Index fell 7.7%. Meanwhile, U.S. equities, as represented by the S&P 500, declined 4.2%, underperforming the MSCI EAFE Index, which gained 6.9%. The EAFE's outperformance was driven by strong results in European markets, particularly\nGermany\n, which is expected to benefit from fiscal stimulus, and by the euro's appreciation against the Canadian dollar.\nEmerging markets also advanced, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index rising 3.0%.\nIn fixed income markets, pension plans gained 1.8%, compared to a 2.0% increase in the FTSE Canada Universe Bond Index. Mid-term bonds led the way, climbing 2.7%, reflecting investors' preference for safer assets amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding central bank policies and political transitions.\n\"The first quarter reminded us that sector positioning, currency exposure and geopolitical awareness are key to pension performance,\" said\nIsabelle Tremblay\n, Asset Owner Segment Lead at RBC Investor Services. \"The appreciation of the euro versus the Canadian dollar amplified foreign equity gains, while political developments, including leadership changes both domestically and abroad, sparked investor recalibration. Pension plans that remained diversified and nimble were better positioned to navigate these challenges.\"\nAbout RBC\nRoyal Bank of Canada is a global financial institution with a purpose-driven, principles-led approach to delivering leading performance.

    "content": "The latest Ownr survey showed a vast majority of business owners in\nCanada\nleveraging multiple income sources to fund their business and accelerate growth plans\nTORONTO\n,\nMarch 31, 2025\n/CNW/ - Entrepreneurs are demonstrating their resiliency through a rapidly evolving economic climate, finding ways to move their business forward by drawing from diverse income sources and doubling down on investments in marketing and sales to sustain and scale their business.\nA recent survey from\nOwnr\n, an all-in-one management platform for small businesses, revealed that 86 per cent of entrepreneurs surveyed in\nCanada\nfinanced their business using non-revenue related sources such as personal income and savings, funds from another business they run, and loans from financial institutions, the government, and family and friends. In addition, just over half (52 per cent) reported having two or three sources of income, including full-time jobs (20 per cent), part-time jobs (18 per cent) and other personal investments (20 per cent).\n\"It's a precarious time for many small business owners in\nCanada\ngiven the evolving macroeconomic environment. Despite this, they are unwavering in their entrepreneurial pursuits by diversifying funding streams to fuel their business growth,\" said\nJordan Casey\n, CEO,\nOwnr\n. \"In fact, our survey found that nearly three quarters of entrepreneurs would be happy to launch their business all over again if given the chance.\"\nDriving growth: Putting the customer first\nMore than half of surveyed entrepreneurs said additional funding from non-revenue related sources enabled them to move forward with their business growth and expansion plans. To achieve that growth, the survey revealed an increased focus on customer attraction and retention, driven by a need to differentiate among discretionary spenders. Nearly half of respondents were more likely to explore new products, services, and markets (43 per cent) and strengthen existing customer relationships (41 per cent), versus raising prices (35 per cent).\nAmong their investments, 35 per cent stated that marketing and sales services generated the most value for their business in 2024. Looking ahead, they want to increase their investment in marketing & sales (41 per cent), including efforts to upskill (44 per cent) in this area.\nThe solopreneurship struggle\nThe common challenges of entrepreneurship are amplified for those going it alone.\nAlmost half of\nOwnr\n's survey respondents (48 per cent) were solopreneurs and solely responsible for the ownership and operation of their businesses. Given their limited time and resources, solopreneurs felt an outsized gap in their ability to develop a long-term plan and navigate the changing market trends impacting their business as their capacity was focused on day-to-day operations and keeping their business afloat in the short-term.\nThe planning gap:\nMore solopreneurs stated they had never created a formal business plan (38 per cent), compared to 26 per cent of all entrepreneurs surveyed.\nThe knowledge gap:\nOnly 39 per cent of solopreneurs felt confident in their knowledge of the impact of interest rates and macroeconomic trends on their business, compared to 50 per cent of all entrepreneurs surveyed.\n\"Whether you're a solopreneur or work with a team, a business plan can be an effective framework to anticipate risks, create scenario plans and implement financial and operational contingencies. In doing so, owners can feel less reactive as they adapt to uncertain market conditions,\" Casey stated. \"Reinforcing the benefit of a business plan, nearly 70 per cent of all entrepreneurs we surveyed who had a business plan were optimistic about their growth in the current economic climate, compared to 48 per cent without a business plan.\"\nAmong its suite of solutions to support entrepreneurs,\nOwnr\noffers\nBlueprint\n– a comprehensive and step-by-step online business planning tool to simplify the process for time-strapped entrepreneurs who may not know where to start. The tool includes sections around financial planning, which helps small business owners to manage costs, forecast sales, and allocate funding.\n\"From pandemic to inflation and tariffs, entrepreneurs have remained resilient,\" said Casey. \"At\nOwnr\n, we believe that more than ever, it's important to equip the backbone of our economy with critical business advice, resources, and solutions in simple, cost-effective ways. That way, entrepreneurs can spend more time bringing their products and services to market and supporting their customers – in\nCanada\n, and beyond.\"\nAbout the survey\nThe survey, conducted by RBCx and distributed by Cint and\nOwnr\nbetween\nJanuary 22, 2025\n, to\nFebruary 11, 2025\n, captures the responses of 1,004 current or future (within the next year) business owners based in\nCanada\nover the age of 18. No margin of error can be associated with a non-probability survey, but for comparative purposes, a probability sample of this size would have a margin of error of ± 3 per cent with a 95 per cent confidence level.\nAbout RBC\nRoyal Bank of\nCanada\nis a global financial institution with a purpose-driven, principles-led approach to delivering leading performance.

    "content": "Volatile markets causing concerns\nInvestors encouraged to avoid making reactive decisions\nKey advice: Stick to your plan, focus on what matters most\nTORONTO\n,\nMarch 19, 2025\n/CNW/ - Canadians are looking to investments to help them become financially independent, but are worried about the potential impact of ongoing market turbulence on their ability to build enough savings to reach this goal.\nAccording to the annual\nRBC Financial Independence Poll\n, Canadians estimate they will need approximately\n$846,437\nto ensure an independent financial future – notably higher for respondents living in\nAlberta\n($928,179)\n,\nSaskatchewan\n/\nManitoba\n($958,535)\nand\nOntario\n($916,714)\nas well as Gen X\n($1,128,990)\nand Millennials\n($945,748)\nacross the country. To help themselves get there, 49% of all respondents invested during 2024, including 49% of Gen X and 46% of Millennials.\nAt the same time, almost half (48%) of all respondents agreed their key investing concern is market volatility and investment performance – with 54% of Millennials and 46% of Gen X sharing these same worries.\n\"We're having conversations with investors who have a lot of questions amidst all the uncertainty right now. While it can be difficult to provide clear answers, our advisors have experienced decades of supporting clients during market ups and downs and one thing remains constant: the value of having – and sticking to – a good financial plan with a long-term approach, to help get through any periods of turmoil,\" advised\nCraig Bannon\n, Director, Regional Financial Planning Support, RBC.\nThe poll findings also indicated that just over half (51%) of Canadians now have a financial plan (formal or informal). This includes 50% of Millennials and 44% of Gen X, who responded that having this plan made them feel 'confident' (42% and 38% respectively) and 'reassured' (30% and 35%).\n\"It's hard to put a value on the confidence and reassurance that financial plans are bringing to Canadians right now – especially when those plans are supported by the expertise of an advisor,\" noted Bannon. \"A good financial plan maps out an investment strategy for you to follow. An advisor can help you stay true to your strategy, muting market noise and discussing any financial worries you may have, so you can remain focused on what truly matters: the financial goals you ultimately want your investments to achieve.\"\nA conversation with an advisor can also be helpful for anyone who has available funds they have not yet invested – including any cash deposits they made to meet contribution deadlines for RRSP and TFSA accounts.\n\"If you have money that is sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the ideal moment to invest, you could be missing out on opportunities to get the growth you're hoping for,\" added Bannon. \"This is where\ntime in\nthe market, rather than\ntiming\nthe market, is important. The sooner you can invest and the longer you can be invested, the greater the opportunities to benefit from the gradual growth that markets and economies can experience over the long term.\"\nRBC advice and resources:\nAnyone can freely access RBC's comprehensive\nMy Money Matters\nonline advice and resources hub.

Data was collected between\nOctober 4 to 11, 2024\n. Quota sampling and weighting was employed in order to balance demographics and ensure that the sample's composition reflects that of the actual population of Canadians, according to Census data. The precision of online polls is measured using credibility interval. In this case, the results are accurate to within ± 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, of what the results would have been had the entire population of adults in\nCanada\nbeen surveyed. Credibility intervals will be wider for smaller subsets of the population. Where appropriate, attitudes and opinions are tracked back to previous years' polls. Angus Reid Forum. For comparison purposes only, a sample of this size would yield a margin of error of ± 2.5 percentage points at a 95% confidence level.\nAbout RBC and our unique\nMyAdvisor\npersonalized planning support\nMyAdvisor\n– a digital advice platform only available at RBC – has now connected 4.7 million Canadians to their personalized plan and the ability to adjust those plans in real time.
