    "content": "TORONTO\n,\nApril 30, 2025\n/CNW/ - Despite market volatility fueled by geopolitical tensions, shifting trade policies and political changes both globally and domestically, defined benefit (DB) pension plans managed by RBC Investor Services clients posted a modest gain of 1.1% in the first quarter of 2025. The results are based on a recent analysis encompassing various client plans across private and public sectors.\nCanadian equities returned 1.2% for pension plans, slightly underperforming the TSX Composite Index, which rose 1.5%. The materials sector was the main contributor to positive performance, surging 20.3% on the strength of gold stocks. However, the information technology sector declined 7.5%, reflecting broader challenges within the tech industry.\nForeign equities held by pension plans fell 0.1%, while the MSCI World Index declined 1.7%. Within the benchmark, there was a sharp contrast between the performance of value and growth stocks: the MSCI World Value Index rose 4.9%, while the MSCI World Growth Index fell 7.7%. Meanwhile, U.S. equities, as represented by the S&P 500, declined 4.2%, underperforming the MSCI EAFE Index, which gained 6.9%. The EAFE's outperformance was driven by strong results in European markets, particularly\nGermany\n, which is expected to benefit from fiscal stimulus, and by the euro's appreciation against the Canadian dollar.\nEmerging markets also advanced, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index rising 3.0%.\nIn fixed income markets, pension plans gained 1.8%, compared to a 2.0% increase in the FTSE Canada Universe Bond Index. Mid-term bonds led the way, climbing 2.7%, reflecting investors' preference for safer assets amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding central bank policies and political transitions.\n\"The first quarter reminded us that sector positioning, currency exposure and geopolitical awareness are key to pension performance,\" said\nIsabelle Tremblay\n, Asset Owner Segment Lead at RBC Investor Services. \"The appreciation of the euro versus the Canadian dollar amplified foreign equity gains, while political developments, including leadership changes both domestically and abroad, sparked investor recalibration. Pension plans that remained diversified and nimble were better positioned to navigate these challenges.\"\nAbout RBC\nRoyal Bank of Canada is a global financial institution with a purpose-driven, principles-led approach to delivering leading performance.

    "content": "The latest Ownr survey showed a vast majority of business owners in\nCanada\nleveraging multiple income sources to fund their business and accelerate growth plans\nTORONTO\n,\nMarch 31, 2025\n/CNW/ - Entrepreneurs are demonstrating their resiliency through a rapidly evolving economic climate, finding ways to move their business forward by drawing from diverse income sources and doubling down on investments in marketing and sales to sustain and scale their business.\nA recent survey from\nOwnr\n, an all-in-one management platform for small businesses, revealed that 86 per cent of entrepreneurs surveyed in\nCanada\nfinanced their business using non-revenue related sources such as personal income and savings, funds from another business they run, and loans from financial institutions, the government, and family and friends. In addition, just over half (52 per cent) reported having two or three sources of income, including full-time jobs (20 per cent), part-time jobs (18 per cent) and other personal investments (20 per cent).\n\"It's a precarious time for many small business owners in\nCanada\ngiven the evolving macroeconomic environment. Despite this, they are unwavering in their entrepreneurial pursuits by diversifying funding streams to fuel their business growth,\" said\nJordan Casey\n, CEO,\nOwnr\n. \"In fact, our survey found that nearly three quarters of entrepreneurs would be happy to launch their business all over again if given the chance.\"\nDriving growth: Putting the customer first\nMore than half of surveyed entrepreneurs said additional funding from non-revenue related sources enabled them to move forward with their business growth and expansion plans. To achieve that growth, the survey revealed an increased focus on customer attraction and retention, driven by a need to differentiate among discretionary spenders. Nearly half of respondents were more likely to explore new products, services, and markets (43 per cent) and strengthen existing customer relationships (41 per cent), versus raising prices (35 per cent).\nAmong their investments, 35 per cent stated that marketing and sales services generated the most value for their business in 2024. Looking ahead, they want to increase their investment in marketing & sales (41 per cent), including efforts to upskill (44 per cent) in this area.\nThe solopreneurship struggle\nThe common challenges of entrepreneurship are amplified for those going it alone.\nAlmost half of\nOwnr\n's survey respondents (48 per cent) were solopreneurs and solely responsible for the ownership and operation of their businesses. Given their limited time and resources, solopreneurs felt an outsized gap in their ability to develop a long-term plan and navigate the changing market trends impacting their business as their capacity was focused on day-to-day operations and keeping their business afloat in the short-term.\nThe planning gap:\nMore solopreneurs stated they had never created a formal business plan (38 per cent), compared to 26 per cent of all entrepreneurs surveyed.\nThe knowledge gap:\nOnly 39 per cent of solopreneurs felt confident in their knowledge of the impact of interest rates and macroeconomic trends on their business, compared to 50 per cent of all entrepreneurs surveyed.\n\"Whether you're a solopreneur or work with a team, a business plan can be an effective framework to anticipate risks, create scenario plans and implement financial and operational contingencies. In doing so, owners can feel less reactive as they adapt to uncertain market conditions,\" Casey stated. \"Reinforcing the benefit of a business plan, nearly 70 per cent of all entrepreneurs we surveyed who had a business plan were optimistic about their growth in the current economic climate, compared to 48 per cent without a business plan.\"\nAmong its suite of solutions to support entrepreneurs,\nOwnr\noffers\nBlueprint\n– a comprehensive and step-by-step online business planning tool to simplify the process for time-strapped entrepreneurs who may not know where to start. The tool includes sections around financial planning, which helps small business owners to manage costs, forecast sales, and allocate funding.\n\"From pandemic to inflation and tariffs, entrepreneurs have remained resilient,\" said Casey. \"At\nOwnr\n, we believe that more than ever, it's important to equip the backbone of our economy with critical business advice, resources, and solutions in simple, cost-effective ways. That way, entrepreneurs can spend more time bringing their products and services to market and supporting their customers – in\nCanada\n, and beyond.\"\nAbout the survey\nThe survey, conducted by RBCx and distributed by Cint and\nOwnr\nbetween\nJanuary 22, 2025\n, to\nFebruary 11, 2025\n, captures the responses of 1,004 current or future (within the next year) business owners based in\nCanada\nover the age of 18. No margin of error can be associated with a non-probability survey, but for comparative purposes, a probability sample of this size would have a margin of error of ± 3 per cent with a 95 per cent confidence level.\nAbout RBC\nRoyal Bank of\nCanada\nis a global financial institution with a purpose-driven, principles-led approach to delivering leading performance.

    "content": "TORONTO\n,\nMarch 27, 2025\n/CNW/ - Royal Bank of\nCanada\n(TSX: RY) (NYSE: RY) (RBC) and Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited (TSX: CTC) (TSX: CTC.A) (CTC) today announced a long-term strategic loyalty partnership between Avion Rewards and Triangle Rewards. This collaboration will enhance the value of both programs by linking millions of eligible RBC credit and debit cardholders to Triangle Rewards, enabling them to earn more Canadian Tire Money while unlocking exclusive promotions at Canadian Tire, SportChek, Mark's and other CTC retail banners. The partnership expands the reach of Triangle Rewards and further strengthens Avion Rewards' strong network of merchant partners.\n\"We are bringing together two deeply rooted Canadian companies –\nCanada's\nlargest bank and the country's largest general merchandise retailer – to increase the amount of everyday value, rewards and savings that we provide to our shared customers,\" said\nVinita Savani\n, Executive Vice President, Cards & Loyalty, RBC. \"Our combined scale and unparalleled reach will leverage the strength of our businesses and leading loyalty programs to provide additional benefits for millions of Canadians in meaningful new ways.\"\n\"This partnership creates a loyalty powerhouse, combining strong brands and putting additional Canadian Tire Money into the hands of cardholders and members,\" said\nDarryl Jenkins\n, Executive Vice President & Chief Development Officer, Canadian Tire Corporation. \"It means millions of linked members will gain access to unique promotions and new ways to expand the value of their favourite loyalty programs every day.

    "content": "Volatile markets causing concerns\nInvestors encouraged to avoid making reactive decisions\nKey advice: Stick to your plan, focus on what matters most\nTORONTO\n,\nMarch 19, 2025\n/CNW/ - Canadians are looking to investments to help them become financially independent, but are worried about the potential impact of ongoing market turbulence on their ability to build enough savings to reach this goal.\nAccording to the annual\nRBC Financial Independence Poll\n, Canadians estimate they will need approximately\n$846,437\nto ensure an independent financial future – notably higher for respondents living in\nAlberta\n($928,179)\n,\nSaskatchewan\n/\nManitoba\n($958,535)\nand\nOntario\n($916,714)\nas well as Gen X\n($1,128,990)\nand Millennials\n($945,748)\nacross the country. To help themselves get there, 49% of all respondents invested during 2024, including 49% of Gen X and 46% of Millennials.\nAt the same time, almost half (48%) of all respondents agreed their key investing concern is market volatility and investment performance – with 54% of Millennials and 46% of Gen X sharing these same worries.\n\"We're having conversations with investors who have a lot of questions amidst all the uncertainty right now. While it can be difficult to provide clear answers, our advisors have experienced decades of supporting clients during market ups and downs and one thing remains constant: the value of having – and sticking to – a good financial plan with a long-term approach, to help get through any periods of turmoil,\" advised\nCraig Bannon\n, Director, Regional Financial Planning Support, RBC.\nThe poll findings also indicated that just over half (51%) of Canadians now have a financial plan (formal or informal). This includes 50% of Millennials and 44% of Gen X, who responded that having this plan made them feel 'confident' (42% and 38% respectively) and 'reassured' (30% and 35%).\n\"It's hard to put a value on the confidence and reassurance that financial plans are bringing to Canadians right now – especially when those plans are supported by the expertise of an advisor,\" noted Bannon. \"A good financial plan maps out an investment strategy for you to follow. An advisor can help you stay true to your strategy, muting market noise and discussing any financial worries you may have, so you can remain focused on what truly matters: the financial goals you ultimately want your investments to achieve.\"\nA conversation with an advisor can also be helpful for anyone who has available funds they have not yet invested – including any cash deposits they made to meet contribution deadlines for RRSP and TFSA accounts.\n\"If you have money that is sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the ideal moment to invest, you could be missing out on opportunities to get the growth you're hoping for,\" added Bannon. \"This is where\ntime in\nthe market, rather than\ntiming\nthe market, is important. The sooner you can invest and the longer you can be invested, the greater the opportunities to benefit from the gradual growth that markets and economies can experience over the long term.\"\nRBC advice and resources:\nAnyone can freely access RBC's comprehensive\nMy Money Matters\nonline advice and resources hub.

Data was collected between\nOctober 4 to 11, 2024\n. Quota sampling and weighting was employed in order to balance demographics and ensure that the sample's composition reflects that of the actual population of Canadians, according to Census data. The precision of online polls is measured using credibility interval. In this case, the results are accurate to within ± 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, of what the results would have been had the entire population of adults in\nCanada\nbeen surveyed. Credibility intervals will be wider for smaller subsets of the population. Where appropriate, attitudes and opinions are tracked back to previous years' polls. Angus Reid Forum. For comparison purposes only, a sample of this size would yield a margin of error of ± 2.5 percentage points at a 95% confidence level.\nAbout RBC and our unique\nMyAdvisor\npersonalized planning support\nMyAdvisor\n– a digital advice platform only available at RBC – has now connected 4.7 million Canadians to their personalized plan and the ability to adjust those plans in real time.

    "content": "98% of Canadians have seen more targeted and sophisticated scams\nAlmost two-thirds have received personalized\nfraud\nattempts\nOne-third admit to letting their guard down\nTORONTO\n,\nMarch 10, 2025\n/CNW/ - A majority of Canadians are feeling '\nfraud\nfatigue' and increasingly vulnerable as\nfraud\nbecomes more personalized. According to RBC's annual\nFraud\nPrevention Month Poll\n, almost all respondents (98%) have seen more targeted and sophisticated scams, with nearly nine out of 10 (89%) noting a rise in scam attempts more than ever before (up from 77% in 2023).\nIn addition, the majority (86%) of respondents believe it is getting harder to recognize scams and protect themselves; two-thirds (65%) are feeling tired of always having to be on the alert; and one-third (33%) admit to letting their guard down.\n\"With the increase in volume and sophistication of scams, it's understandable that Canadians are finding it challenging to always have their guard up when it comes to\nfraud\n. Criminals are using the latest technology to gather information, build trust, create urgency and prey on people's needs and fears,\" says\nVanja Gorazi\n, Vice President,\nFraud\nManagement, RBC. \"This has led to a wave of investment, romance, senior and other scams. It has never been more important to stay alert.\"\nRising threats\nPoll respondents continue to place both phishing (generic deceptive messages through email or text) and spear phishing (more targeted emails and texts that look legitimate from a seemingly trusted source) at the top of their list of scams (79%). The majority also continue to see a rise in scams targeting seniors (76%) and deepfake scams (65%, up from 56% in 2024) impersonating trusted individuals or organizations.\nThe best defence against scams\nThe vast majority of Canadians (97%) believe it's worth it to take steps to protect themselves against\nfraud\n. With scams, they recognize the need to question what they see and hear, with 91% of respondents believing the best defence against scams is staying aware and vigilant. Moreover, almost three-quarters (71%) feel prevention measures must be extreme to be effective.\nActions respondents are taking:\n93% never share passwords, PINs, or login details with anyone\n92% never respond to unsolicited texts, calls or emails\n91% say \"no\" when pressured to respond to an urgent request or offer\n84% always use more than one way to authenticate themselves where possible\n71% no longer trust any form of communication, even if it seems to come from a trusted source\n\"It's human nature to do the right thing for our families, friends and communities – fraudsters know this and try to capitalize on it. When it comes to scams, sometimes even one slip can lead to significant losses and stress. That's why it is so important to stay vigilant, educated and talk to friends and family about how to stay safe from scams,\" notes Gorazi.\nRBC provides three top tips to help protect yourself from\nfraud\n:\nStop.\nPause and double-check the source of a message before acting. Do you feel fearful or rushed to click on a link? With more advanced technology, criminals can easily impersonate your family, friends and trusted sources and persuade you to share your information. If an unexpected offer sounds too good to be true, it likely is; and if it looks fishy, it's probably phishing!\nSet up protection features.\nUse technology to protect yourself. Enable multi-factor authentication and banking alerts on the RBC Mobile app, and remember to take advantage of biometric features such as face or fingerprint ID.\nStay informed.\nRemember that:\nThe bank will never ask you to provide your login ID, PIN, password or one-time code to anyone through text, email or voicemail.\nRBC will never ask you to destroy your debit or credit card and then give it to the bank or a third-party to secure your accounts.\nThe bank will also never ask you to add RBC as a payee for verification, complete a transaction to \"secure\" your account, share a link from an Interac e-transfer or download a remote-access application.\nIf you're unsure that you're speaking with an RBC representative, hang up the phone and call the number on the back of your debit or credit card.\nTo learn more about how to protect yourself and report\nfraud\n, please visit\nHow RBC Keeps You Safe from\nFraud\n.\nFast Facts:\n2025 RBC\nFraud\nPrevention Month Poll\nSelected Findings – National and Regional\nRESPONSE\nCAN\nBC\nAB\nSK/MB\nON\nQC\nAC\nScams are getting more targeted and\nsophisticated\n98 %\n98 %\n99 %\n99 %\n98 %\n96 %\n98 %\nI have received an offer that seemed\npersonalized to me, but it was a scam\n63 %\n64 %\n66 %\n61 %\n65 %\n59 %\n61 %\nI'm tired of having to be on the lookout\nfor scams\n65 %\n61 %\n70 %\n70 %\n65 %\n64 %\n65 %\nI have seen a rise in scam attempts\nmore than ever before\n89 %\n87 %\n88 %\n92 %\n91 %\n88 %\n88 %\nIt is getting harder to recognize scams\nand protect yourself\n86 %\n87 %\n86 %\n93 %\n87 %\n84 %\n85 %\nI have let my guard down when it\ncomes to preventing fraud\n33 %\n36 %\n30 %\n42 %\n31 %\n30 %\n38 %\nYou have to take extreme steps to\nprotect yourself against fraud\n71 %\n65 %\n69 %\n74 %\n73 %\n70 %\n70 %\nIt's a hassle to take steps to protect\nmyself from fraud\n60 %\n54 %\n59 %\n57 %\n57 %\n73 %\n58 %\nIt is worth it to take steps to protect\nagainst fraud\n97 %\n97 %\n98 %\n94 %\n98 %\n96 %\n99 %\nI am my best defense against scams\nin staying up to date and vigilant\n91 %\n92 %\n97 %\n89 %\n92 %\n87 %\n86 %\nRESPONSE\nCAN\nBC\nAB\nSK/MB\nON\nQC\nAC\n\"Actions respondents are taking\"\nNever share passwords, PINs, or\nlogin details with anyone\n93 %\n93 %\n91 %\n94 %\n93 %\n93 %\n94 %\nNever respond to unsolicited texts,\ncalls or emails\n92 %\n90 %\n91 %\n93 %\n93 %\n90 %\n93 %\nJust say no when pressured to\nrespond to an urgent request or offer\n91 %\n92 %\n95 %\n97 %\n92 %\n87 %\n94 %\nAlways use more than one way to\nauthenticate themselves where\npossible\n84 %\n82 %\n89 %\n83 %\n84 %\n85 %\n82 %\nNo longer trust any form of\ncommunication, even if it seems to\ncome from a trusted source\n71 %\n68 %\n71 %\n80 %\n73 %\n65 %\n70 %\n\"Types of\nfraud\nthat have increased over the last year\"\nPhishing (generic scams through email or text)\n79 %\n73 %\n81 %\n86 %\n79 %\n81 %\n76 %\nSpear phishing (emails and texts that\nlook legitimate from a seemingly\ntrusted source)\n79 %\n76 %\n83 %\n87 %\n78 %\n81 %\n68 %\nSenior targeting scams\n76 %\n74 %\n76 %\n71 %\n74 %\n81 %\n74 %\nDeepfake scams\n65 %\n62 %\n64 %\n64 %\n62 %\n74 %\n57 %\nAbout the\nRBC 2025\nFraud\nPrevention Month Poll\nFrom\nJanuary 17 to January 22, 2025\n, an online survey was commissioned by RBC among a representative sample of 1,500 Canadian adults (aged 18+), balanced and weighted on age, gender, region and education according to the latest census data.

Diluted EPS was $3.54, up 42% over the same period, reflecting growth across each of our business segments. The inclusion of HSBC Bank Canada (HSBC Canada) results\n6\nincreased net income by $214 million. Adjusted net income\n3\nand adjusted diluted EPS\n3\nof $5.3 billion and $3.62 were up 29% and 27%, respectively, from the prior year.\n1\nOur consolidated results reflect an increase in total PCL of $237 million from a year ago, mainly reflecting higher provisions in Commercial Banking, Wealth Management and Personal Banking, partially offset by lower provisions in Capital Markets. The PCL on loans ratio of 42 bps increased 5 bps from the prior year.\nPre-provision, pre-tax earnings\n3\nof $7.5 billion were up $2.3 billion or 45% from last year. The inclusion of HSBC Canada results increased pre-provision, pre-tax earnings\n3\nby $451 million. Excluding HSBC Canada results, pre-provision, pre-tax earnings\n3\nincreased 36% from last year, mainly due to higher fee-based revenue in Wealth Management reflecting market appreciation and net sales, and higher revenue in Capital Markets driven by strength across Corporate & Investment Banking and Global Markets. Both segments also benefitted from the impact of foreign exchange translation. Higher net interest income reflecting strong average volume growth in Personal Banking and Commercial Banking and higher spreads in Personal Banking, also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by higher expenses driven by higher variable compensation on improved results and continued investments in technology and talent across our businesses.\nCompared to last quarter, net income was up 22% reflecting growth across each of our business segments. Adjusted net income\n3\nwas up 18% over the same period. Pre-provision, pre-tax earnings\n3\nwere up 24% as higher revenues more than offset expense growth. The PCL on loans ratio of 42 bps increased 7 bps from the prior quarter, mainly reflecting higher provisions in Wealth Management and Capital Markets. The PCL on impaired loans ratio\n1\nwas 39 bps, up 13 bps from the prior quarter, including one account in the other services sector that migrated from performing to impaired during the quarter. The PCL on performing loans ratio was 3 bps, down 6 bps from the prior quarter.\nOur capital position remains robust, with a CET1 ratio\n2\nof 13.2%, supporting solid volume growth, and $2.4 billion of capital returned to our shareholders through common share dividends and share buybacks.\n“RBC’s first quarter exemplifies our commitment to staying ahead of our clients’ expectations in an increasingly complex world. In Q1, we delivered strong results and client-driven growth across our businesses, while prudently managing risk and making investments in technology and talent to position the bank for the future. At our upcoming Investor Day, we look forward to sharing more about how we plan to capitalize on our financial and strategic strength to elevate the value we create for our clients and shareholders.”\nRead news release",

    "content": "TORONTO\n,\nFeb. 25, 2025\n/CNW/ -\nCanada's\nagricultural sector is poised to lead a new era of trade diversification, but only if it acts decisively. A new RBC Thought Leadership report,\nFood First: How Agriculture Can Lead a New Era for Canadian Exports\n, outlines a plan to expand\nCanada's\nglobal market share by 30% and drive\n$44 billion\nin new agri-food exports by 2035.\n\"This research highlights a critical moment for\nCanada's\nagri-food sector. While\nCanada's\nagricultural exports have quadrupled in value since 2000, its global market share has shrunk by 12% as competitors like\nBrazil\nand\nAustralia\nexpand into high-growth regions. With rising trade uncertainty and escalating tariffs in\nNorth America\n,\nCanada\nmust accelerate efforts to diversify its trading partners, particularly in\nSoutheast Asia\n,\nAfrica\n, and the\nMiddle East\n,\" states\nLisa Ashton\n, Agriculture Policy Lead, RBC Thought Leadership and author of the report.\nTo achieve this, RBC worked with the BCG Centre for\nCanada's\nFuture to build a model projecting export market share potential. The Food First report introduces a national roadmap designed to unlock\nCanada's\nfull potential as an agricultural powerhouse.\n\"\nCanada\nhas long been one of the world's leading food producers,\" said\nJohn Stackhouse\n, Senior Vice President, Office of the CEO, RBC. \"We have an opportunity to turn agriculture into a driving force for trade diversification and if we act now, we can ensure Canadian farmers, processors, and exporters are well-positioned to lead the global food economy rather than losing ground to competitors. This report lays out a clear roadmap to strengthen our trade relationships, scale our agri-food industries, and make\nCanada\na leader in sustainable, high-value food production.\"\nThe release of the Food First report marks a key milestone in RBC's broader efforts to help\nCanada\nbuild a resilient and diversified economy.

    "content": "RBC is providing clients with more choice, convenience, and security in managing their mortgage\nTORONTO\n,\nFeb. 13, 2025\n/CNW/ - RBC has made the mortgage renewal process easier and faster for clients through a new streamlined, self-serve option in the RBC Mobile app\n1\n. Now eligible clients can seamlessly and securely renew their RBC mortgage from wherever is most convenient for them. The news comes as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) estimates the total amount of mortgage loans to be renewed over the course of 2024 and 2025 represents close to 40% of the Canadian economy\n2\n- a significant number of homeowners.\nClients who choose to renew through the RBC Mobile app will be able to secure their best RBC rate, choose among available mortgage terms that suit their situation, and virtually sign documents — all in a matter of minutes. Clients can also pause the process at any time to speak with an RBC Advisor if they require additional information before completing their renewal.\n\"We understand that renewing or applying for a mortgage can feel stressful for clients — which is something we're actively addressing,\" said\nJanet Boyle\n, senior vice president, Home Equity Finance, RBC. \"Today marks the latest stage in our evolution to provide digital and mobile services that enhance security and transparency in the mortgage journey, while offering clients more choice in how they want to manage their mortgage.\"\nIn the past, most renewals were processed by an RBC Advisor. This new option further simplifies the renewal process while still allowing clients to benefit from additional advice and guidance from RBC Advisors when they need it.\nMobile banking has become a daily digital habit for Canadians. On average, RBC's banking clients use the RBC Mobile app which ranked No. 1 in customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power 2024 Canada Banking Mobile App Satisfaction Study on an almost-daily basis. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, RBC has seen active mobile users increase by 69% and mobile sessions increase by 139%\n3\n.\n\"Our clients are increasingly seeking ways to engage with RBC digitally,\" said\nRami Thabet\n, senior vice president, Digital, RBC. \"The rapid increase in adoption and engagement in the RBC Mobile app demonstrates its vital role in providing clients with choice, convenience and secure banking solutions -which is why we're thrilled to simplify mortgage renewals for clients in our mobile app.\"\n__________________________________\n1\nRBC Online Banking is provided by Royal Bank of Canada.

Now an increasing number of RBC mortgage applicants can securely upload the sensitive financial documents required for a mortgage application in one location, track each stage of their application process, and connect with an RBC Mortgage Specialist at the click of a button. This helps reduce the need for lengthy email chains between advisor and client and reduces the risk of personal information from being intercepted by fraudsters if a client is using unsecure email.\nRBC's digital and mobile platforms have been evolving since the introduction of RBC Online Banking\n1\nin 1996.

    "content": "TORONTO\n,\nFeb. 10, 2025\n/CNW/ - Royal Bank of\nCanada\n(RBC) and Carbonhound, an automated greenhouse gas emissions reporting platform, today announced a collaboration to help Canadian businesses measure, verify, and manage their carbon emissions. This collaboration aligns with RBC's strategy to support clients in their transition to a low-carbon economy.\nAs regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations surrounding environmental and social sustainability intensify, Canadian businesses face increased demands to accurately report their carbon emissions and the environmental, social, and governance risks within their value chains. Collecting and analyzing emissions data can also provide organizations with valuable insights to help manage their environmental impact, drive efficiencies, and achieve cost savings. Designed for businesses of all sizes and industries, Carbonhound's platform offers intuitive tools intended to simplify carbon tracking and reporting processes.\nWith this collaboration, RBC's commercial clients can access Carbonhound's platform\n1\nto:\nAutomate data collection:\nThrough Carbonhound, businesses can streamline emissions tracking with automated data imports for Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Leveraging methodology that aligns with global standards like the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO 14064, the platform offers integration with thousands of data sources to help reduce the risk of manual entry errors and save time.\nSimplify emissions reporting:\nBusinesses can generate emissions reports aligned with reporting requirements set by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB), and more. The platform also allows organizations to generate custom reports, benchmark against their competitors, and share their climate impact with existing and potential customers.\nTake climate action:\nCarbonhound provides tools to help set emissions reduction targets, implement reduction strategies, and invest in carbon credit portfolios. The features are intended to support businesses in taking climate action and achieving their environmental sustainability goals.\n\"This collaboration reflects our commitment to supporting clients with their own climate transitions by providing tailored advice and sustainable finance solutions to help facilitate change,\" said\nNiranjan Vivekanandan\n, EVP and chief operating officer, Commercial Banking at RBC. \"We are excited to work with Carbonhound to offer our clients an accessible solution that is designed to manage and report carbon emissions. Together, we aim to enable Canadian businesses to make and measure progress in their transition to a low-carbon economy.\"\nAs outlined in RBC's\nClimate Blueprint\n, one of the four pillars of the bank's climate strategy focuses on supporting its clients to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In 2024, the bank set a goal to triple lending to renewable energy across RBC Capital Markets and Commercial Banking, and to allocate\n$1 billion\nto support the development and scaling of innovative climate solutions by 2030\n2\n. RBC aims to accelerate the deployment of capital to the emissions reduction efforts of clients in high-emitting, hard to-abate sectors that are producing the traditional energy the world still relies on. These important actions will lay the foundation to help our clients make progress on the journey to a net-zero future at an accelerated pace.\n\"Sustainability reporting has become table-stakes for businesses that want to work in global supply chains and attract top-tier talent. We are excited to work with RBC to help enable Canadian businesses to compete more effectively and expand their margins through sustainability data,\" said Sanders Lazier, CEO and co-founder of Carbonhound.\nFor more information about this collaboration and how RBC clients can benefit from Carbonhound's platform, please visit\nCommercial Sustainable Finance - RBC Royal Bank\n.\n__________________________________\n1\nStatements about the performance and the benefits of the Carbonhound platform are made by Carbonhound Inc. Royal Bank of Canada is not responsible for these statements.\n2\nFor purposes of identifying and tracking investment commitments eligible to count towards this goal and disclosing RBC's progress towards this goal, climate solutions are intended to include products and services that help mitigate the impacts of climate change and/or support the transition to net-zero. While RBC's approach may evolve over time, we intend to prioritize allocating capital toward solutions that will lead to GHG emissions reductions in Canada and globally. RBC's investment commitments eligible to count towards this goal may also include support for solutions with outcomes linked to biodiversity, nature and/or adaptation, such as those described in RBC's Sustainable Finance Framework, among others. RBC aspires to achieve this goal by 2030; however, market conditions, among other factors—many of which are beyond RBC's control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict—could impact our ability to invest capital to advance climate solutions over this timeframe. For purposes of tracking progress towards this goal, RBC's eligible investment commitments made from fiscal 2022 onward are included.

This analysis encompasses various RBCIS client plans across private and public sectors.\n\"Powered by healthy returns in the equity market, we are pleased to report our fourth consecutive positive quarter for RBCIS DB client plans for 2024,\" said Isabelle Tremblay, Asset Owner Segment Lead at RBC Investor Services.\nGlobal equities for RBCIS DB pension plans generated gains of 4.1% this quarter, led by U.S. equities whose returns were boosted by a rapid depreciation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Over the quarter, the MSCI World Index returned 6.3%, led by the Consumer Discretionary (15.7%), Communication Services (13.6%) and Information Technology (11.4%) sectors. On a one-year basis, global equities for client plans returned 24.1%, while the MSCI World Index returned 29.4%, where the top performing sectors were Communication Services (46.0%), Information Technology (45.0%) and Financials (38.2%).\nCanadian equities for client plans underperformed their global counterparts, in part due to a smaller exposure to growth style stocks. They closed the quarter at 3.2% and the year at 21.2% aligning closely with the TSX Composite Index's 3.8% and 21.7% respectively. Top performing sectors for the TSX both this quarter and 2024 included Information Technology (22.2% quarterly and 38.0% annual return), Financials (6.6% quarterly and 30.1% annual return) and Energy (6.6% quarterly and 24.0% annual return).\nIn the Canadian fixed income asset class, RBCIS DB pension plans experienced a -0.2% loss for the quarter and 3.6% for the year, aligning with the FTSE Canada Universe Bond Index's -0.04% for Q4 and 4.2% for 2024. Over the year, the FTSE Canada Short Term Bond Index's annual return of 5.7% outperformed the FTSE Canada Long Term Bond Index's return of 1.4% as the market responded to the Bank of\nCanada's\nsubstantial interest rates reductions.\n\"Our analysis shows solid annual returns for RBCIS DB pension plans, but also emphasizes the need for diversification and active risk management, especially as we enter a year of uncertainty,\" added\nIsabelle Tremblay\n. \"Plan managers continue to adapt their strategies for the evolving pension landscape as we prepare for political changes, including possible U.S. government policies and new Canadian Prime Minister.\"\nABOUT RBC\nRoyal Bank of\nCanada\nis a global financial institution with a purpose-driven, principles-led approach to delivering leading performance.

    "content": "RBC Training Ground will deepen its commitment to inclusion in sport through new program updates\nTORONTO\n,\nJan. 29, 2025\n/CNW/ - Today, RBC launched the 10\nth\nseason of\nRBC Training Ground\n, a nationwide Olympic talent search program that has experienced nearly a decade of unparalleled success. In 2025, RBC Training Ground will host 20 free qualifying events across the country, welcome new sport partners, provide more funding support for athletes and implement program updates designed to provide greater access to high-performance sport for athletes from a wide range of backgrounds.\nRBC and the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) also announced today the renewal of their 78-year long partnership – continuing to make it the longest-standing partnership in the COC's history. The eight-year extension is anchored by RBC Training Ground as well as the legacy\nRBC Olympians\nprogram, which has helped hundreds of current and retired Olympians and Para athletes succeed in their athletic careers and in life after sport.\n\"RBC Training Ground has always been committed to breaking down barriers and ensuring young athletes across\nCanada\nhave fairer and more inclusive opportunities to participate in sport,\" said\nShannon Cole\n, chief brand officer, RBC. \"These meaningful new program updates will help make chasing Olympic dreams more accessible for all athletes across\nCanada\n. We look forward to continuing our partnership with the COC and working alongside our sports partners to find and fund the next generation of Team Canada athletes.\"\nSince its inception in 2016, RBC Training Ground has helped 21 program alumni reach the Olympic Games, 12 of whom have brought home medals for Team Canada. Most recently, 16 program alumni were named to Team Canada for the\nParis\n2024 Olympic Games.\n\"Through this partnership, we at the COC have had the pleasure of witnessing the incredible impact RBC Training Ground has had on scouting and supporting future Olympic talent,\" said\nJacqueline Ryan\n, chief brand and commercial officer, Canadian Olympic Committee and chief executive officer, Canadian Olympic Foundation. \"We are thrilled to continue our partnership with RBC, our longest-standing corporate supporter, as we collaborate on vital programs and initiatives, such as RBC Training Ground, to help power the future of Team Canada.\"\nThe following RBC Training Ground program updates will be implemented in 2025 and were informed in part by a research study published earlier this month,\nFair Play: Understanding the Current State of Racial Inclusion in Canadian High Performance Sport\n, conducted by Wasserman and Sport Information Resource Centre, and co-funded by RBC Foundation and the Canadian Olympic Foundation. They will help address key findings of the research study by improving access, removing financial barriers and enhancing representation to better reflect the diversity in\nCanada's\ncommunities – ensuring that all athletes who want to participate in sport have the opportunity to compete.\nRBC Training Ground Athlete Accelerator\n– a new funding and support opportunity for RBC Training Ground participants facing financial barriers to high-performance sport. In addition to funding, recipients will receive educational development, mentorship support and financial literacy resources. All eligible athletes are able to apply following participation at a 2025 qualifying event. Recipients will be selected on an ongoing basis. For more information, visit the RBC Training Ground website.\nRBC Training Ground Women's Hour\n– an optional, scheduled participation timeslot at all RBC Training Ground qualifying events reserved for women. Athletes will be able to select this option during the registration process. This program update provides women with the option to compete in an environment that may feel more comfortable for them.\nRBC Training Ground Inclusion Council\n– a council to help further advance RBC Training Ground's commitment to providing fair and inclusive opportunities for all athletes. Members will include representatives from the Canadian Olympic Committee, RBC, National Sport Organizations (NSO), former athletes and other industry leaders focused on inclusion.\nExpanding program access to more communities\n– program schedule to include new qualifying events (i.e., in\nYellowknife\n, N.W.T and\nWindsor, ON\n) intended to reach talent who have not always had the same access to participate (e.g., Indigenous and racialized communities, geographically isolated groups, among others).\nAt RBC Training Ground's free qualifying events, athletes aged 14-25 compete in speed, strength, power and endurance testing in front of National Sport Organizations partners. This year, the program welcomes two new NSO partners, Biathlon Canada and Field Hockey Canada, as well as returning NSO Ski Jumping Canada back for its second year with the program. RBC Training Ground is proud to have a total of 15 partner sports for the 2025 season. The Top 100 athletes from qualifiers will advance to the National Final and up to 35 RBC Future Olympians will receive funding and resources to further develop in their sport, an increase in total funded athletes from previous years.

Since its inception in 2016, RBC Training Ground has tested over 16,000 athletes across\nCanada\n, with more than 3,000 athletes being identified by NSOs as having Olympic potential – many in a sport they had never considered.\nAbout RBC\nRoyal Bank of\nCanada\nis a global financial institution with a purpose-driven, principles-led approach to delivering leading performance.

    "content": "RBC Climate Action Institute releases annual climate action report\nTORONTO\n,\nJan. 14, 2025\n/CNW/ - Canada can make a significant dent in carbon emissions over the next decade by growing and decarbonizing the country's electricity grids, new research from the RBC Climate Action Institute finds. Decarbonizing\nCanada's\nelectricity grids would reduce emissions, drive economic benefit, and contribute to energy security. Meanwhile, despite a combination of policy, capital and consumer action driving climate progress over the past five years, the pace of change is slowing. As we approach the 10\nth\nanniversary of the 2015 Paris Agreement, different models, and new paradigms for thinking about climate are critical if we are to make real progress.\nThese findings and more can be found in the RBC Climate Action Institute's annual report:\nClimate Action 2025: a year for rewiring\n. The research provides a unique perspective on\nCanada's\nclimate progress, including new survey and interview data that reveal how businesses and consumers are feeling about the state of climate progress in\nCanada\n. Informed by the Institute's team of researchers, Climate Action 2025: a year for rewiring questions whether\nCanada\nis on track to meet its climate commitments, while at the same time, highlighting bright-spots in several sectors.\n\"2025 is shaping up to be a year of climate uncertainty. Political change and economic frustration have challenged how businesses and governments are thinking about climate action, but these same forces also offer opportunities to advance our collective approaches in a new global reality,\"\n–\nJohn Stackhouse\n, SVP, Office of the CEO, RBC.\nSome of the key findings from this second annual assessment of Canadian climate action include:\nClimate action has nearly doubled in the last 5 years.\nAccording to the Institute's Climate Action Barometer, policy, capital and consumers have driven a near doubling of climate action in\nCanada\nover the past five years.\nCanada\nis not on course to meet its climate targets.\nEmissions fell by 0.8% in 2023, led by progress in the electricity sector. However, at this pace, government projections suggest that\nCanada\nwill not meet the targets in its 2030 Emission Reduction Plan until 2035.\nClimate investment is slowing.\nCleantech investments in heavy industry fell dramatically in 2024. Venture capital financing slowed to\n$158 million\nin the year, compared to a combined\n$650 million\non average in the previous two years, partly due to an overall global downturn in investment flows and faltering investor sentiment around cleantech.\nAlberta\nis at the forefront of Canadian climate action.\nAlberta's\nremoval of more than six megatonnes of coal-based emissions drove national electricity emissions lower by about 12%. The province is now coal-free—six years ahead of schedule.\nConcern over climate change is waning among Canadians\n. Approximately 14% of Canadians cited climate change as one of their top 3 concerns—compared to 26% in 2019. What will this mean for where climate will sit on the country's political agenda?\nCanadian businesses see themselves on the frontlines of climate action\n. According to our survey, over half of executives identified government subsidies (55%), internal funding (53%), and C-suite buy-in (50%) as the most significant factors for driving emissions reduction in their organizations.\nThis research by RBC's Climate Action Institute offers a comprehensive view of Canadian climate progress to date. The Institute surveyed 2,000 Canadians and 100 Canadian business leaders for their views on climate action, providing a unique perspective on how attitudes towards climate are evolving. The Institute also developed the Climate Action Barometer – a proprietary tool that combines industry scores for Policy, Capital, Action & Sentiment, Emissions and Technology to track economy-wide climate progress. Tying this in-depth research together, images throughout the report were the result of a\nCanada\n-wide photography program that highlights climate action on-the-ground, across the country.\nClimate Action 2025: a year for rewiring\nalso showcases several companies pursuing solutions for reducing emissions in a series of case studies. From Canada Nickel, a Canadian mining company finding new ways to sequester carbon as it extracts ore, to Semex, a Canadian agriculture company reducing methane emissions in dairy cattle – the report highlights the important, often behind the scenes ways that companies are helping\nCanada\nachieve its climate goals.\nRead the full Climate Action 2025 report.\nAbout the RBC Climate Action Institute (The Institute)\nThe Institute strives to bring together research insights and industry experts to help clients and communities apply climate solutions.
