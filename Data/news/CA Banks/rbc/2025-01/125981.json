  "content": "TORONTO\n,\nFeb. 25, 2025\n/CNW/ -\nCanada's\nagricultural sector is poised to lead a new era of trade diversification, but only if it acts decisively. A new RBC Thought Leadership report,\nFood First: How Agriculture Can Lead a New Era for Canadian Exports\n, outlines a plan to expand\nCanada's\nglobal market share by 30% and drive\n$44 billion\nin new agri-food exports by 2035.\n\"This research highlights a critical moment for\nCanada's\nagri-food sector. While\nCanada's\nagricultural exports have quadrupled in value since 2000, its global market share has shrunk by 12% as competitors like\nBrazil\nand\nAustralia\nexpand into high-growth regions. With rising trade uncertainty and escalating tariffs in\nNorth America\n,\nCanada\nmust accelerate efforts to diversify its trading partners, particularly in\nSoutheast Asia\n,\nAfrica\n, and the\nMiddle East\n,\" states\nLisa Ashton\n, Agriculture Policy Lead, RBC Thought Leadership and author of the report.\nTo achieve this, RBC worked with the BCG Centre for\nCanada's\nFuture to build a model projecting export market share potential. The Food First report introduces a national roadmap designed to unlock\nCanada's\nfull potential as an agricultural powerhouse.\n\"\nCanada\nhas long been one of the world's leading food producers,\" said\nJohn Stackhouse\n, Senior Vice President, Office of the CEO, RBC. \"We have an opportunity to turn agriculture into a driving force for trade diversification and if we act now, we can ensure Canadian farmers, processors, and exporters are well-positioned to lead the global food economy rather than losing ground to competitors. This report lays out a clear roadmap to strengthen our trade relationships, scale our agri-food industries, and make\nCanada\na leader in sustainable, high-value food production.\"\nThe release of the Food First report marks a key milestone in RBC's broader efforts to help\nCanada\nbuild a resilient and diversified economy. The report is part of series of major initiatives tied to the\nRBC Trade Hub\n, a platform designed to provide data-driven insights, strategic recommendations, and actionable solutions for\nCanada's\ntrade future.\nThrough the Trade Hub, RBC will bring together business leaders, policymakers, and industry experts to drive forward a new vision for Canadian trade - one that strengthens\nNorth America\nwhile expanding globally.\nKey Recommendations from the Food First Report\nInnovation:\nAccelerate the adoption of precision farming and food processing technologies to increase productivity and efficiency.\nCapital:\nScale up agri-food processing clusters to add value to raw commodities and expand\nCanada's\nfootprint in global markets.\nDigital access\n: Close the 5G and high-speed internet gap in rural\nCanada\nto unlock the full potential of digital agriculture.\nExport Infrastructure\n: Modernize ports, logistics, and transportation networks to reduce bottlenecks and improve export reliability.\nGlobal marketing:\nStrengthen market development efforts and regulatory alignment in high-growth regions like\nSoutheast Asia\n,\nAfrica\n, and\nLatin America\n.\nAbout RBC Thought Leadership\nRBC Thought Leadership strives to deliver critical insights to help businesses, policymakers, and communities make informed decisions in a changing world.
