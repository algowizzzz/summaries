    "content": "New iCapital fund provides access to a portfolio of direct private infrastructure assets\nTORONTO\n,\nMay 7, 2025\n/CNW/ - TD Asset Management Inc. (\"TDAM\") today announced a new way for investors to access private global infrastructure investments. Eligible Canadian accredited investors will now have access to TDAM's institutionally available infrastructure strategy, the TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund (\nCanada\n) L.P. (the \"Institutional Fund\"), through a collaboration with iCapital Network Canada Ltd. (\"iCapital\nCanada\n\"), a global financial technology platform driving access to alternative investments for the wealth and asset management industries. The\nTD Greystone Infrastructure iCapital Canada Access Fund\n(the \"Access Fund\"), managed by iCapital\nCanada\n, invests substantially all its assets in TDAM's Institutional Fund and is available to eligible Canadian accredited investors.\nPrivate Infrastructure is a growing part of institutional and high-net-worth portfolios that can provide diversification benefits, enhanced returns, lower volatility and inflation protection. TDAM's Institutional Fund has a 10+ year track record and a portfolio of private infrastructure assets with over 500 projects across 7 countries. The Institutional Fund invests in infrastructure that delivers essential services for an economy offering accredited investors potential stability and growth during times of uncertainty and over the long-term.\n\"At a time of global uncertainty, we are excited to work with iCapital to provide access to our institutional portfolio of infrastructure assets to eligible Canadian accredited investors and advisor-led market. We have been managing the Institutional Fund for more than 10 years and have built a high-quality portfolio of private infrastructure that can provide inflation protection, long-term contracted revenues and diversification, benefiting client portfolios. We believe this structure allows retail investors to participate alongside institutions with the same underlying infrastructure portfolio and assets,\" said\nJeffrey Mouland\n, Managing Director, Head of Global Infrastructure Investments, TDAM.\n\"We're thrilled to collaborate with TDAM to provide eligible Canadian accredited investors with easy and transparent access to alternatives,\" said Tom Johnston, Managing Director, Head of Client Solutions Canada at iCapital. \"This collaboration solidifies iCapital's position as a trusted technology partner to deliver a comprehensive digital investing experience for\nCanada's\nleading wealth advisors and asset managers.\"\nTDAM's infrastructure investment team takes a hands-on approach to provide a portfolio of operating infrastructure, with potential for long-term revenues and inflation protection. They have significant experience in private infrastructure and actively manage the portfolio through oversight of development, construction, and procurement activities, board representation, as well as financing. The Access Fund provides access to the Institutional Fund which provides diversification across each of these projects and creates what we believe is an attractive allocation to the infrastructure asset class for investment portfolios.\nThe TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund is comprised of the TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund (Global Master) SCSp, the TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund (\nCanada\n) L.P., the TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund (\nCanada\n) L.P. II, the TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund (Cayman Feeder) L.P. and the TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund (Luxembourg Feeder) SCSp. Each of the Feeder Funds act as a feeder fund in a master-feeder structure and invests all or substantially all of its assets in the TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund (Global Master) SCSp. The Master Fund is priced monthly in USD and includes any working capital within the Master Fund, as well as the current USD value of the most recent valuation of the underlying investments. Valuations of the investments held in the Master Fund are done on a quarterly basis in the local currency of the investment. Interim valuations may be done as the result of specific situations. At each monthly pricing period, the investment valuations are converted to USD at the rate in effect of the pricing date. Effective\nFebruary 1, 2024\n, the Master Fund redomiciled from the\nCayman Islands\nto\nLuxembourg\n. Historical performance prior to that time reflects the performance of the TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund (Global Master) L.P. Thereafter, the performance reflects the TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund (Global Master) SCSp. The Feeder Funds are priced monthly in U.S. dollars and include working capital held within the Feeder Funds as well as the updated monthly value of the units held in the Master Fund. The value of the Feeder Funds investment in the Master Fund is determined based on the updated monthly price of the Master Fund.\n®The TD logo and other TD trademarks are the property of The Toronto-Dominion Bank or its subsidiaries.\nAbout TD Asset Management Inc.\nTD Asset Management Inc.

The Bank's internal threshold may change from time to time. The total amount of catastrophe claims presented reflects the estimated pre-tax cost of these claims net of recoveries from related reinsurance coverage and, when applicable, includes the cost of reinsurance reinstatement premiums. The total amount of catastrophe claims is included in Insurance service expenses and amounts related to reinsurance coverage are included in Other income (loss) on the Bank's Consolidated Statement of Income.\nAdditional information about the Bank's insurance catastrophe claims (including catastrophe claims, net of reinsurance for the comparative quarter) is available on its website here:\nhttps://www.td.com/ca/en/about-td/for-investors/investor-relations/financial-information\nQuarterly Earnings Announcement\nTD will release its second-quarter financial results and host an earnings conference call on\nThursday, May 22, 2025\n.\nCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Information\nFrom time to time, the Bank (as defined in this document) makes written and/or oral forward-looking statements, including in this document, in other filings with Canadian regulators or\nthe United States\n(U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in other communications. In addition, representatives of the Bank may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media, and others. All such statements are made pursuant to the \"safe harbour\" provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation, including the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements made in this document, the Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"2024 MD&A\") in the Bank's 2024 Annual Report under the heading \"Economic Summary and Outlook\", under the headings \"Key Priorities for 2025\" and \"Operating Environment and Outlook\" for the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading \"2024 Accomplishments and Focus for 2025\" for the Corporate segment, and in other statements regarding the Bank's objectives and priorities for 2025 and beyond and strategies to achieve them, the regulatory environment in which the Bank operates, and the Bank's anticipated financial performance.\nForward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as \"will\", \"would\", \"should\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"forecast\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"goal\", \"target\", \"possible\", \"potential\", \"predict\", \"project\", \"may\", and \"could\" and similar expressions or variations thereof, or the negative thereof, but these terms are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. By their very nature, these forward-looking statements require the Bank to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific. Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory environments, such risks and uncertainties – many of which are beyond the Bank's control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements.\nRisk factors that could cause, individually or in the aggregate, such differences include: strategic, credit, market (including equity, commodity, foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit spreads), operational (including technology, cyber security, process, systems, data, third-party,\nfraud\n, infrastructure, insider and conduct), model, insurance, liquidity, capital adequacy, legal and regulatory compliance (including financial crime), reputational, environmental and social, and other risks. Examples of such risk factors include general business and economic conditions in the regions in which the Bank operates (including the economic, financial, and other impacts of pandemics); geopolitical risk (including the potential impact of new or elevated tariffs); inflation, interest rates and recession uncertainty; regulatory oversight and compliance risk; risks associated with the Bank's ability to satisfy the terms of the global resolution of the investigations into the Bank's U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/anti-money laundering (AML) program; the impact of the global resolution of the investigations into the Bank's U.S. BSA/AML program on the Bank's businesses, operations, financial condition, and reputation; the ability of the Bank to execute on long-term strategies, shorter-term key strategic priorities, including the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions and integration of acquisitions, the ability of the Bank to achieve its financial or strategic objectives with respect to its investments, business retention plans, and other strategic plans; technology and cyber security risk (including cyber-attacks, data security breaches or technology failures) on the Bank's technologies, systems and networks, those of the Bank's customers (including their own devices), and third parties providing services to the Bank; data risk; model risk;\nfraud\nactivity; insider risk; conduct risk; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to the Bank or its affiliates, including relating to the care and control of information, and other risks arising from the Bank's use of third-parties; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws, rules and regulations, including without limitation consumer protection laws and regulations, tax laws, capital guidelines and liquidity regulatory guidance; increased competition from incumbents and new entrants (including Fintechs and big technology competitors); shifts in consumer attitudes and disruptive technology; environmental and social risk (including climate-related risk); exposure related to litigation and regulatory matters; ability of the Bank to attract, develop, and retain key talent; changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices; downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of ratings assigned by any rating agency, the value and market price of the Bank's common shares and other securities may be impacted by market conditions and other factors; the interconnectivity of financial institutions including existing and potential international debt crises; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Bank; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events and claims resulting from such events.\nThe Bank cautions that the preceding list is not exhaustive of all possible risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect the Bank's results. For more detailed information, please refer to the \"Risk Factors and Management\" section of the 2024 MD&A, as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders and news releases (as applicable) related to any events or transactions discussed under the headings \"Significant Events\", \"Significant and Subsequent Events\" or \"Update on U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Program Remediation and Enterprise AML Program Improvement Activities\" in the relevant MD&A, which applicable releases may be found on\nwww.td.com\n.\nAll such factors, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements, should be considered carefully when making decisions with respect to the Bank. The Bank cautions readers not to place undue reliance on the Bank's forward-looking statements. Material economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this document are set out in the 2024 MD&A under the headings \"Economic Summary and Outlook\" and \"Significant Events\", under the headings \"Key Priorities for 2025\" and \"Operating Environment and Outlook\" for the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading \"2024 Accomplishments and Focus for 2025\" for the Corporate segment, each as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders and news releases (as applicable).\nAny forward-looking statements contained in this document represent the views of management only as of the date hereof and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank's shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank's financial position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, and may not be appropriate for other purposes.

    "content": "New TD survey reveals nearly a third of Gen Z still unclear on TFSAs, potentially missing out on long-term, tax-free growth\nTORONTO\n,\nApril 23, 2025\n/CNW/ - As tax refunds land in Canadians' bank accounts, a new TD survey reveals that Gen Z is leading the charge when it comes to investing their returns—but many may be leaving money on the table.\nAccording to the survey, three-quarters\n(76 per cent)\nof Gen Z Canadians expecting a tax return this year say they plan to invest it, outpacing both Millennials\n(60 per cent)\nand Gen X (\n48 per cent\n). Yet despite this enthusiasm, only half\n(51 per cent)\nsay they have a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) and among those that don't, nearly one-third\n(30 per cent)\nsay it's because they don't understand how it works – a knowledge gap that could potentially be costing them valuable growth opportunities.\n\"A TFSA isn't just a savings account—it's a gateway to long-term, tax-free growth,\" says\nPat Giles\n, Vice President, Saving & Investing Journey at TD. \"For young Canadians, the earlier you start, the more powerful the impact. Even small, consistent contributions can build serious financial confidence over time, making sure your money is working as hard as you are.\"\nEconomic pressures are pushing Canadians to rethink their financial and investment strategies.\nTD's survey also finds that\n90 per cent\nof Canadians are shifting their financial strategies in response to external pressures—like inflation and rising costs of living. Two-thirds\n(67 per cent)\nsay those pressures are directly impacting how they'll use their tax refund this year.\nAmong Canadians expecting a tax return:\n53 per cent\nplan to invest their refund in their future;\n44 per cent\nwill contribute to a TFSA;\n31 per cent\nwill add to an RRSP.\nBut among those without a TFSA, the barriers are clear:\n51 per cent\nsay they don't have enough money to contribute;\n20 per cent\ncite confusion about how TFSAs work;\n14 per cent\nprefer other savings vehicles.\nGiles emphasizes that a TFSA doesn't require a big upfront investment. \"You don't need thousands of dollars to get started. Even small contributions add up and they grow tax-free. Speaking with a TD Personal Banker can help make it feel manageable and aligned to your financial goals.\"\nTFSAs: More than a piggy bank\nCurrent TFSA holders are using the account in diverse ways:\n29 per cent\nuse it for both short-term savings and long-term investing;\n28 per cent\nfocus on long-term growth (e.g., retirement);\n21 per cent\nprioritize tax-efficient investing;\n18 per cent\nuse it as a short-term savings tool.\nUnderstanding your investing options\nNo matter how Canadians are looking to invest in their future, having the right information is key to making confident financial decisions. TD offers a range of tools and resources to help Canadians learn more about TFSAs and other investment options including:\nBooking an appointment with a\nTD Personal Banker\nfor personalized guidance on saving and investing strategies.\nUsing\nTD Goal Builder\n, where a TD Personal Banker can provide personalized investment advice to help customers work toward their financial goals.\nThe\nTD Ready Advice Hub\nwhich has information and articles available on a variety of financial topics and investing.\nWith tax season in full swing, the message is clear: Gen Z is ready to take control of their financial future—but understanding the tools available is key to making the most of every dollar.\nAbout TD Bank Group\nThe Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group (\"TD\" or the \"Bank\").
