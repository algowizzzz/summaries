The fraudsters also are using AI to forge government or financial documents. <span>An\u00a0</span>FBI <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA241203#fn1\">public service announcement</a> also warns the public about how criminals are using AI to commit fraud and how the technology is being used in relationship investment scams.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFraudsters can use new technologies to mask their identities, not only in still photographs, say, in social media profiles, but also in video chats that alter their facial features and voices to match,\u201d said OCEO Director Melanie Devoe. \u201cIdentifying real from fake can be difficult. The best defense is to never give money to people you only meet online.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The advisory provides specific actions people should take to protect themselves, including strengthening social media account privacy settings and keeping personal or sensitive information private, especially from people they only know online or callers using phone numbers they don\u2019t recognize<span>.\u00a0</span></p><p><strong>About the Office of Customer Education and Outreach</strong></p><p>OCEO is dedicated to helping customers protect themselves from fraud or violations of the Commodity Exchange Act through the research and development of effective financial education materials and initiatives.
