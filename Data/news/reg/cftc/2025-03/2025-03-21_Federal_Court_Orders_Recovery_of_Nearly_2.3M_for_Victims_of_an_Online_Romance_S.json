[See CFTC Press Release No.\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8850-24\"><span style=\"border:1.0pt none windowtext;padding:0in;\">8850-24</span></a><span style=\"border:1.0pt none windowtext;padding:0in;\">.]</span></p><p>The order bans Debiex\u00a0from trading in any CFTC regulated markets or registering with the CFTC. It also requires Debiex to pay a $221,466\u00a0civil monetary penalty and over\u00a0$2.2 million\u00a0in restitution.</p><p><span>As part of the scheme, relief defendant Zh\u0101ng Ch\u00e9ng Y\u00e1ng acted as a money mule when his digital asset wallet was used by Debiex to misappropriate at least one customer\u2019s funds. Zhang is believed to be a Chinese national. By separate order issued on March 12, the court ordered the remaining digital assets in Zhang\u2019s digital asset wallet be returned to the Debiex customer from whom they were fraudulently taken. These digital assets are worth approximately $120,000 before transfer fees.</span></p><p>\u201cThis judgment demonstrates the CFTC\u2019s ongoing commitment to protecting U.S. citizens from online scams,\u201d said Director of Enforcement Brian Young. \u201cI commend Jenny Chapin, Dmitriy Vilenskiy and former Division Deputy Director Joan Manley for their diligent and innovative work on this matter.\u201d</p><p>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.</p><p><strong>Case Background</strong></p><p><span>These orders stem from a complaint filed by the Commission on Jan. 17, 2024, which alleged Debiex\u00a0operated publicly accessible internet domains, which it used to\u00a0target victims with a sophisticated fraudulent scheme involving purported digital asset commodity trading. As detailed in the complaint, the scheme involved the coordinated efforts of three groups: (1)\u00a0\u201cSolicitors,\u201d who contacted customers\u00a0via at least one U.S.-based social media platform and pretended to befriend or romance the customers to solicit them to open and fund trading accounts with Debiex; (2)\u00a0\u201cCustomer Service,\u201d which purported to set up and service Debiex trading accounts on behalf of the customers; and (3) \u201cMoney Mules,\u201d such as, but not limited to, Zhang, whose digital asset wallets were used by Debiex to accept and/or misappropriate customer funds. As further alleged, instead of using the funds to trade on behalf of the customers, as promised, Debiex misappropriated the customers\u2019 digital assets. Unbeknownst to the customers, and as alleged, the Debiex websites merely mimicked the features of a legitimate live trading platform and the \u201ctrading accounts\u201d depicted on the websites were a complete ruse. No actual digital asset trading took place on the customers\u2019 behalf.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p><p>The Division of Enforcement thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the FBI\u2019s Phoenix Office.</p><p>The DOE staff responsible for this case are Jenny Chapin, Dmitriy Vilenskiy, and former CFTC Deputy Director Joan Manley. Additional DOE staff who assisted include Jennifer Diamond, Mary Lutz, and Elizabeth Padgett from the DOE\u2019s International Enforcement Cooperation Unit.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p><span>* * * * * *</span></p><p><strong>CFTC\u2019s Efforts in Fighting Online Scams</strong></p><p>The CFTC has issued several customer protection advisories about <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/romancefrauds\">Romance Frauds | CFTC</a>, which warns users of online dating and social media platforms about an increase in scams that lure victims into sending their money to fraudulent websites that claim to trade foreign currency exchange (forex) contracts, precious metals contracts, and/or digital assets.\u00a0</p><p>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company\u2019s registration with the CFTC at <a href=\"http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet\">NFA BASIC</a> before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity.</p><p>Suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, can be reported to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or<a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm\"> file a tip or complaint online</a> or contact the <a href=\"https://www.whistleblower.gov/\">Whistleblower Office</a>.
