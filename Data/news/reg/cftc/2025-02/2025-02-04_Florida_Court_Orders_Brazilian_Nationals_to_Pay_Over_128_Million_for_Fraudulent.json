Nicholas is required to pay $289,000 in disgorgement and $867,000 in civil monetary penalties. The order also\u00a0</span><span>permanently enjoins the three individual defendants from engaging in conduct that violates the CEA, as charged, and</span><span lang=\"EN\"> permanently\u00a0</span><span>bans them from registering with the CFTC and from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets.</span><span lang=\"EN\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">The order resolves a CFTC complaint filed on June 30, 2022. [See CFTC Press Release No.\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8551-22\"><span lang=\"EN\">8551-22</span></a><span lang=\"EN\">.]\u00a0<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">The court previously ordered commodity pool operator\u00a0<strong>Empires Consulting Corp.</strong> to pay $64 million in monetary sanctions for the fraud scheme. [See CFTC Press Release No.\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8879-24\"><span lang=\"EN\">8879-24</span></a><span lang=\"EN\">.]<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>Case Background<o:p></o:p></strong></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">The order finds that beginning in approximately September 2020, the defendants fraudulently solicited individuals to trade commodity futures and options and other products through commodity interest pools under the name EmpiresX through the EmpiresX website and in online videos posted on social media platforms. During the relevant period, Pires and Goncalves, along with Empires Consulting,\u00a0the Florida corporation that operated the EmpiresX commodity pools, accepted and pooled at least $41.6 million from over 12,500 individuals. The order finds Pires and Goncalves collectively retained over $32 million in ill-gotten gains.\u00a0<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>According to the order, Pires, Goncalves, and Nicholas knowingly made false claims regarding the use of pool participant funds, the size of the pools, and participant returns. The order further finds Nicholas showed pool participants an account page he identified as EmpiresX\u2019s profitable account with a large, well-known electronic trading platform, when in fact EmpiresX had no account with that platform, and defendants created a fake website that mimicked the platform\u2019s website to mislead participants into thinking that EmpiresX was actually trading their funds. By November 2021, the defendants stopped honoring participant withdrawal requests.\u00a0<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>The order finds Pires, Goncalves, and Nicholas acted as associated persons of a commodity pool operator, Empires Consulting Corporation, without registering as required, and committed fraud in connection with EmpiresX. It further finds Pires and Goncalves commingled pool funds in violation of the CEA.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span><strong>Parallel Criminal/Civil Enforcement Actions\u00a0<o:p></o:p></strong></span></p><p><span>On Sept. 8, 2022, the Department of Justice announced Nicholas pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with his role in the EmpiresX scheme.
