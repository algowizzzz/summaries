DMO issued similar letters when the KOSPI 200 became a broad-based security index in 2021 and 2022. [See CFTC Press Release Nos. <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8464-21\">8464-21</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8610-22\">8610-22</a>]<o:p></o:p></p><p>The KOSPI 200 became a narrow-based security index in February 2024. Futures contracts on narrow-based security indexes are subject to joint CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission jurisdiction. Futures contracts on non-narrow-based (also known as broad-based) security indexes are subject to exclusive CFTC jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></p><p>The KOSPI 200 is set to become a broad-based security index on February 6, 2025, and the no-action position in DMO\u2019s letter will be effective on that date.\u00a0<o:p></o:p></p></div>\n<p align=\"center\"><b>-CFTC-</b><p>\n</p></p>",
