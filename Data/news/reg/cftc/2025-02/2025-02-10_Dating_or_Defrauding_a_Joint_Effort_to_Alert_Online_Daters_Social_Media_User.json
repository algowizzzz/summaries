Other red flags include:<o:p></o:p></p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li style=\"line-height:107%;\">A prolonged inability to meet in-person.<span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><o:p></o:p></span></li><li style=\"line-height:107%;\">Moving conversations off social or dating platforms to encrypted messaging apps.<span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><o:p></o:p></span></li><li style=\"line-height:107%;\">Repeated suggestions for investments or requests for money.<span style=\"line-height:107%;\"><o:p></o:p></span></li></ul><p style=\"line-height:107%;\">The joint initiative will provide information about how to recognize relationship investment scams, what to do if you are affected, and why to share the information to warn others.<o:p></o:p></p><p style=\"line-height:107%;\">\u201cToday, criminals are better able to hide their identities, create more fake profiles, phishing emails, and more convincing scam websites than ever before,\u201d said OCEO Director Melanie Devoe. \u201cValentine\u2019s Day and the following weeks provide an excellent opportunity to remind people that criminals are using social media, dating, and messaging apps to scam Americans. We ask you to be alert, and to help stop scams by warning your friends and family.\u201d\u00a0<o:p></o:p></p><p style=\"line-height:107%;\">During the campaign, participating organizations will use the #DatingOrDefrauding hashtag and direct users to helpful resources.

The scammers are known to use fake profiles, images, videos and voices to make themselves appear attractive and professional, and once introduced, they send frequent messages to build relationships. These new online \u201cfriends\u201d claim to have made a lot of money trading cryptocurrency, precious metals, or foreign currency, thanks to special knowledge or insider help. The scammers talk about how easy it is and offer to help victims earn extra money. Victims are then directed to fraudulent trading platforms operated by the same organized criminal gangs.<o:p></o:p></p><p style=\"line-height:107%;\">These scams do not discriminate and have victimized people of all ages.
