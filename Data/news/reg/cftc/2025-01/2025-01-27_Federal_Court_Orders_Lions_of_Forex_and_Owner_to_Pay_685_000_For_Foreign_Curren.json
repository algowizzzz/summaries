The court\u2019s decision also permanently enjoins the defendants from engaging in conduct that violates the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged, and permanently bans them from registering with the CFTC and from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets. The orders resolve the CFTC\u2019s lawsuit against both defendants.<o:p></o:p></p><p><strong>Case Background<o:p></o:p></strong></p><p>The orders filed Nov. 13, 2024, find from approximately January 2019 to March 2021, Pulido, aided by LOF, fraudulently solicited clients to trade leveraged or margined retail off-exchange forex on their behalf. Several clients subscribed to a retail forex signals trading service LOF offered that would send signals to buy or sell retail forex for a monthly fee, and, for a higher monthly fee, offered live one-on-one training with Pulido. LOF offered this signals trading service through its website which touted Pulido as a \u201cseven-figure trader.\u201d Pulido, in various social media platforms claimed significant profits trading retail forex. After prospective clients were identified through LOF\u2019s signals subscriptions, Pulido made various material misrepresentations and omissions to the clients, including falsely representing they would earn guaranteed monthly profits by having Pulido use his discretion to trade retail forex on their behalf, and clients could withdraw their funds at any time. However, Pulido failed to pay the promised monthly returns and when clients requested their funds, he did not return a significant portion of the clients\u2019 funds.<o:p></o:p></p><p>The orders also find LOF aided Pulido\u2019s fraud by, among other things, receiving client funds into its own bank accounts; allowing Pulido to use the accounts in connection with his fraudulent scheme; touting Pulido\u2019s supposed trading expertise on the LOF website; and using the LOF email address to communicate with clients whom Pulido defrauded.<span>\u00a0 \u00a0</span><o:p></o:p></p><p>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Eastern Caribbean Securities Regulatory Commission, and the Financial Services Authority of St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines.<strong><o:p></o:p></strong></p><p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this action include Elizabeth C. Brennan, David MacGregor, Lenel Hickson, Manal S. Sultan and former staff member Steven I. Ringer.<span>\u00a0\u00a0</span>\u00a0<o:p></o:p></p><p><strong>CFTC\u2019s Commodity Fraud Advisory<o:p></o:p></strong></p><p>The CFTC has issued several customer protection\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FraudAwarenessPrevention/CFTCFraudAdvisories/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span>fraud advisories</span></a>\u00a0that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the Foreign Currency (Forex) Trading Fraud Advisory, to help customers identify this sort of scam.<o:p></o:p></p><p>The CFTC strongly urges the public to verify a company\u2019s registration with the Commission at <a href=\"http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet\"><span>NFA BASIC</span></a><span>\u00a0</span>before committing funds.
