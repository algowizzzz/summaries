This position is in response to a request from KalshiEX LLC, a designated contract market, and Kalshi Klear LLC, a derivatives clearing organization, to modify CFTC Letter No. <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/csl/24-15/download\">24-15</a> to remove the condition prohibiting third-party clearing by participants and to cover fully-collateralized variable payout contracts.<span>\u00a0</span><o:p></o:p></p><p>The Divisions will not recommend the Commission initiate an enforcement action against KalshiEX LLC, Kalshi Klear LLC, or their participants for failure to comply with certain swap-related recordkeeping requirements and for failure to report to swap data repositories data associated with binary option transactions and variable payout contract transactions executed on or subject to the rules of KalshiEX LLC and cleared through Kalshi Klear LLC, subject to the terms of the no-action letter. The supplemental letter also removes the condition in CFTC Letter No. <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/csl/24-15/download\">24-15</a> that prohibits Kalshi participants from clearing contracts through a third-party clearing member.<o:p></o:p></p></div>\n<p align=\"center\"><b>-CFTC-</b><p>\n</p></p>",
