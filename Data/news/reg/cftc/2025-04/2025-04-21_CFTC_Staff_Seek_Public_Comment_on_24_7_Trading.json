Pham. \u201cOne evolving trend is the move to 24/7, 24/6, or 24/5 trading hours. I look forward to the public comments on this market innovation.\u201d</p><p><span>This request seeks comment on the implications of extending the trading of CFTC-regulated derivatives markets to an effectively 24/7 basis, including the potential effects on trading, clearing and risk management which differ from trading during current market hours. The request also seeks comment on the risks of 24/7 trading, and the associated clearing systems, including risks related to the areas of market integrity, customer protection, or retail trading.\u00a0</span></p><p><span>Comments will be accepted until May 21. Comments may be submitted electronically through the CFTC Comments\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=7583\">online process</a>.</p></div>\n<p align=\"center\"><b>-CFTC-</b><p>\n</p></p>",
