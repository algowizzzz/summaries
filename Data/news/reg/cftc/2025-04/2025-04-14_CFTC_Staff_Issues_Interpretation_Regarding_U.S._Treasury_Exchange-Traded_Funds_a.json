The regulation, which includes \u201credeemable securities in a pooled investment fund\u201d as eligible IM collateral, aims to identify assets that are liquid and will hold their value in times of financial stress.</p><p>The interpretation clarifies the division\u2019s view that shares of certain U.S. Treasury exchange-traded funds may be considered redeemable securities in a pooled investment fund and may qualify as eligible IM and VM collateral subject to the conditions in CFTC Regulation 23.156. Swap dealers, therefore, may post and collect shares of certain UST ETFs as IM collateral for uncleared swap transactions with any covered counterparty. Swap dealers may also post and collect such UST ETF shares as VM for uncleared swap transactions with financial end users.</p><p style=\"background-color:white;\">The interpretation was issued in response to a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/media/10331/CFTC_GMAC_GM_Structure_Subcommittee_Recommendation-UST_ETF_as_UMR_Collateral/download\">recommendation</a> from the CFTC\u2019s Global Markets Advisory Committee and prepared by its Global Market Structure Subcommittee.</p></div>\n<p align=\"center\"><b>-CFTC-</b><p>\n</p></p>",
