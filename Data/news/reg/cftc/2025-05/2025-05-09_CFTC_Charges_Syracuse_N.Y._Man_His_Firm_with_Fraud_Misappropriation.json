Dellas\u00a0</strong>of Syracuse, New York,<strong>\u00a0</strong>and his investment advisory company, <strong>DSD Capital Management, LLC</strong>,<strong>\u00a0</strong>for fraud and misappropriation.\u00a0</p><p>In its complaint, the CFTC seeks restitution, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.</p><p><strong>Case Background</strong></p><p>The complaint alleges Dellas and DSD Capital acted as commodity trading advisors who, from at least February 2021 through November 2023, committed fraud through material misrepresentations and omissions and misappropriation of more than $690,000 from at least two clients \u2014 a 61-year-old man (Client A) and his 91-year-old mother (Client B) \u2014 who had entrusted the defendants to manage their entire lifesavings.<span>\u00a0</span></p><p>The complaint alleges the defendants, who had complete authority over Client A\u2019s accounts, entered into tens of thousands of futures transactions without warning him of the inherent risks. These trades incurred more than $169,000 in trading losses and commissions. The defendants concealed these losses and commissions from Client A, assuring him his accounts were doing well. Although the defendants agreed and represented they would only charge fees equating to 10% of profits, they took considerably more than they were entitled. Indeed, despite the significant losses Client A had suffered, the defendants misappropriated more than $235,000 from Client A by secretly transferring to themselves large sums of Client A\u2019s money and fraudulently charging excessive, unjustified fees.</p><p>The complaint also alleges after succeeding in defrauding Client A, the defendants expanded their fraud to Client A\u2019s elderly mother, Client B. Without her knowledge, the defendants bought or sold futures contracts through Client B\u2019s account tens of thousands of times, causing her to incur more than $196,000 in trading losses and commissions. The defendants actively concealed these losses from Client B and misappropriated more than $459,000 from her by transferring to themselves large sums of her money and fraudulently charging fees that were excessive and unjustified given the defendants\u2019 promise to only charge fees equating to 10% of profits.</p><p>According to the complaint, to keep their fraud ongoing, the defendants took various steps to conceal and obfuscate their conduct. Among other things, Dellas concealed the substance of documents he directed Clients A and B to sign and impersonated them in dealings with futures commission merchants.<span>\u00a0 \u00a0</span></p><p><strong>Parallel Criminal Action</strong></p><p>On May 6, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of New York unsealed an indictment charging Dean Dellas with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection with the same scheme alleged in the CFTC\u2019s complaint. <em>United States v. Dellas</em>, <span>No. 5:25-cr-184 (N.D.N.Y.)</span>, ECF No. <span>1</span> (indictment).</p><p>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of New York.</p><p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Chrystal Gonnella, Dmitriy Vilenskiy, Derek S. Hammond, Jonah E. McCarthy, A. Daniell Ullman II, and Paul G. Hayeck.</p><p style=\"background-color:white;vertical-align:baseline;\"><span style=\"border:1.0pt none windowtext;color:0in;\"><strong>CFTC Fraud Advisories</strong></span></p><p style=\"background-color:white;vertical-align:baseline;\"><span style=\"border:1.0pt none windowtext;padding:0in;\">The CFTC has issued several customer protection\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm\"><span style=\"border:1.0pt none windowtext;padding:0in;\">Fraud Advisories and Articles\u00a0</span></a><span style=\"border:1.0pt none windowtext;padding:0in;\">about how customers can detect, avoid, and report scams.</span></p><p>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company\u2019s registration with the CFTC at <a href=\"http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet\">NFA BASIC</a> before committing funds.
