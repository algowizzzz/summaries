Instead, the Fund\nmay purchase a subset\nof the securities in the Index in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of securities with generally\nthe same risk and return characteristics of\nthe Index. The quantity of holdings in the\nFund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u0093SSGA\nFM\u0094 or the \u0093Adviser\u0094), the investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may invest the Fund\u0092s\nassets in a subset of securities in the Index\nor\nmay invest the Fund\u0092s assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index\nin approximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. The\nFund is classified as \u0093diversified\u0094 under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may become \u0093non-diversified\u0094\nsolely as a result of tracking the Index\n(e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). When the Fund is non-diversified,\nit may invest a relatively high percentage of\nits assets in a limited number of issuers.\n\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at\nleast 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking\nto track the Index, the Fund may invest in\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments, such as repurchase agreements and\nmoney market funds\n(including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund\u0092s assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to\nthe extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries. Futures contracts (a type\nof derivative instrument) may be used by the\nFund in seeking performance that corresponds\nto the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of\nnon-convertible preferred stock and securities\nthat are functionally equivalent to preferred\nstock, including, but not limited to, senior\nand subordinated debt(collectively, \u0093Preferred\nSecurities\u0094). Preferred Securities generally\npay fixed rate distributions (but may pay\ndistributions based on adjustable rates) and\ntypically have \u0093preference\u0094 over common stock\nin the payment of distributions and the\nliquidation of a\ncompany\u0092s assets \u0097 preference means that a\ncompany must pay distributions on its\nPreferred Securities before paying dividends\non its common stock, and the claims of\nPreferred Securities holders are ahead of\ncommon stockholders\u0092 claims\non assets in a corporate liquidation. The\nIndex includes Preferred Securities that meet\nthe following criteria: (i) are non-\nconvertible; (ii) have a par amount of $25;\n(iii) are primarily listed on\nthe NYSE or NASDAQ exchanges, (iv) have a\nminimum amount outstanding of $250 million;\n(v) are U.S. dollar denominated; (vi) are\nrated investment grade by one of Moody\u0092s\nInvestors Service, Inc. or Standard &\nPoor\u0092s Financial Services, LLC ratings\nservices; (vii) are publicly registered or\nexempt from registration under the Securities\nAct of 1933; (viii) have a fixed or floating\nrate coupon or dividend schedule; (iv) have a\nminimum\naverage monthly trading volume of at least\n250,000 trading units during the preceding six\nmonths; and (x) have at least 18 months to\nfinal maturity at time of issuance and a\nminimum remaining term to final maturity of at\nleast one day. The\nIndex does not include auction rate preferred\nsecurities, convertible preferred shares,\nsecurities with a sinking fund, shares in\nclosed-end funds, purchase units, purchase\ncontracts, corporate pay-in-kind securities\nand derivative instruments.\n\nThe Index is\nmarket capitalization weighted. The aggregate\nweight of securities of an individual issuer\nis limited to 5%, and any weight exceeding\nthis limit will be redistributed on a pro-rata\nbasis to securities of\nissuers that do not exceed the 5% limit. In\nthe event the Index includes securities of\nfewer than 20 issuers, the aggregate weight of\neach issuer\u0092s securities will be equally\nweighted and the issuer\u0092s individual\nsecurities will be weighted\non a pro-rata basis. The Index is rebalanced\non the last calendar day of each month based\non information available up to and including\nthe third business day before the last\nbusiness day of the month. As of\nFebruary 22, 2021, a significant portion of\nthe Index comprised companies in the financial\nand utilities sectors, although this may\nchange from time to time. As of February 22,\n2021, the Index comprised 159 Preferred\nSecurities.\n\nThe Index is sponsored by ICE Data Indices,\nLLC (the \u0093Index Provider\u0094), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the\nIndex.\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE\nREFERENCE\n\n22621SUPP2\n"
