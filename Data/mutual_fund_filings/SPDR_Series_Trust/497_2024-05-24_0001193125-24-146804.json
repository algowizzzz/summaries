  "text": "SPDR SERIES TRUST\n\n(the \u0093Trust\u0094)\n\nSupplement dated May 24, 2024 to the Statement of Additional Information (\u0093SAI\u0094)\n\ndated October 31, 2023, as may be supplemented from time to time\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently adopted rule amendments to shorten the standard\nsettlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions from T+2 (i.e., two business days after the trade date)\nto T+1 (i.e., one business day after the trade date), subject to certain exceptions. Consistent with the\nrule amendments, effective May 28, 2024 (the \u0093Effective Date\u0094), each series of the Trust appearing in this\nSAI will generally issue creation units and deliver redemption proceeds on a T+1 basis. Accordingly, the\nfollowing changes are made to the SAI as of the Effective Date:\n                                                                                                            \n  1)  The following replaces the discussion under the heading entitled \u0093PROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION  \n      UNITS\u0094 within the section entitled \u0093PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS\u0094:                          \n                                                                                                            \nTo be eligible to\nplace orders with the Principal Underwriter, as facilitated via the Transfer Agent, to purchase a Creation\nUnit of a Fund, an entity must be (i) a \u0093Participating Party\u0094, i.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in\nthe clearing\nprocess through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the \u0093Clearing Process\u0094), a clearing agency\nthat is registered with the SEC; or (ii) a DTC Participant (see \u0093Book Entry Only System\u0094), and, with respect\nto the\nFixed Income ETFs, must have the ability to clear through the Federal Reserve System. In addition, each\nParticipating Party or DTC Participant (each, an \u0093Authorized Participant\u0094) must execute a Participant\nAgreement that has been agreed to\nby the Principal Underwriter and the Transfer Agent, and that has been accepted by the Trust, with respect\nto purchases and redemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the\nterms of a Participant Agreement, on\nbehalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that it will\npay to the Trust, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component together with the creation\ntransaction fee (described below) and any\nother applicable fees, taxes and additional variable charge.\n\nAll orders to purchase Shares directly from a Fund, including non-standard orders, must be placed for one or\nmore Creation Units and in the manner and by the time set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or the\napplicable order form. The date on which an order to purchase\nCreation Units (or an order to redeem Creation Units, as set forth below) is received and accepted is\nreferred to as the \u0093Order Placement Date.\u0094\n\nAn Authorized Participant may require an investor to make certain representations or enter into agreements\nwith respect to the order (e.g., to\nprovide for payments of cash, when required). Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not\nhave executed a Participant Agreement and that, therefore, orders to purchase Shares directly from a Fund in\nCreation Units have to be\nplaced by the investor\u0092s broker through an Authorized Participant that has executed a Participant Agreement.\nIn such cases there may be additional charges to such investor. At any given time, there may be only a\nlimited number of broker-dealers\nthat have executed a Participant Agreement and only a small number of such Authorized Participants may have\ninternational capabilities.\n\nOn\ndays when the Exchange or the bond markets close earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to create\nCreation Units to be placed earlier in the day. In addition, if a market or markets on which a Fund\u0092s\ninvestments are primarily traded is\nclosed, the Fund will also generally not accept orders on such day(s). Orders must be transmitted by an\nAuthorized Participant by telephone or other transmission method acceptable to the Distributor pursuant to\nprocedures set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement and in accordance with the applicable order form. Those placing orders through an\nAuthorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order by the\ncut-off time. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other communication failure may\nimpede the ability to reach the Distributor or an Authorized Participant.\n\n1\n\nFund Deposits must be delivered by an Authorized Participant through the Federal Reserve System\n(for cash and U.S. government securities), or through DTC (for corporate securities and municipal\nsecurities), through a subcustody agent (for foreign securities) and/or through such other arrangements\nallowed by the Trust or its agents. With\nrespect to foreign Deposit Securities, the Custodian shall cause the subcustodian of a Fund to maintain an\naccount into which the Authorized Participant shall deliver, on behalf of itself or the party on whose\nbehalf it is acting, such Deposit\nSecurities. Foreign Deposit Securities must be delivered to an account maintained at the applicable local\nsubcustodian. The Fund Deposit transfer must be ordered by the Authorized Participant in a timely fashion so\nas to ensure the delivery of the\nrequisite number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, to the account of a Fund or its\nagents by no later than the Settlement Date. The \u0093Settlement Date\u0094 with respect to a creation order for a\nFund is generally the first\nBusiness Day (\u0093T+1\u0094) after the Order Placement Date. The Settlement Date for the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month\nT-Bill ETF is the same day (\u0093T+0\u0094) as the\nOrder Placement Date for orders placed prior to 12:00 p.m. Eastern time; orders placed after 12:00 p.m.\nEastern time will have a Settlement Date of the first Business Day (\u0093T+1\u0094) following the Order Placement\nDate. All questions as to the\nnumber of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as applicable, and the validity, form and\neligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities or cash, as applicable,\nwill be determined by the Trust, whose\ndetermination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash represented by the Cash Component must be\ntransferred directly to the Custodian through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely\nmanner so as to be received by the\nCustodian no later than the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, are not received in a timely manner by the Settlement Date, the creation order may be\ncancelled. Upon written notice to the\nDistributor, such cancelled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a Fund Deposit as\nnewly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery of Creation Units so created\ngenerally will occur no later than the\nfirst Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor.\nDelivery of Creation Units for the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month\nT-Bill ETF will occur on the same day for orders placed before 12:00 p.m. Eastern time, and the following\nBusiness Day for order placed after 12:00 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe order shall be deemed to be received on the Business Day on which the order is placed provided that the\norder is placed in proper form\nprior to the applicable cut-off time and the federal funds in the appropriate amount are deposited by 2:00\np.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions), with the Custodian on the Settlement\nDate. If the order is not placed in proper form as required, or federal funds in the appropriate amount are\nnot received by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions) on the Settlement Date,\nthen the order may be deemed to be\nrejected and the Authorized Participant shall be liable to the Fund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom.\nA creation request is considered to be in \u0093proper form\u0094 if all procedures set forth in the Participant\nAgreement, order form and\nthis SAI are properly followed.\n\nShortened settlement cycles are expected to be available, through which creation transactions can be\nsettled on the trade date in accordance with instructions provided by the Trust and/or Distributor.\n                                                                                                            \n      The following replaces the discussion under the heading entitled \u0093PROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF         \n  2)  CREATION                                                                                              \n      UNITS\u0094 within the section entitled \u0093PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS\u0094:                          \n                                                                                                            \nAfter the Trust has\ndeemed an order for redemption received, the Trust will initiate procedures to transfer the requisite\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to the Authorized Participant by the Settlement Date.\nThe \u0093Settlement Date\u0094 with\nrespect to a redemption order for a Fund is generally T+1. With respect to in-kind redemptions of a Fund,\nthe calculation of the value of the Redemption Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to be\ndelivered upon redemption will be made by the Custodian according to the procedures set forth under\n\u0093Determination of Net Asset Value\u0094, computed on the Business Day on which a redemption order is deemed\nreceived by the Trust. Therefore, if\na redemption order in proper form is submitted to the Principal Underwriter by a DTC Participant by the\nspecified time on the Order Placement Date, and the requisite number of Shares of a Fund are\n\n2\n\ndelivered to the Custodian prior to 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions) on the\nSettlement Date, then the value of the Redemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to be delivered will be determined by the Custodian on such Order Placement Date. If the requisite\nnumber of Shares of the Fund are not delivered by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, the\nFund will not release the underlying securities for delivery unless collateral is posted in such percentage\namount of missing Shares as set forth in the Participant Agreement (marked to market daily).\n\nWith respect to in-kind redemptions of a Fund, in connection with taking delivery of shares of\nRedemption Securities upon redemption of Creation Units, an Authorized Participant must maintain appropriate\ncustody arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in\nwhich any of the Redemption\nSecurities are customarily traded (or such other arrangements as allowed by the Trust or its agents), to\nwhich account such Redemption Securities will be delivered. Delivery of redemption proceeds is generally\nT+1. The order form specifies the date\nat which the delivery of redemption proceeds for a specific Fund is generally expected to occur.\n\nDue to the schedule of holidays in\ncertain countries, however, the delivery of in-kind redemption proceeds may take longer than one Business\nDay after the day on which the redemption request is received in proper form. If the Authorized\nParticipant has not made appropriate arrangements to take delivery of the Redemption Securities in the\napplicable foreign jurisdiction and it is not possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of the\nRedemption Securities in such jurisdiction, the Trust may, in its discretion, exercise its option to redeem\nsuch Shares in cash, and the Authorized Participant will be required to receive its redemption proceeds in\ncash.\n\nIf it is not possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of the\nRedemption Securities, the Trust\nmay in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash, and the redeeming investor will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In addition, an investor may request a redemption in\ncash that a Fund may, in its sole\ndiscretion, permit. In either case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the NAV of its Shares\nbased on the NAV of Shares of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in\nproper form (minus a redemption\ntransaction fee and additional charge for requested cash redemptions specified above, to offset the Trust\u0092s\nbrokerage and other transaction costs associated with the disposition of Redemption Securities). A Fund may\nalso, in its sole\ndiscretion, upon request of a shareholder, provide such redeemer a portfolio of securities that differs from\nthe exact composition of the Redemption Securities but does not differ in net asset value.\n\nAn Authorized Participant submitting a redemption request is deemed to represent to the Trust that, as of\nthe close of the Business Day on\nwhich the redemption request was submitted, it (or its client) will own (within the meaning of Rule 200 of\nRegulation SHO) or has arranged to borrow for delivery to the Trust on or prior to the Settlement Date of\nthe redemption request, the\nrequisite number of Shares of the relevant Fund to be redeemed as a Creation Unit. In either case, the\nAuthorized Participant is deemed to acknowledge that: (i) it (or its client) has full legal authority and\nlegal right to tender for\nredemption the requisite number of Shares of the applicable Fund and to receive the entire proceeds of the\nredemption; and (ii) if such Shares submitted for redemption have been loaned or pledged to another party or\nare the subject of a\nrepurchase agreement, securities lending agreement or any other arrangement affecting legal or beneficial\nownership of such Shares being tendered, there are no restrictions precluding the tender and delivery of\nsuch Shares (including borrowed\nshares, if any) for redemption, free and clear of liens, on the redemption Settlement Date. The Trust\nreserves the right to verify these representations at its discretion, but will typically require\nverification with respect to a redemption request\nfrom a Fund in connection with higher levels of redemption activity and/or short interest in the Fund. If\nthe Authorized Participant, upon receipt of a verification request, does not provide sufficient verification\nof its representations as\ndetermined by the Trust, the redemption request will not be considered to have been received in proper form\nand may be rejected by the Trust.\n\nRedemptions of Shares for Redemption Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable federal and\nstate securities laws and each Fund\n(whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash\nto the extent that the Trust could not lawfully deliver specific Redemption Securities upon redemptions or\ncould not do so without first\nregistering the Redemption Securities under such laws. An Authorized Participant or an investor for which it\nis acting subject to a legal restriction with respect to a particular security included in the Redemption\nSecurities applicable to the\nredemption of Creation Units may be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The Authorized Participant may\nrequest the redeeming investor of the Shares to complete an order form or to enter into agreements with\nrespect to such matters as compensating\ncash payment. Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a \u0093qualified institutional buyer,\u0094 (\u0093QIB\u0094) as\nsuch term is defined under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, will not be able to receive Redemption\nSecurities that are\nrestricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A. An Authorized Participant may be required by the\nTrust to provide a written confirmation with respect to QIB status in order to receive Redemption\nSecurities.\n\n3\n\nThe right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to a Fund\n(1) for any period during which the Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings);\n(2) for any period during which trading on the Exchange is suspended or restricted; (3) for any period\nduring which an emergency\nexists as a result of which disposal of the Shares of the Fund or determination of the NAV of the Shares is\nnot reasonably practicable; or (4) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\n\nWith respect to the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF and the\nSPDR Bloomberg 3-12 Month T-Bill ETF, the right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment\ndelayed longer than one day (1) for any period during which\nthere is a non-routine closure of the Fedwire or applicable Federal Reserve Banks; (2) for any period during\nwhich the Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (3) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Exchange is suspended or restricted; (4) for any period during which an\nemergency exists as a result of which (a) disposal of securities owned by the Fund is not reasonably\npracticable or (b) it is\nnot reasonably practicable for the Fund to fairly determine the NAV of the Shares of the Fund; (5) for any\nperiod during which the SEC has, by rule or regulation, deemed that (a) trading shall be restricted or (b)\nan emergency exists;\n(6) for any period that the SEC may by order permit for shareholder protection; or (7) for any period during\nwhich the Fund, as part of a necessary liquidation of the Fund, has properly postponed and/or suspended\nredemption of Shares and\npayment in accordance with federal securities laws. Any such suspension or postponement described above will\nbe consistent with the Fund\u0092s obligations under Section 22(e) of the 1940 Act.\n                                                                                                   \n  3)  The following replaces the first paragraph within the section entitled \u0093LOCAL MARKET HOLIDAY  \n      SCHEDULES\u0094:                                                                                   \n                                                                                                   \nThe Trust generally intends to effect deliveries of the Funds\u0092 portfolio securities on T+1.\nThe ability of the Trust to effect in-kind redemptions within one Business Day of receipt of a redemption\nrequest is subject, among other things, to the condition that, within the time period from the date of\nthe request to the date of delivery of the securities, there are no days that are local market holidays on\nthe relevant Business Days. For every occurrence of one or more intervening holidays in the local market\nthat are not holidays observed in the\nUnited States, the redemption settlement cycle may be extended by the number of such intervening local\nholidays. In addition to holidays, other unforeseeable closings in a foreign market due to emergencies may\nalso prevent the Trust from delivering\nsecurities within one Business Day. The securities delivery cycles currently practicable for transferring\nportfolio securities to redeeming investors, coupled with local market holiday schedules, may require a\ndelivery process longer than the\nstandard settlement period. In certain circumstances during the calendar year, the settlement period may be\ngreater than seven calendar days.\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE\n\n052424SUPP2\n\n4\n"
