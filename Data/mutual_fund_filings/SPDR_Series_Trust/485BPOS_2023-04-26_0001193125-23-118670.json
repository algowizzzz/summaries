You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.30%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses1                      0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.30%  \n  expenses1                                   \n                                              \n1 The Fund's \u201c Other expenses \u201d and \u201c Total\nannual Fund operating expenses \u201d have been\nrestated to reflect current fees. Example:\nThis Example is intended to help you compare\nthe cost of investing in the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated, and then sell\nor hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $31        $97    $169     $381  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over \u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal\nyear, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was\n39% of the average value of its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal Investment Strategy In\nseeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg EM Local Currency Government\nDiversified Index (the \u201c Index \u201d ), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that\nthe Fund is not required to purchase all of\nthe securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c\nAdviser \u201d ), the Fund's investment adviser,\neither may invest the Fund's assets in a\nsubset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index and in\nsecurities that the Adviser determines have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents\n\n1\n\nor money market instruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements and money market funds\n(including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to\nthe extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries.\nThe Fund may also enter into forward currency\nexchange contracts for hedging and/or\ninvestment purposes. Swaps and futures\ncontracts may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to its Index and\nin managing cash flows. The Index is designed\nto measure the performance of the fixed-rate\nlocal currency sovereign debt of emerging\nmarket countries. The Index includes\ngovernment bonds issued by investment grade\nand non-investment grade countries outside the\nUnited States, in local currencies, that have\na remaining maturity of one year or more and\nare rated B3/B-/B- or higher using the middle\nrating of Moody's Investors Service, Inc., S&P\nGlobal Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Inc.,\nrespectively. Each of the component securities\nin the Index is a constituent of the Bloomberg\nEM Local Currency Government Index. As of\nFebruary 28, 2023, a significant portion of\nthe Fund comprised companies located in Asia,\nalthough this may change from time to time. As\nof February 28, 2023, there were approximately\n622 securities in the Index. The Index is\ncalculated by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\n(as defined below) using a modified \u201c market\ncapitalization \u201d methodology. This design\nensures that each constituent country within\nthe Index is represented in a proportion\nconsistent with its percentage with respect to\nthe total market capitalization of the Index.\nComponent securities in each constituent\ncountry are represented in a proportion\nconsistent with their percentage relative to\nthe other component securities in the\nconstituent country. The securities in the\nIndex are updated on the last business day of\neach month. The Index is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Index. Principal Risks of\nInvesting in the Fund As with all investments,\nthere are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and\nyou could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\ninflation, changes in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the\nspread of infectious illness or other public\nhealth issues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments, or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets. To the extent that interest rates\nrise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally\nanticipated and the value of those securities\nmay fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels,\nthe Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield (i.e., it may lose money\non an operating basis). To the extent that\ninterest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially\nfaster than originally anticipated. If the\nprincipal on a debt obligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the prepayments of principal\nmay have to be reinvested in obligations\npaying interest at lower rates. During periods\nof falling interest rates, the income received\nby the Fund may decline. Changes in interest\nrates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a\nnon-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial\nreport standards comparable to those in the\nUnited States. Further, such entities and/or\ntheir securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility; differing securities 2\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs;\nand various administrative difficulties, such\nas delays in clearing and settling portfolio\ntransactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges\nthat are closed when the exchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is open, there may be\ndeviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed\nforeign market. These deviations could result\nin the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts\ngreater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on\nforeign markets may be less liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities traded domestically.\nForeign governments may impose restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated in a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks such as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign\nexchange transactions. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets include, among\nothers, greater political and economic\ninstability, greater volatility in currency\nexchange rates, less developed securities\nmarkets, possible trade barriers, currency\ntransfer restrictions, a more limited number\nof potential buyers and issuers, an emerging\nmarket country's dependence on revenue from\nparticular commodities or international aid,\nless governmental supervision and regulation,\nunavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial\nreporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for\nunfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The\nsecurities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections\nmay limit very significantly the liquidity of\nsecurities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of\nall companies in the country or region. The\nFund may be unable to liquidate its positions\nin such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater\nfor investments in frontier market countries,\nwhich typically have smaller economies or less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries. Sovereign Debt\nObligations Risk: Investments in debt\nsecurities issued by governments or by\ngovernment agencies and instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that the governmental\nentities responsible for repayment may be\nunable or unwilling to pay interest and repay\nprincipal when due. Any restructuring of a\nsovereign debt obligation held by the Fund\nwill likely have a significant adverse effect\non the value of the obligation. In the event\nof default of sovereign debt, the Fund may be\nunable to pursue legal action against the\nsovereign issuer or to realize on collateral\nsecuring the debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares\nmay be bought and sold in the secondary market\nat market prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Below\nInvestment-Grade Securities Risk: Lower-\nquality debt securities ( \u201c high yield \u201d or \u201c\njunk \u201d bonds) are considered predominantly\nspeculative, and can involve a substantially\ngreater risk of default than higher quality\ndebt securities. Issuers of lower-quality debt\nsecurities may have substantially greater risk\nof insolvency or bankruptcy than issuers of\nhigher-quality debt securities. They can be\nilliquid, and their values can have\nsignificant volatility and may decline\nsignificantly over short periods of time.\nLower-quality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or\nthe market or economy in general. Currency\nRisk: The value of the Fund's assets may be\naffected favorably or unfavorably by currency\nexchange rates, currency exchange control\nregulations, and delays, restrictions or\nprohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates\nmay have significant volatility, and changes\nin the values of foreign currencies against\nthe U.S. dollar may result in substantial\ndeclines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Forward\nCurrency Contracts Risk: In a forward currency\ncontract, the Fund agrees to buy in the future\nan amount in one currency in return for\nanother currency, at an exchange rate\ndetermined at the time the contract is entered\ninto. If currency exchange rates have moved\nagainst the Fund's position at the time the\ncontract is settled 3 or closed, the Fund will\nlose money on the contract. There is no limit\non the extent to which exchange rates may move\nagainst the Fund's position. The markets for\ncertain currencies may at times become\nilliquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter\ninto new forward contracts or to close out\nexisting contracts. Forward currency contracts\nare entered into in the over-the-counter\nmarket, and the Fund's ability to profit from\na contract will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations under the contract. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a\nstandardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract.\nTransactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much\ngreater loss than the principal amount\ninvested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out the futures contract at a favorable\ntime or price. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract. In\nthe event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions,\nand the Fund will be unable to terminate its\nexposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between\nmovements in the prices of the futures\ncontract and movements in the price of the\nunderlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to\nmake timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its\nobligations. Geographic Focus Risk: The\nperformance of a fund that is less diversified\nacross countries or geographic regions will be\nclosely tied to market, currency, economic,\npolitical, environmental, or regulatory\nconditions and developments in the countries\nor regions in which the fund invests, and may\nbe more volatile than the performance of a\nmore geographically-diversified fund. Asia:\nCertain Asian economies have experienced high\ninflation, high unemployment, currency\ndevaluations and restrictions, and over-\nextension of credit. Many Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid growth and\nindustrialization, and there is no assurance\nthat this growth rate will be maintained.\nEconomic events in any one Asian country may\nhave a significant economic effect on the\nentire Asian region, as well as on major\ntrading partners outside Asia. Any adverse\nevent in the Asian markets may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on some or all of\nthe economies of the countries in which the\nFund invests. Many Asian countries are subject\nto political risk, including corruption and\nregional conflict with neighboring countries.\nIn addition, many Asian countries are subject\nto social and labor risks associated with\ndemands for improved political, economic and\nsocial conditions. These risks, among others,\nmay adversely affect the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. Income Risk: The Fund's income\nmay decline due to falling interest rates or\nother factors. Issuers of securities held by\nthe Fund may call or redeem the securities\nduring periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest\nin securities paying lower interest rates. If\nan obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in\nother obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk:\nThe Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy.\nThe structure and composition of the Index\nwill affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to\ntime and may not be identified and corrected\nby the Index Provider for a period of time or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. To the extent\ncircumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and\nthe Fund may therefore hold for a period of\ntime, securities of companies that do not\nalign with the Index's objective and/or\ncriteria. When there are changes made to the\ncomponent securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its\nportfolio, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes\nwill be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as\na result of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to distribute any such\ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse\nfederal income tax consequences. While the\nAdviser seeks to track the performance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The\nFund incurs a number of operating expenses not\napplicable to the Index, and incurs costs in\nbuying and selling securities. In addition,\nthe Fund may not be fully invested at times,\ngenerally as a result of cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or reserves of cash held by\nthe Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing\nin fewer than all of the securities in the\nIndex, or in some securities not included in\nthe Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that\nof the Index. 4 Liquidity Risk: Lack of a\nready market, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIf the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could\nresult in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on\ninvestments in any illiquid investments and/or\nthe difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its\ndesired level of exposure to a certain market\nor sector. Non-Diversification Risk: As a \u201c\nnon-diversified \u201d fund, the Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively small number of\nissuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may\naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund\nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome diversified for periods of time solely\nas a result of tracking the Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party\ncontract that generally obligates the parties\nto exchange payments based on a specified\nreference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can\ninvolve greater risks than direct investment\nin securities because swaps may be leveraged\nand are subject to counterparty risk (e.g.,\nthe risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and\npricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to\nvalue). It may not be possible for the Fund to\nliquidate a swap position at an advantageous\ntime or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Valuation Risk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of the\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201c fair\nvalued \u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time. Fund Performance The following bar\nchart and table provide an indication of the\nrisks of investing in the Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average\nannual returns for certain time periods\ncompare with the average annual returns of the\nIndex and of a relevant broad-based securities\nindex. The Fund's past performance (before and\nafter taxes) is not necessarily an indication\nof how the Fund will perform in the\nfuture.Updated performance information is\navailable by calling 1-866-787-2257or visiting\nour website at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs .\nAnnual Total Returns (years ended 12/31)\nHighest Quarterly Return: 9.29% ( Q4, 2022)\nLowest Quarterly Return:- 11.12% ( Q1, 2020)\nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/22) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201c Creation\nUnits. \u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), Fund Shares may\ntrade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or\nless than NAV (discount). When buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondary market,\nyou may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing\nto accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201c bid-ask\nspread \u201d ). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and\ndiscounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Some\ndistributions may be treated as a return of\ncapital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such\nas a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto\n\n6\n\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 7\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg International Corporate Bond\nETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate  \n  Bond                                        \n  ETF (the\u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide            \n  investment                                  \n  resultsthat, before fees and expenses,      \n  correspond                                  \n  generally to the price and yield            \n  performance of an                           \n  index thattracks the investment grade       \n  corporate                                   \n  sector of the global bond market outside    \n  of the                                      \n  United States.                              \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund ( \u201c Fund Shares \u201d ). You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.50%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses1                      0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.50%  \n  expenses1                                   \n                                              \n1 The Fund's \u201c Other expenses \u201d and \u201c Total\nannual Fund operating expenses \u201d have been\nrestated to reflect current fees. Example:\nThis Example is intended to help you compare\nthe cost of investing in the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated, and then sell\nor hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $51       $160    $280     $628  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over \u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal\nyear, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was\n14% of the average value of its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal Investment Strategy In\nseeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg Global Aggregate ex-USD \u02c3$1B:\nCorporate Bond Index (the \u201c Index \u201d ), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all\nof the securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c\nAdviser \u201d ), the Fund's investment adviser,\neither may invest the Fund's assets in a\nsubset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index and in\nsecurities that the Adviser determines have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments, such as repurchase agreements and\nmoney market funds (including money market\nfunds advised by SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\n\u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries, but only to the\n\n8\n\nextent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries.\nThe Fund may also enter into forward currency\nexchange contracts for hedging and/or\ninvestment purposes. Swaps and futures\ncontracts may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to its Index and\nin managing cash flows. The Index is designed\nto be a broad based measure of the global\ninvestment grade, fixed rate, fixed income\ncorporate markets outside the United States.\nThe Index is part of the Bloomberg Global\nAggregate ex-USD Bond Index. The securities in\nthe Index must have a $1 billion USD\nequivalent market capitalization outstanding\nand at least 1 year remaining. Securities must\nbe fixed rate, although zero coupon bonds and\nstep-ups are permitted. Additionally,\nsecurities must be rated investment grade\n(Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or better) using the middle\nrating from Moody's Investors Service, Inc.,\nFitch Ratings, Inc., or S&P Global Ratings\nafter dropping the highest and lowest\navailable ratings. If only two agencies rate a\nsecurity, then the more conservative (lower)\nrating will be used. If only one rating agency\nrates a security, then that one rating will be\nused. Excluded from the Index are subordinated\ndebt, convertible securities, floating-rate\nnotes, fixed-rate perpetuals, warrants,\ninflation-linked bonds, and structured notes.\nThe Index is market capitalization weighted\nand the securities in the Index are updated on\nthe last business day of each month. As of\nFebruary 28, 2023, there were approximately\n932 securities in the Index. As of February\n28, 2023, the following countries were\nrepresented in the Index: Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan,\nLuxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway,\nPortugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the\nUnited Kingdom and the United States. As of\nFebruary 28, 2023, a significant portion of\nthe Fund comprised companies located in\nEurope, although this may change from time to\ntime. As of February 28, 2023, a significant\nportion of the Fund comprised companies in the\nfinancial sector, although this may change\nfrom time to time. The Index is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Index. Principal Risks of\nInvesting in the Fund As with all investments,\nthere are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and\nyou could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\ninflation, changes in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the\nspread of infectious illness or other public\nhealth issues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments, or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets. To the extent that interest rates\nrise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally\nanticipated and the value of those securities\nmay fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels,\nthe Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield (i.e., it may lose money\non an operating basis). To the extent that\ninterest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially\nfaster than originally anticipated. If the\nprincipal on a debt obligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the prepayments of principal\nmay have to be reinvested in obligations\npaying interest at lower rates. During periods\nof falling interest rates, the income received\nby the Fund may decline. Changes in interest\nrates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a\nnon-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial\nreport standards comparable to those in the\nUnited States. Further, such entities and/or\ntheir securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility; differing securities market\nstructures; higher transaction costs; and\nvarious administrative difficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and 9 settling portfolio\ntransactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges\nthat are closed when the exchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is open, there may be\ndeviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed\nforeign market. These deviations could result\nin the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts\ngreater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on\nforeign markets may be less liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities traded domestically.\nForeign governments may impose restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated in a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks such as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign\nexchange transactions. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Currency\nRisk: The value of the Fund's assets may be\naffected favorably or unfavorably by currency\nexchange rates, currency exchange control\nregulations, and delays, restrictions or\nprohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates\nmay have significant volatility, and changes\nin the values of foreign currencies against\nthe U.S. dollar may result in substantial\ndeclines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation,\nwhich may limit both the amounts and types of\nloans and other financial commitments they can\nmake, the interest rates and fees they can\ncharge, the scope of their activities, the\nprices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is\nlargely dependent on the availability and cost\nof capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change or\ndue to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally\nmay cause an adverse impact in a broad range\nof markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally,\nthereby affecting a wide range of financial\ninstitutions and markets. Certain events in\nthe financial sector may cause an unusually\nhigh degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause\ncertain financial services companies to incur\nlarge losses. Securities of financial services\ncompanies may experience a dramatic decline in\nvalue when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of\ntheir assets, take action to raise capital\n(such as the issuance of debt or equity\nsecurities), or cease operations. Credit\nlosses resulting from financial difficulties\nof borrowers and financial losses associated\nwith investment activities can negatively\nimpact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse\neconomic, business or political developments\ncould adversely affect financial institutions\nengaged in mortgage finance or other lending\nor investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Forward\nCurrency Contracts Risk: In a forward currency\ncontract, the Fund agrees to buy in the future\nan amount in one currency in return for\nanother currency, at an exchange rate\ndetermined at the time the contract is entered\ninto. If currency exchange rates have moved\nagainst the Fund's position at the time the\ncontract is settled or closed, the Fund will\nlose money on the contract. There is no limit\non the extent to which exchange rates may move\nagainst the Fund's position. The markets for\ncertain currencies may at times become\nilliquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter\ninto new forward contracts or to close out\nexisting contracts. Forward currency contracts\nare entered into in the over-the-counter\nmarket, and the Fund's ability to profit from\na contract will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations under the contract. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a\nstandardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract.\nTransactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much\ngreater loss than the principal amount\ninvested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out the futures contract at a favorable\ntime or price. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract. In\nthe event no such market 10 exists, it might\nnot be possible to effect closing\ntransactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect\ncorrelation between movements in the prices of\nthe futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be\nunable or unwilling to make timely settlement\npayments, return the Fund's margin, or\notherwise honor its obligations. Geographic\nFocus Risk: The performance of a fund that is\nless diversified across countries or\ngeographic regions will be closely tied to\nmarket, currency, economic, political,\nenvironmental, or regulatory conditions and\ndevelopments in the countries or regions in\nwhich the fund invests, and may be more\nvolatile than the performance of a more\ngeographically-diversified fund. Europe:\nDeveloped and emerging market countries in\nEurope will be significantly affected by the\nfiscal and monetary controls of the Economic\nand Monetary Union of the European Union ( \u201c\nEU \u201d ). Changes in regulations on trade,\ndecreasing imports or exports, changes in the\nexchange rate of the euro and recessions among\nEuropean countries may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other\nEuropean countries. In addition, one or more\ncountries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw\nfrom the EU. For example, on January 31, 2020,\nthe United Kingdom formally withdrew from the\nEU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and,\nafter a transition period, left the EU single\nmarket and customs union under the terms of a\nnew trade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to\ntrading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain unresolved\nand subject to further negotiation and\nagreement. The full scope and nature of the\nconsequences of the exit are not at this time\nknown and are unlikely to be known for a\nsignificant period of time. It is also unknown\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Any exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist\nattacks and additional attacks may occur in\nthe future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty\nin financial markets and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. Income Risk: The Fund's\nincome may decline due to falling interest\nrates or other factors. Issuers of securities\nheld by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest\nrates, and the Fund would likely be required\nto reinvest in securities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest\nthe prepayment in other obligations paying\nincome at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy.\nThe structure and composition of the Index\nwill affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to\ntime and may not be identified and corrected\nby the Index Provider for a period of time or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. To the extent\ncircumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and\nthe Fund may therefore hold for a period of\ntime, securities of companies that do not\nalign with the Index's objective and/or\ncriteria. When there are changes made to the\ncomponent securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its\nportfolio, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes\nwill be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as\na result of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to distribute any such\ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse\nfederal income tax consequences. While the\nAdviser seeks to track the performance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The\nFund incurs a number of operating expenses not\napplicable to the Index, and incurs costs in\nbuying and selling securities. In addition,\nthe Fund may not be fully invested at times,\ngenerally as a result of cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or reserves of cash held by\nthe Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing\nin fewer than all of the securities in the\nIndex, or in some securities not included in\nthe Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that\nof the Index. 11 Liquidity Risk: Lack of a\nready market, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIf the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could\nresult in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on\ninvestments in any illiquid investments and/or\nthe difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its\ndesired level of exposure to a certain market\nor sector. Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party\ncontract that generally obligates the parties\nto exchange payments based on a specified\nreference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can\ninvolve greater risks than direct investment\nin securities because swaps may be leveraged\nand are subject to counterparty risk (e.g.,\nthe risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and\npricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to\nvalue). It may not be possible for the Fund to\nliquidate a swap position at an advantageous\ntime or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets\nwithin one or more economic sectors or\nindustries, which may change from time to\ntime. Greater investment focus on one or more\nsectors or industries increases the potential\nfor volatility and the risk that events\nnegatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially\ncausing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio holdings, potentially a\nlarge portion of the Fund's investment\nportfolio, may be valued on the basis of\nfactors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or\nreduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding\nwhen market quotations are not readily\navailable. The value established for any\nportfolio holding at a point in time might\ndiffer from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced\nusing market quotations. Portfolio holdings\nthat are valued using techniques other than\nmarket quotations, including \u201c fair valued \u201d\nsecurities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time. Fund Performance The following bar\nchart and table provide an indication of the\nrisks of investing in the Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average\nannual returns for certain time periods\ncompare with the average annual returns of the\nIndex and of a relevant broad-based securities\nindex.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Richard Darby-\nDowman, Paul Brown and Peter Spano, who are\npart of State Street Global Advisors Limited (\n\u201c SSGA LTD \u201d ), an affiliate of the Adviser,\nand provide portfolio management services\nthrough a personnel-sharing arrangement\nbetween the Adviser and SSGA LTD. Richard\nDarby-Dowman is a Vice President and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Team at SSGA LTD. He joined SSGA LTD\nin 2006. Paul Brown is a Vice President and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income\nBeta Solutions Team at SSGA LTD. He joined\nSSGA LTD in 2013. Peter Spano, CFA, is a\nManaging Director and the EMEA Head of the\nFixed Income Beta Solutions Team at SSGA LTD.\nHe joined SSGA LTD in 2007. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201c Creation Units. \u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), Fund Shares may\ntrade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or\nless than NAV (discount). When buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondary market,\nyou may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing\nto accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201c bid-ask\nspread \u201d ). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and\ndiscounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Some\ndistributions may be treated as a return of\ncapital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such\nas a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses1                      0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses1                                   \n                                              \n1 The Fund's \u201c Other expenses \u201d and \u201c Total\nannual Fund operating expenses \u201d have been\nrestated to reflect current fees. Example:\nThis Example is intended to help you compare\nthe cost of investing in the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated, and then sell\nor hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over \u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal\nyear, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was\n14% of the average value of its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal Investment Strategy In\nseeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg Global Treasury ex-US Capped Index\n(the \u201c Index \u201d ), the Fund employs a sampling\nstrategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund\nmay purchase a subset of the securities in the\nIndex in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based\non a number of factors, including asset size\nof the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA\nFM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ), the investment\nadviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined\nby the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund generally\ninvests substantially all, but at least 80%,\nof its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that\nthe Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially\nidentical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt securities that are\nnot included in the Index, cash and cash\nequivalents\n\n14\n\nor money market instruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements and money market funds\n(including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser). The Fund may also enter into forward\ncurrency exchange contracts for hedging and/or\ninvestment purposes. Futures contracts may be\nused by the Fund in seeking performance that\ncorresponds to its Index and in managing cash\nflows. The Index is designed to track the\nfixed-rate local currency sovereign debt of\ninvestment grade countries outside the United\nStates. The Index includes government bonds\nissued by investment grade countries outside\nthe United States, in local currencies, that\nhave a remaining maturity of one year or more\nand are rated investment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB-\nor higher using the middle rating of Moody's\nInvestors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings\nand Fitch Ratings, Inc., respectively).\nSecurities included in the Index may include\nsecurities that are subject to restrictions on\nresale under the U.S. federal securities laws\n( \u201c restricted securities \u201d ). Each of the\ncomponent securities in the Index is a\nconstituent of the Bloomberg Global Treasury\nex-US Index. In addition, the securities in\nthe Index must be fixed-rate and have certain\nminimum amounts outstanding, depending upon\nthe currency in which the bonds are\ndenominated. The Index is calculated by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited using a\nmodified \u201c market capitalization \u201d\nmethodology. This design ensures that each\nconstituent country within the Index is\nrepresented in a proportion consistent with\nits percentage with respect to the total\nmarket capitalization of the Index. Component\nsecurities in each constituent country are\nrepresented in a proportion consistent with\ntheir percentage relative to the other\ncomponent securities in the constituent\ncountry. The securities in the Index are\nupdated on the last business day of each\nmonth. As of February 28, 2023, a significant\nportion of the Fund comprised companies\nlocated in Europe and Japan, although this may\nchange from time to time. As of February 28,\n2023, there were approximately 1,524\nsecurities in the Index. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\n(the \u201c Index Provider \u201d ), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the\nFund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund\nShares will change in value, and you could\nlose money by investing in the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\ninflation, changes in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the\nspread of infectious illness or other public\nhealth issues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments, or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets. To the extent that interest rates\nrise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally\nanticipated and the value of those securities\nmay fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels,\nthe Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield (i.e., it may lose money\non an operating basis). To the extent that\ninterest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially\nfaster than originally anticipated. If the\nprincipal on a debt obligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the prepayments of principal\nmay have to be reinvested in obligations\npaying interest at lower rates. During periods\nof falling interest rates, the income received\nby the Fund may decline. Changes in interest\nrates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a\nnon-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial\nreport standards comparable to those in the\nUnited States. Further, such entities and/or\ntheir securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility; differing securities market\nstructures; higher transaction costs; and\nvarious administrative difficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and settling portfolio\ntransactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities\nheld by the 15 Fund trade on foreign exchanges\nthat are closed when the exchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is open, there may be\ndeviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed\nforeign market. These deviations could result\nin the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts\ngreater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on\nforeign markets may be less liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities traded domestically.\nForeign governments may impose restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated in a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks such as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign\nexchange transactions. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Sovereign Debt Obligations Risk:\nInvestments in debt securities issued by\ngovernments or by government agencies and\ninstrumentalities involve the risk that the\ngovernmental entities responsible for\nrepayment may be unable or unwilling to pay\ninterest and repay principal when due. Any\nrestructuring of a sovereign debt obligation\nheld by the Fund will likely have a\nsignificant adverse effect on the value of the\nobligation. In the event of default of\nsovereign debt, the Fund may be unable to\npursue legal action against the sovereign\nissuer or to realize on collateral securing\nthe debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Currency\nRisk: The value of the Fund's assets may be\naffected favorably or unfavorably by currency\nexchange rates, currency exchange control\nregulations, and delays, restrictions or\nprohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates\nmay have significant volatility, and changes\nin the values of foreign currencies against\nthe U.S. dollar may result in substantial\ndeclines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of investing in emerging\nmarkets include, among others, greater\npolitical and economic instability, greater\nvolatility in currency exchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities markets, possible trade\nbarriers, currency transfer restrictions, a\nmore limited number of potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging market country's\ndependence on revenue from particular\ncommodities or international aid, less\ngovernmental supervision and regulation,\nunavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial\nreporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for\nunfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The\nsecurities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections\nmay limit very significantly the liquidity of\nsecurities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of\nall companies in the country or region. The\nFund may be unable to liquidate its positions\nin such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater\nfor investments in frontier market countries,\nwhich typically have smaller economies or less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries. Forward Currency\nContracts Risk: In a forward currency\ncontract, the Fund agrees to buy in the future\nan amount in one currency in return for\nanother currency, at an exchange rate\ndetermined at the time the contract is entered\ninto. If currency exchange rates have moved\nagainst the Fund's position at the time the\ncontract is settled or closed, the Fund will\nlose money on the contract. There is no limit\non the extent to which exchange rates may move\nagainst the Fund's position. The markets for\ncertain currencies may at times become\nilliquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter\ninto new forward contracts or to close out\nexisting contracts. Forward currency contracts\nare entered into in the over-the-counter\nmarket, and the Fund's ability to profit from\na contract will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations under the contract. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a\nstandardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract.\nTransactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible 16 that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much\ngreater loss than the principal amount\ninvested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out the futures contract at a favorable\ntime or price. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract. In\nthe event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions,\nand the Fund will be unable to terminate its\nexposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between\nmovements in the prices of the futures\ncontract and movements in the price of the\nunderlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to\nmake timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its\nobligations. Geographic Focus Risk: The\nperformance of a fund that is less diversified\nacross countries or geographic regions will be\nclosely tied to market, currency, economic,\npolitical, environmental, or regulatory\nconditions and developments in the countries\nor regions in which the fund invests, and may\nbe more volatile than the performance of a\nmore geographically-diversified fund. Europe:\nDeveloped and emerging market countries in\nEurope will be significantly affected by the\nfiscal and monetary controls of the Economic\nand Monetary Union of the European Union ( \u201c\nEU \u201d ). Changes in regulations on trade,\ndecreasing imports or exports, changes in the\nexchange rate of the euro and recessions among\nEuropean countries may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other\nEuropean countries. In addition, one or more\ncountries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw\nfrom the EU. For example, on January 31, 2020,\nthe United Kingdom formally withdrew from the\nEU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and,\nafter a transition period, left the EU single\nmarket and customs union under the terms of a\nnew trade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to\ntrading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain unresolved\nand subject to further negotiation and\nagreement. The full scope and nature of the\nconsequences of the exit are not at this time\nknown and are unlikely to be known for a\nsignificant period of time. It is also unknown\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Any exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist\nattacks and additional attacks may occur in\nthe future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty\nin financial markets and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. Japan: The growth of\nJapan's economy has historically lagged that\nof its Asian neighbors and other major\ndeveloped economies. The Japanese economy is\nheavily dependent on international trade and\nhas been adversely affected by trade tariffs,\nother protectionist measures, competition from\nemerging economies and the economic conditions\nof its trading partners. China has become an\nimportant trading partner with Japan, yet the\ncountries' political relationship has become\nstrained. Should political tension increase,\nit could adversely affect the economy,\nespecially the export sector, and destabilize\nthe region as a whole. Japan also remains\nheavily dependent on oil imports, and higher\ncommodity prices could therefore have a\nnegative impact on the economy. The Japanese\nyen has fluctuated widely at times and any\nincrease in its value may cause a decline in\nexports that could weaken the Japanese\neconomy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in\nthe currency markets to attempt to maintain or\nreduce the value of the yen. Japanese\nintervention in the currency markets could\ncause the value of the yen to fluctuate\nsharply and unpredictably and could cause\nlosses to investors. Japan has an aging\nworkforce and has experienced a significant\npopulation decline in recent years. Japan's\nlabor market appears to be undergoing\nfundamental structural changes, as a labor\nmarket traditionally accustomed to lifetime\nemployment adjusts to meet the need for\nincreased labor mobility, which may adversely\naffect Japan's economic competitiveness.\nNatural disasters, such as earthquakes,\nvolcanoes, typhoons or tsunamis, could occur\nin Japan or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Japanese economy and, in\nturn, the Fund. Income Risk: The Fund's income\nmay decline due to falling interest rates or\nother factors. Issuers of securities held by\nthe Fund may call or redeem the securities\nduring periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest\nin securities paying lower interest rates. If\nan obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in\nother obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk:\nThe Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy.\nThe structure and composition of the Index\nwill 17 affect the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to\ntime and may not be identified and corrected\nby the Index Provider for a period of time or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. To the extent\ncircumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and\nthe Fund may therefore hold for a period of\ntime, securities of companies that do not\nalign with the Index's objective and/or\ncriteria. When there are changes made to the\ncomponent securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its\nportfolio, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes\nwill be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as\na result of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to distribute any such\ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse\nfederal income tax consequences. While the\nAdviser seeks to track the performance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The\nFund incurs a number of operating expenses not\napplicable to the Index, and incurs costs in\nbuying and selling securities. In addition,\nthe Fund may not be fully invested at times,\ngenerally as a result of cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or reserves of cash held by\nthe Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing\nin fewer than all of the securities in the\nIndex, or in some securities not included in\nthe Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that\nof the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIf the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could\nresult in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on\ninvestments in any illiquid investments and/or\nthe difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its\ndesired level of exposure to a certain market\nor sector. Non-Diversification Risk: As a \u201c\nnon-diversified \u201d fund, the Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively small number of\nissuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may\naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund\nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome diversified for periods of time solely\nas a result of tracking the Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Restricted Securities Risk: The\nFund may hold securities that have not been\nregistered for sale to the public under the\nU.S. federal securities laws. There can be no\nassurance that a trading market will exist at\nany time for any particular restricted\nsecurity. Limitations on the resale of these\nsecurities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from\ndisposing of them promptly at reasonable\nprices. The Fund may have to bear the expense\nof registering the securities for resale and\nthe risk of substantial delays in effecting\nthe registration. Also, restricted securities\nmay be difficult to value because market\nquotations may not be readily available, and\nthe securities may have significant\nvolatility. Valuation Risk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of the\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201c fair\nvalued \u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time. 18\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing changes in\nthe Fund's performance from year to year and\nby showing how the Fund's average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with\nthe average annual returns of the Index and of\na relevant broad-based securities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are James Kramer,\nJoanna Madden and Cynthia Moy. James Kramer is\na Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1996. Joanna Madden is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed\nIncome Beta Solutions Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2003. Cynthia Moy is a Principal of\nthe Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the\nFixed Income Beta Solutions Group. She joined\nthe Adviser in 2007. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201c Creation Units. \u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), Fund Shares may\ntrade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or\nless than NAV (discount). When buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondary market,\nyou may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing\nto accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201c bid-ask\nspread \u201d ). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and\ndiscounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs .\n\n19\n\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or\ncapital gains, unless you are investing\nthrough a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as\na 401(k) plan or individual retirement\naccount. Any withdrawals made from such tax-\nadvantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nSome distributions may be treated as a return\nof capital for tax purposes. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your salesperson or\nvisit your financial intermediary's website\nfor more information. 20\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg Short Term International\nTreasury Bond ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Bloomberg Short Term               \n  International                               \n  Treasury Bond ETF (the\u201cFund\u201d) seeks to      \n  provideinvestment results that, before      \n  fees and                                    \n  expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  price and                                   \n  yield performanceof an index that tracks    \n  the                                         \n  short-term (1-3 year remaining maturity)    \n  fixed                                       \n  rate, investment grade debt issuedby        \n  foreign                                     \n  governments of investment grade countries.  \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund ( \u201c Fund Shares \u201d ).

The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over \u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal\nyear, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was\n56% of the average value of its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal Investment Strategy In\nseeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg 1-3 Year Global Treasury ex-US\nCapped Index (the \u201c Index \u201d ), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that\nthe Fund is not required to purchase all of\nthe securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c\nAdviser \u201d ), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a\nsubset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index and in\nsecurities that the Adviser determines have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents\n\n21\n\nor money market instruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements and money market funds\n(including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser). The Fund may also enter into forward\ncurrency exchange contracts for hedging and/or\ninvestment purposes. Futures contracts may be\nused by the Fund in seeking performance that\ncorresponds to its Index and in managing cash\nflows. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of fixed-rate local currency\nsovereign debt of investment grade countries\noutside the United States that have remaining\nmaturities of one to three years. The Index\nincludes government bonds issued by investment\ngrade countries outside the United States, in\nlocal currencies, that have remaining\nmaturities of one to three years and are rated\ninvestment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or higher\nusing the middle rating of Moody's Investors\nService, Inc., S&P Global Ratings and Fitch\nRatings, Inc., respectively). Securities\nincluded in the Index may include securities\nthat are subject to restrictions on resale\nunder the U.S. federal securities laws ( \u201c\nrestricted securities \u201d ). Each of the\ncomponent securities in the Index is a\nconstituent of the Bloomberg Global Treasury\nex-US Index. In addition, the securities in\nthe Index must be fixed-rate and have certain\nminimum amounts outstanding, depending upon\nthe currency in which the bonds are\ndenominated. The Index is calculated by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited using a\nmodified \u201c market capitalization \u201d\nmethodology. This design ensures that each\nconstituent country within the Index is\nrepresented in a proportion consistent with\nits percentage with respect to the total\nmarket capitalization of the Index. Component\nsecurities in each constituent country are\nrepresented in a proportion consistent with\ntheir percentage relative to the other\ncomponent securities in the constituent\ncountry. The securities in the Index are\nupdated on the last business day of each\nmonth. As of February 28, 2023, a significant\nportion of the Fund comprised companies\nlocated in Europe and Japan, although this may\nchange from time to time. As of February 28,\n2023, there were approximately 294 securities\nin the Index and the dollar-weighted average\nmaturity of the securities in the Index was\n1.91 years. The Index is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Index. Principal Risks of\nInvesting in the Fund As with all investments,\nthere are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and\nyou could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\ninflation, changes in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the\nspread of infectious illness or other public\nhealth issues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments, or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets. To the extent that interest rates\nrise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally\nanticipated and the value of those securities\nmay fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels,\nthe Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield (i.e., it may lose money\non an operating basis). To the extent that\ninterest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially\nfaster than originally anticipated. If the\nprincipal on a debt obligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the prepayments of principal\nmay have to be reinvested in obligations\npaying interest at lower rates. During periods\nof falling interest rates, the income received\nby the Fund may decline. Changes in interest\nrates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a\nnon-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial\nreport standards comparable to those in the\nUnited States. Further, such entities and/or\ntheir securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility; differing securities 22\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs;\nand various administrative difficulties, such\nas delays in clearing and settling portfolio\ntransactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges\nthat are closed when the exchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is open, there may be\ndeviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed\nforeign market. These deviations could result\nin the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts\ngreater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on\nforeign markets may be less liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities traded domestically.\nForeign governments may impose restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated in a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks such as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign\nexchange transactions. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Sovereign Debt Obligations Risk:\nInvestments in debt securities issued by\ngovernments or by government agencies and\ninstrumentalities involve the risk that the\ngovernmental entities responsible for\nrepayment may be unable or unwilling to pay\ninterest and repay principal when due. Any\nrestructuring of a sovereign debt obligation\nheld by the Fund will likely have a\nsignificant adverse effect on the value of the\nobligation. In the event of default of\nsovereign debt, the Fund may be unable to\npursue legal action against the sovereign\nissuer or to realize on collateral securing\nthe debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Currency\nRisk: The value of the Fund's assets may be\naffected favorably or unfavorably by currency\nexchange rates, currency exchange control\nregulations, and delays, restrictions or\nprohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates\nmay have significant volatility, and changes\nin the values of foreign currencies against\nthe U.S. dollar may result in substantial\ndeclines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of investing in emerging\nmarkets include, among others, greater\npolitical and economic instability, greater\nvolatility in currency exchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities markets, possible trade\nbarriers, currency transfer restrictions, a\nmore limited number of potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging market country's\ndependence on revenue from particular\ncommodities or international aid, less\ngovernmental supervision and regulation,\nunavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial\nreporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for\nunfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The\nsecurities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections\nmay limit very significantly the liquidity of\nsecurities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of\nall companies in the country or region. The\nFund may be unable to liquidate its positions\nin such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater\nfor investments in frontier market countries,\nwhich typically have smaller economies or less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries. Forward Currency\nContracts Risk: In a forward currency\ncontract, the Fund agrees to buy in the future\nan amount in one currency in return for\nanother currency, at an exchange rate\ndetermined at the time the contract is entered\ninto. If currency exchange rates have moved\nagainst the Fund's position at the time the\ncontract is settled or closed, the Fund will\nlose money on the contract. There is no limit\non the extent to which exchange rates may move\nagainst the Fund's position. The markets for\ncertain currencies may at times become\nilliquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter\ninto new forward contracts or to close out\nexisting contracts. Forward currency contracts\nare entered into in the over-the-counter\nmarket, and the Fund's ability to profit from\na contract will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations under the contract. 23 Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a\nstandardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract.\nTransactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much\ngreater loss than the principal amount\ninvested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out the futures contract at a favorable\ntime or price. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract. In\nthe event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions,\nand the Fund will be unable to terminate its\nexposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between\nmovements in the prices of the futures\ncontract and movements in the price of the\nunderlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to\nmake timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its\nobligations. Geographic Focus Risk: The\nperformance of a fund that is less diversified\nacross countries or geographic regions will be\nclosely tied to market, currency, economic,\npolitical, environmental, or regulatory\nconditions and developments in the countries\nor regions in which the fund invests, and may\nbe more volatile than the performance of a\nmore geographically-diversified fund. Europe:\nDeveloped and emerging market countries in\nEurope will be significantly affected by the\nfiscal and monetary controls of the Economic\nand Monetary Union of the European Union ( \u201c\nEU \u201d ). Changes in regulations on trade,\ndecreasing imports or exports, changes in the\nexchange rate of the euro and recessions among\nEuropean countries may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other\nEuropean countries. In addition, one or more\ncountries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw\nfrom the EU. For example, on January 31, 2020,\nthe United Kingdom formally withdrew from the\nEU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and,\nafter a transition period, left the EU single\nmarket and customs union under the terms of a\nnew trade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to\ntrading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain unresolved\nand subject to further negotiation and\nagreement. The full scope and nature of the\nconsequences of the exit are not at this time\nknown and are unlikely to be known for a\nsignificant period of time. It is also unknown\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Any exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist\nattacks and additional attacks may occur in\nthe future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty\nin financial markets and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. Japan: The growth of\nJapan's economy has historically lagged that\nof its Asian neighbors and other major\ndeveloped economies. The Japanese economy is\nheavily dependent on international trade and\nhas been adversely affected by trade tariffs,\nother protectionist measures, competition from\nemerging economies and the economic conditions\nof its trading partners. China has become an\nimportant trading partner with Japan, yet the\ncountries' political relationship has become\nstrained. Should political tension increase,\nit could adversely affect the economy,\nespecially the export sector, and destabilize\nthe region as a whole. Japan also remains\nheavily dependent on oil imports, and higher\ncommodity prices could therefore have a\nnegative impact on the economy. The Japanese\nyen has fluctuated widely at times and any\nincrease in its value may cause a decline in\nexports that could weaken the Japanese\neconomy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in\nthe currency markets to attempt to maintain or\nreduce the value of the yen. Japanese\nintervention in the currency markets could\ncause the value of the yen to fluctuate\nsharply and unpredictably and could cause\nlosses to investors. Japan has an aging\nworkforce and has experienced a significant\npopulation decline in recent years. Japan's\nlabor market appears to be undergoing\nfundamental structural changes, as a labor\nmarket traditionally accustomed to lifetime\nemployment adjusts to meet the need for\nincreased labor mobility, which may adversely\naffect Japan's economic competitiveness.\nNatural disasters, such as earthquakes,\nvolcanoes, typhoons or tsunamis, could occur\nin Japan or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Japanese economy and, in\nturn, the Fund. Income Risk: The Fund's income\nmay decline due to falling interest rates or\nother factors. Issuers of securities held by\nthe Fund may call or redeem the securities\nduring periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest\nin securities paying lower interest rates. If\nan obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in\nother obligations paying income at lower\nrates. 24 Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy.\nThe structure and composition of the Index\nwill affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to\ntime and may not be identified and corrected\nby the Index Provider for a period of time or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. To the extent\ncircumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and\nthe Fund may therefore hold for a period of\ntime, securities of companies that do not\nalign with the Index's objective and/or\ncriteria. When there are changes made to the\ncomponent securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its\nportfolio, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes\nwill be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as\na result of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to distribute any such\ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse\nfederal income tax consequences. While the\nAdviser seeks to track the performance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The\nFund incurs a number of operating expenses not\napplicable to the Index, and incurs costs in\nbuying and selling securities. In addition,\nthe Fund may not be fully invested at times,\ngenerally as a result of cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or reserves of cash held by\nthe Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing\nin fewer than all of the securities in the\nIndex, or in some securities not included in\nthe Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that\nof the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIf the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could\nresult in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on\ninvestments in any illiquid investments and/or\nthe difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its\ndesired level of exposure to a certain market\nor sector. Non-Diversification Risk: As a \u201c\nnon-diversified \u201d fund, the Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively small number of\nissuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may\naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund\nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome diversified for periods of time solely\nas a result of tracking the Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Restricted Securities Risk: The\nFund may hold securities that have not been\nregistered for sale to the public under the\nU.S. federal securities laws. There can be no\nassurance that a trading market will exist at\nany time for any particular restricted\nsecurity. Limitations on the resale of these\nsecurities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from\ndisposing of them promptly at reasonable\nprices. The Fund may have to bear the expense\nof registering the securities for resale and\nthe risk of substantial delays in effecting\nthe registration. Also, restricted securities\nmay be difficult to value because market\nquotations may not be readily available, and\nthe securities may have significant\nvolatility. Valuation Risk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of the\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201c fair\nvalued \u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time. 25\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing changes in\nthe Fund's performance from year to year and\nby showing how the Fund's average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with\nthe average annual returns of the Index and of\na relevant broad-based securities index. The\nFund's past performance (before and after\ntaxes) is not necessarily an indication of how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information is available by\ncalling 1-866-787-2257or visiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.com/spdrs .

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts.

Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201c Creation Units. \u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), Fund Shares may\ntrade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or\nless than NAV (discount). When buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n26\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund\nShares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201c\nbid-ask spread \u201d ). Recent information\nregarding the Fund's NAV, market price,\npremiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Tax\nInformation The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or\ncapital gains, unless you are investing\nthrough a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as\na 401(k) plan or individual retirement\naccount. Any withdrawals made from such tax-\nadvantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nSome distributions may be treated as a return\nof capital for tax purposes. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your salesperson or\nvisit your financial intermediary's website\nfor more information. 27\n\nSPDR \u00ae FTSE International Government\nInflation-Protected Bond ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR FTSE International Government      \n  Inflation-Protected Bond ETF (the\u201cFund\u201d)    \n  seeks to                                    \n  provideinvestment results that, before      \n  fees and                                    \n  expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  price and                                   \n  yield performanceof an index that tracks    \n  the                                         \n  inflation protected sector of the global    \n  bond                                        \n  market outside the United States.           \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund ( \u201c Fund Shares \u201d ). You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.50%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses1                      0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.50%  \n  expenses1                                   \n                                              \n1 The Fund's \u201c Other expenses \u201d and \u201c Total\nannual Fund operating expenses \u201d have been\nrestated to reflect current fees. Example:\nThis Example is intended to help you compare\nthe cost of investing in the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated, and then sell\nor hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $51       $160    $280     $628  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over \u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal\nyear, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was\n37% of the average value of its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal Investment Strategy In\nseeking to track the performance of the FTSE\nInternational Inflation-Linked Securities\nSelect Index (the \u201c Index \u201d ), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that\nthe Fund is not required to purchase all of\nthe securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c\nAdviser \u201d ), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a\nsubset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index and in\nsecurities that the Adviser determines have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments, such as repurchase agreements and\nmoney market funds (including money market\n\n28\n\nfunds advised by the Adviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries, but only to the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries. The Fund may use\nderivatives, including credit default swaps\nand credit default index swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure that the Adviser expects\nto correlate closely with the Index, or a\nportion of the Index, and in managing cash\nflows. The Index is designed to measure the\ntotal return performance of inflation-linked\nbonds outside the United States with fixed-\nrate coupon payments that are linked to an\ninflation index. Inflation-protected public\nobligations of the inflation-linked government\nbond markets of developed and emerging market\ncountries, commonly known in the United States\nas TIPS, are securities issued by such\ngovernments that are designed to provide\ninflation protection to investors. The Index\nincludes government debt (direct obligations\nof the issuer country) but does not include\nquasi-government debt or corporate debt. To be\nincluded in the Index, bonds must be linked to\nan inflation index and (i) meet a country-\nspecific minimum issue size, depending on the\ncurrency in which the issue is denominated;\n(ii) have a fixed-rate stated coupon; (iii)\nhave at least one year remaining to maturity\nat the Index rebalancing date; (iv) settle on\nor before the Index rebalancing date; and (v)\nbe rated at least C by S&P Global Ratings ( \u201c\nS&P \u201d ) or at least Ca by Moody's Investors\nService, Inc. (excluding defaulted issuers).\nSecurities included in the Index may include\nsecurities that are subject to restrictions on\nresale under the U.S. federal securities laws\n( \u201c restricted securities \u201d ). The Index is a\nmarket-value weight, capped total return\nindex, in which the maximum market\ncapitalization-based weights of each\nindividual country in the Index cannot exceed\n22.5% of the total Index weight. The total\nmarket weights of countries with more than\n4.6% market weight in the Index cannot\ncollectively exceed 45% of the total Index\nweight and the number of countries with more\nthan 4.6% market weight in the Index can be no\nless than five. If the combined weights of\neach country with more than 4.6% market weight\nexceeds 45% of the total Index weight, then\nthe weights of those countries are reduced in\nproportion to each country's market\ncapitalizations until they sum to 45%, and the\nweights of the remaining smaller countries are\nincreased in proportion to each country's\nmarket capitalizations by the same amount.\nAfter the country weights are determined,\nconstituents within each country are assigned\nweights in proportion to their market\ncapitalization. When an issuer defaults, is\nassigned a D rating by S&P, or enters into\nChapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection\nin the U.S. (or equivalent in its local\nmarket), its bonds remain in the Index until\nthe end of the month. The Index is rebalanced\nmonthly, on the last day of the month.\nCountries covered in the Index as of February\n28, 2023 comprised: Australia, Brazil, Canada,\nChile, Colombia, France, Germany, Israel,\nItaly, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South\nAfrica, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and\nthe United Kingdom, although this may change\nfrom time to time. As of February 28, 2023, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised\ncompanies located in Europe and the United\nKingdom, although this may change from time to\ntime. As of February 28, 2023, there were\napproximately 172 securities in the Index. The\nIndex is sponsored by FTSE Russell (the \u201c\nIndex Provider \u201d ), which is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the Adviser. The Index\nProvider determines the composition of the\nIndex, relative weightings of the securities\nin the Index and publishes information\nregarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks\nof investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will\nchange in value, and you could lose money by\ninvesting in the Fund. An investment in the\nFund is not insured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any\nother government agency. Market Risk: The\nFund's investments are subject to changes in\ngeneral economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in\ninvestment in securities markets. Investment\nmarkets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to,\neconomic growth or recession, changes in\ninterest rates, inflation, changes in the\nactual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the risk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt securities markets and\nadversely affect global economies and markets.\nLocal, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural\ndisasters, the spread of infectious illness or\nother public health issues, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or\ndecrease as a result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments, or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets. To the extent that interest rates\nrise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally\nanticipated and the value of those securities\nmay fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels,\nthe Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield (i.e., it may lose money\non an 29 operating basis). To the extent that\ninterest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially\nfaster than originally anticipated. If the\nprincipal on a debt obligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the prepayments of principal\nmay have to be reinvested in obligations\npaying interest at lower rates. During periods\nof falling interest rates, the income received\nby the Fund may decline. Changes in interest\nrates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a\nnon-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial\nreport standards comparable to those in the\nUnited States. Further, such entities and/or\ntheir securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility; differing securities market\nstructures; higher transaction costs; and\nvarious administrative difficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and settling portfolio\ntransactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges\nthat are closed when the exchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is open, there may be\ndeviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed\nforeign market. These deviations could result\nin the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts\ngreater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on\nforeign markets may be less liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities traded domestically.\nForeign governments may impose restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated in a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks such as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign\nexchange transactions. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Inflation-Indexed Securities Risk: The\nprincipal amount of an inflation-indexed\nsecurity typically increases with inflation\nand decreases with deflation, as measured by a\nspecified index. It is possible that, in a\nperiod of declining inflation rates, the Fund\ncould receive at maturity less than the\ninitial principal amount of an inflation-\nindexed security. Changes in the values of\ninflation-indexed securities may be difficult\nto predict, and it is possible that an\ninvestment in such securities will have an\neffect different from that anticipated.\nSovereign Debt Obligations Risk: Investments\nin debt securities issued by governments or by\ngovernment agencies and instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that the governmental\nentities responsible for repayment may be\nunable or unwilling to pay interest and repay\nprincipal when due. Any restructuring of a\nsovereign debt obligation held by the Fund\nwill likely have a significant adverse effect\non the value of the obligation. In the event\nof default of sovereign debt, the Fund may be\nunable to pursue legal action against the\nsovereign issuer or to realize on collateral\nsecuring the debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares\nmay be bought and sold in the secondary market\nat market prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Below\nInvestment-Grade Securities Risk: Lower-\nquality debt securities ( \u201c high yield \u201d or \u201c\njunk \u201d bonds) are considered predominantly\nspeculative, and can involve a substantially\ngreater risk of default than higher quality\ndebt securities. Issuers of lower-quality debt\nsecurities may have substantially greater risk\nof insolvency or bankruptcy than issuers of\nhigher-quality debt securities. They can be\nilliquid, and their values can have\nsignificant volatility and may decline\nsignificantly over short periods of time.\nLower-quality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or\nthe market or economy in general. Currency\nRisk: The value of the Fund's assets may be\naffected favorably or unfavorably by currency\nexchange rates, currency exchange control\nregulations, and delays, restrictions or\nprohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates\nmay have significant volatility, and changes\nin the values of foreign currencies against\nthe U.S. dollar may result in substantial\ndeclines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies. 30 Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of investing in emerging\nmarkets include, among others, greater\npolitical and economic instability, greater\nvolatility in currency exchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities markets, possible trade\nbarriers, currency transfer restrictions, a\nmore limited number of potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging market country's\ndependence on revenue from particular\ncommodities or international aid, less\ngovernmental supervision and regulation,\nunavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial\nreporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for\nunfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The\nsecurities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections\nmay limit very significantly the liquidity of\nsecurities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of\nall companies in the country or region. The\nFund may be unable to liquidate its positions\nin such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater\nfor investments in frontier market countries,\nwhich typically have smaller economies or less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries. Geographic Focus\nRisk: The performance of a fund that is less\ndiversified across countries or geographic\nregions will be closely tied to market,\ncurrency, economic, political, environmental,\nor regulatory conditions and developments in\nthe countries or regions in which the fund\ninvests, and may be more volatile than the\nperformance of a more geographically-\ndiversified fund. Europe: Developed and\nemerging market countries in Europe will be\nsignificantly affected by the fiscal and\nmonetary controls of the Economic and Monetary\nUnion of the European Union ( \u201c EU \u201d ).\nChanges in regulations on trade, decreasing\nimports or exports, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro and recessions among European\ncountries may have a significant adverse\neffect on the economies of other European\ncountries. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. For example, on January 31, 2020, the\nUnited Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU\n(commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and,\nafter a transition period, left the EU single\nmarket and customs union under the terms of a\nnew trade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to\ntrading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain unresolved\nand subject to further negotiation and\nagreement. The full scope and nature of the\nconsequences of the exit are not at this time\nknown and are unlikely to be known for a\nsignificant period of time. It is also unknown\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Any exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist\nattacks and additional attacks may occur in\nthe future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty\nin financial markets and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. United Kingdom: The United\nKingdom has one of the largest economies in\nEurope, and the United States and other\nEuropean countries are substantial trading\npartners of the United Kingdom. As a result,\nthe British economy may be impacted by changes\nto the economic condition of the United States\nand other European countries. The British\neconomy relies heavily on the export of\nfinancial services to the United States and\nother European countries and, therefore, a\nprolonged slowdown in the financial services\nsector may have a negative impact on the\nBritish economy. Continued governmental\ninvolvement or control in certain sectors may\nstifle competition in certain sectors or cause\nadverse effects on economic growth. On January\n31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew\nfrom the EU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit\n\u201d ) and, after a transition period, left the\nEU single market and customs union under the\nterms of a new trade agreement on December 31,\n2020. The agreement governs the new\nrelationship between the United Kingdom and EU\nwith respect to trading goods and services,\nbut critical aspects of the relationship\nremain unresolved and subject to further\nnegotiation and agreement. There is still\nconsiderable uncertainty relating to the\npotential consequences associated with the\nexit and whether the United Kingdom's exit\nwill increase the likelihood of other\ncountries also departing the EU. Any exits\nfrom the EU, or the possibility of such exits,\nmay have a significant impact on the United\nKingdom, Europe, and global economies, which\nmay result in increased volatility and\nilliquidity, new legal and regulatory\nuncertainties and potentially lower economic\ngrowth for these economies that could\npotentially have an adverse effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. In addition,\nthe United Kingdom has been a target of\nterrorism in the past. Acts of terrorism in\nthe United Kingdom or against British\ninterests abroad may cause uncertainty in the\nBritish financial markets and adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. 31 Income Risk: The Fund's\nincome may decline due to falling interest\nrates or other factors. Issuers of securities\nheld by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest\nrates, and the Fund would likely be required\nto reinvest in securities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest\nthe prepayment in other obligations paying\nincome at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy.\nThe structure and composition of the Index\nwill affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to\ntime and may not be identified and corrected\nby the Index Provider for a period of time or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. To the extent\ncircumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and\nthe Fund may therefore hold for a period of\ntime, securities of companies that do not\nalign with the Index's objective and/or\ncriteria. When there are changes made to the\ncomponent securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its\nportfolio, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes\nwill be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as\na result of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to distribute any such\ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse\nfederal income tax consequences. While the\nAdviser seeks to track the performance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The\nFund incurs a number of operating expenses not\napplicable to the Index, and incurs costs in\nbuying and selling securities. In addition,\nthe Fund may not be fully invested at times,\ngenerally as a result of cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or reserves of cash held by\nthe Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing\nin fewer than all of the securities in the\nIndex, or in some securities not included in\nthe Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that\nof the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIf the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could\nresult in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on\ninvestments in any illiquid investments and/or\nthe difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its\ndesired level of exposure to a certain market\nor sector. Non-Diversification Risk: As a \u201c\nnon-diversified \u201d fund, the Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively small number of\nissuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may\naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund\nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome diversified for periods of time solely\nas a result of tracking the Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Restricted Securities Risk: The\nFund may hold securities that have not been\nregistered for sale to the public under the\nU.S. federal securities laws. There can be no\nassurance that a trading market will exist at\nany time for any particular restricted\nsecurity. Limitations on the resale of these\nsecurities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from\ndisposing of them promptly at reasonable\nprices. The Fund may have to bear the expense\nof registering the securities for resale and\nthe risk of substantial delays in effecting\nthe registration. Also, restricted securities\nmay be difficult to value because market\nquotations may not be readily available, and\nthe securities may have significant\nvolatility. Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party\ncontract that generally obligates the parties\nto exchange payments based on a specified\nreference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can\ninvolve greater risks than direct investment\nin securities because swaps may be leveraged\nand are subject to counterparty risk (e.g.,\nthe risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and\npricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to\nvalue). It may not be possible for the Fund to\nliquidate a swap position at an advantageous\ntime or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. 32\n\nValuation Risk: Some portfolio holdings,\npotentially a large portion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio, may be valued on the\nbasis of factors other than market quotations.\nThis may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a\nportfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201c fair\nvalued \u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time. Fund Performance The following bar\nchart and table provide an indication of the\nrisks of investing in the Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average\nannual returns for certain time periods\ncompare with the average annual returns of the\nIndex and of a relevant broad-based securities\nindex. The Fund's past performance (before and\nafter taxes) is not necessarily an indication\nof how the Fund will perform in the\nfuture.Updated performance information is\navailable by calling 1-866-787-2257or visiting\nour website at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs .\nAnnual Total Returns (years ended 12/31)\nHighest Quarterly Return: 9.29% ( Q4, 2020)\nLowest Quarterly Return:- 13.99% ( Q2, 2022)\n\nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/22) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes. Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective February 12, 2016 (the \u201c\nBenchmark Index Change Date \u201d ), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the DB Global\nGovernment ex-U.S. Inflation-Linked Bond\nCapped Index (the \u201c Previous Benchmark Index \u201d\n) to the FTSE International Inflation-Linked\nSecurities Select Index, consistent with a\nchange in the Fund's principal investment\nstrategy to track the performance of the\ncurrent index. Performance of the Fund prior\nto the Benchmark Index Change Date is\ntherefore based on the Fund's investment\nstrategy to track the Previous Benchmark\nIndex.\n                                              \n                OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return        -15.41%  -2.12%     -1.09%    \n  Before Taxes                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on      -17.91%  -3.35%     -2.03%    \n  Distributio\u2026                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributio\u2026  -9.03%   -2.00%     -1.11%    \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  FTSE                                        \n  Internation\u2026                                \n  Inflation-L\u2026                                \n  Securities                                  \n  Select                                      \n  Index/DB                                    \n  Global                                      \n  Government    -14.78%  -1.53%     -0.53%    \n  ex-U.S.Infl\u2026                                \n  Bond Capped                                 \n  Index1,2(re\u2026                                \n  no deduction                                \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses                                    \n  or taxes)                                   \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  Global                                      \n  Aggregate                                   \n  Bond Index                                  \n  (reflects no  -16.25%  -1.66%     -0.44%    \n  deduction                                   \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the Index\nfor periods beginning on the Benchmark Index\nChange Date and the Previous Benchmark Index\nfor periods prior to the Benchmark Index\nChange Date. 2 Prior to May 31, 2018, the FTSE\nInternational Inflation-Linked Securities\nSelect Index was named the Citi International\nInflation-Linked Securities Select Index.\nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are James Kramer,\nCynthia Moy and Joanna Madden. James Kramer is\na Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1996. Cynthia Moy is a Principal of the\nAdviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed\nIncome Beta Solutions Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2007.\n\n33\n\nJoanna Madden is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed\nIncome Beta Solutions Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2003. Purchase and Sale Information\nThe Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in\nlarge blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201c\nCreation Units. \u201d Creation Unit transactions\nare conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), Fund Shares may\ntrade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or\nless than NAV (discount). When buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondary market,\nyou may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing\nto accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201c bid-ask\nspread \u201d ). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and\ndiscounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Some\ndistributions may be treated as a return of\ncapital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such\nas a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n34 Additional Strategies Information Principal\nStrategies General . Please see each Fund's \u201c\nThe Fund's Principal Investment Strategy \u201d\nsection under \u201c Fund Summaries \u201d above for a\ndiscussion of each Fund's principal investment\nstrategies. A Fund may invest in various types\nof securities and engage in various investment\ntechniques which are not the principal focus\nof the Fund and therefore are not described in\nthis Prospectus. These securities, techniques\nand practices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional\nInformation (the \u201c SAI \u201d ), which you may\nobtain free of charge by contacting\nshareholder services (see the back cover of\nthis Prospectus for the address and phone\nnumber). The Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of each Fund's Index as closely as\npossible (i.e ., obtain a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index). A number of\nfactors may affect a Fund's ability to achieve\na high degree of correlation with its Index,\nand there can be no guarantee that a Fund will\nachieve a high degree of correlation. For\nexample, a Fund may not be able to achieve a\nhigh degree of correlation with its Index when\nthere are practical difficulties or\nsubstantial costs involved in compiling a\nportfolio of securities to follow the Index,\nwhen a security in the Index becomes\ntemporarily illiquid, unavailable or less\nliquid, or legal restrictions exist that\nprohibit the Fund from investing in a security\nin the Index. The Adviser will utilize a\nsampling strategy in managing the Funds.\nSampling means that the Adviser uses\nquantitative analysis to select securities,\nincluding securities in the Index, outside of\nthe Index and derivatives that have a similar\ninvestment profile as the relevant Index in\nterms of key risk factors, performance\nattributes and other economic characteristics.\nThese include industry weightings, market\ncapitalization, and other financial\ncharacteristics of securities. The quantity of\nholdings in a Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nIn addition, from time to time, securities are\nadded to or removed from each Index. The\nAdviser may sell securities that are\nrepresented in an Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in an\nIndex, in anticipation of their removal from\nor addition to an Index. Further, the Adviser\nmay choose to overweight securities in an\nIndex, purchase or sell securities not in an\nIndex, or utilize various combinations of\nother available techniques, in seeking to\ntrack an Index. Each Fund has adopted a non-\nfundamental investment policy to invest at\nleast 80% of its respective net assets, plus\nthe amount of borrowings for investment\npurposes, in investments suggested by its\nname, measured at the time of investment. A\nFund will provide shareholders with at least\n60 days' notice prior to any change in this\nnon-fundamental 80% investment policy. The\nBoard of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201c Board \u201d\n) may change a Fund's investment strategy,\nIndex and other policies without shareholder\napproval, except as otherwise indicated in\nthis Prospectus or in the SAI. The Board may\nalso change a Fund's investment objective\nwithout shareholder approval. Non-Principal\nStrategies Certain Other Investments . Each\nFund may invest in structured notes (notes on\nwhich the amount of principal repayment and\ninterest payments are based on the movement of\none or more specified factors such as the\nmovement of a particular security or index),\nswaps, options and futures contracts. Swaps,\noptions and futures contracts and structured\nnotes may be used by a Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to its Index and\nin managing cash flows. Temporary Defensive\nPositions . In certain situations or market\nconditions, a Fund may temporarily depart from\nits normal investment policies and strategies,\nprovided that the alternative is consistent\nwith the Fund's investment objective and is in\nthe best interest of the Fund. For example, a\nFund may make larger than normal investments\nin derivatives to maintain exposure to its\nIndex if it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . Each\nFund may borrow money from a bank as permitted\nby the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended ( \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ), or other governing\nstatute, by the rules thereunder, or by the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( \u201c\nSEC \u201d ) or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund, but only for\ntemporary or emergency purposes. The 1940 Act\npresently allows a Fund to borrow from any\nbank (including pledging, mortgaging or\nhypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33\n1/3% of its total assets (not including\ntemporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of\nits total assets). A Fund may also invest in\nreverse repurchase agreements or similar\nfinancing transactions. Consistent with a rule\nunder the 1940 Act, a Fund may treat such\ninvestments as either borrowings or\nderivatives 35 transactions. To the extent a\nFund treats reverse repurchase agreements or\nsimilar financing transactions as borrowings,\nsuch investments will also be included in the\n33 1/3% limit. Under normal circumstances, any\nborrowings by a Fund (including investments in\nreverse repurchase agreements or similar\nfinancing transactions treated as borrowings)\nwill not exceed 10% of the Fund's total\nassets. Lending of Securities . Each Fund may\nlend its portfolio securities in an amount not\nto exceed 40% of the value of its net assets\nvia a securities lending program through its\nsecurities lending agent, State Street Bank\nand Trust Company ( \u201c State Street \u201d or the \u201c\nLending Agent \u201d ), to brokers, dealers and\nother financial institutions desiring to\nborrow securities to complete transactions and\nfor other purposes. A securities lending\nprogram allows a Fund to receive a portion of\nthe income generated by lending its securities\nand investing the respective collateral. A\nFund will receive collateral for each loaned\nsecurity which is at least equal to the market\nvalue of that security, marked to market each\ntrading day. To the extent a Fund receives\ncash collateral, as of the date of this\nProspectus, the Adviser expects to invest such\ncash collateral in a fund managed by the\nAdviser that invests in: a broad range of\nmoney market instruments; certificates of\ndeposit and time deposits of U.S. and foreign\nbanks; commercial paper and other high quality\nobligations of U.S. or foreign companies;\nasset-backed securities; mortgage-related\nsecurities; repurchase agreements; and shares\nof money market funds. In the securities\nlending program, the borrower generally has\nthe right to vote the loaned securities;\nhowever, a Fund may call loans to vote proxies\nif a material issue affecting the Fund's\neconomic interest in the investment is to be\nvoted upon. Security loans may be terminated\nat any time by a Fund.

(commonly known as \u201c high-yield \u201d or \u201c\njunk \u201d bonds) lack strong investment-grade\ncharacteristics, are considered predominantly\nspeculative with respect to the issuer's\ncontinuing ability to make principal and\ninterest payments, and are subject to greater\nlevels of credit, liquidity and market risk\nthan higher-rated securities. They can involve\na substantially greater risk of default than\nhigher-rated securities, and their values can\ndecline significantly over short periods of\ntime. Issuers of lower-quality debt securities\nmay have substantially greater risk of\ninsolvency or bankruptcy than issuers of\nhigher-quality debt securities. In the event\nthe issuer of a debt security held by a Fund\ndefaults on its payments or becomes insolvent\nor bankrupt, the Fund may not receive the\nreturn it was promised on the investment and\ncould lose its entire investment. The lower\nratings of junk bonds reflect a greater\npossibility that actual or perceived adverse\nchanges in the financial condition of the\nissuer or in general economic conditions, or\nan unanticipated rise in interest rates, may\nimpair the ability of the issuer to make\npayments of interest and principal. If this\nwere to occur, the values of such securities\nheld by a Fund may fall substantially and a\nFund could lose some or all of the value of\nits investment. Lower-quality debt securities\ntend to be more sensitive to adverse news\nabout the issuer, or the market or economy in\ngeneral, than higher quality debt securities.\nThe market for lower quality debt securities\ncan be less liquid than for higher quality\ndebt securities, especially during periods of\nrecession or general market decline, which\ncould make it difficult at times for a Fund to\nsell certain securities at prices used in\ncalculating a Fund's net asset value. These\nsecurities may have significant volatility.\nCall/Prepayment Risk . Call/prepayment risk is\nthe risk that an issuer will exercise its\nright to pay principal on an obligation held\nby a Fund earlier than expected or required.\nThis may occur, for example, when there is a\ndecline in interest rates, and an issuer of\nbonds or preferred stock redeems the bonds or\nstock in order to replace them with\nobligations on which it is required to pay a\nlower interest or dividend rate. It may also\noccur when there is an unanticipated increase\nin the rate at which mortgages or other\nreceivables underlying mortgage- or asset-\nbacked securities held by a Fund are prepaid.\nIn any such case, a Fund may be forced to\ninvest the prepaid amounts in lower-yielding\ninvestments, resulting in a decline in the\nFund's income. Counterparty Risk . A Fund will\nbe subject to credit risk with respect to the\ncounterparties with which the Fund enters into\nderivatives contracts and other transactions\nsuch as repurchase agreements or reverse\nrepurchase agreements. A Fund's ability to\nprofit from these types of investments and\ntransactions will depend on the willingness\nand ability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations. If a counterparty fails to meet\nits contractual obligations, a Fund may be\nunable to terminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss\nto the Fund. A Fund may experience significant\ndelays in obtaining any recovery in an\ninsolvency, bankruptcy, or other\nreorganization proceeding involving its\ncounterparty (including recovery of any\ncollateral posted by it) and may obtain only a\nlimited recovery or may obtain no recovery in\nsuch circumstances. If a Fund holds collateral\nposted by its counterparty, it may be delayed\nor prevented from realizing on the collateral\nin the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceeding relating to the counterparty. Under\napplicable law or contractual provisions,\nincluding if a Fund enters into an investment\nor transaction with a financial institution\nand such financial institution (or an\naffiliate of the financial institution)\nexperiences financial difficulties, then the\nFund may in certain situations be prevented or\ndelayed from exercising its rights to\nterminate the investment or transaction, or to\nrealize on any collateral and may result in\nthe suspension of payment and delivery\nobligations of the parties under such\ninvestment or transactions or in another\ninstitution being substituted for that\nfinancial institution without the consent of\nthe Fund. Further, a Fund may be subject to \u201c\nbail-in \u201d risk under applicable law whereby,\nif required by the financial institution's\nauthority, the financial institution's\nliabilities could be written down, eliminated\nor converted into equity or an alternative\ninstrument of ownership. A bail-in of a\nfinancial institution may result in a\nreduction in value of some or all of its\nsecurities and, if a Fund holds such\nsecurities or has entered into a transaction\nwith such a financial security when a bail-in\noccurs, such Fund may also be similarly\nimpacted. Credit Risk . Credit risk is the\nrisk that an issuer, guarantor or liquidity\nprovider of a fixed-income security held by a\nFund may be unable or unwilling, or may be\nperceived (whether by market participants,\nratings agencies, pricing services or\notherwise) as unable or unwilling, to make\ntimely principal and/or interest payments, or\nto otherwise honor its obligations. It\nincludes the risk that the security will be\ndowngraded by a credit rating agency;\ngenerally, lower credit quality issuers\npresent higher credit risks. An actual or\nperceived decline in creditworthiness of an\nissuer of a fixed-income security held by a\nFund may result in a decrease in the value of\nthe security. It is possible that the ability\nof an issuer to meet its obligations will\ndecline substantially during the period when a\nFund owns securities of the issuer or that the\nissuer will default on its obligations or that\nthe obligations of the issuer will be limited\nor restructured. 39 The credit rating assigned\nto any particular investment does not\nnecessarily reflect the issuer's current\nfinancial condition and does not reflect an\nassessment of an investment's volatility or\nliquidity. Securities rated in the lowest\ncategory of investment-grade are considered to\nhave speculative characteristics. If a\nsecurity held by a Fund loses its rating or\nits rating is downgraded, the Fund may\nnonetheless continue to hold the security in\nthe discretion of the Adviser. In the case of\nasset-backed or mortgage-related securities,\nchanges in the actual or perceived ability of\nthe obligors on the underlying assets or\nmortgages to make payments of interest and/or\nprincipal may affect the values of those\nsecurities. Currency Risk . Investments in\nissuers in different countries are often\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar. Changes in the values of those\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar may\nhave a positive or negative effect on the\nvalues of a Fund's investments denominated in\nthose currencies. The values of other\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar may\nfluctuate in response to, among other factors,\ninterest rate changes, intervention (or\nfailure to intervene) by national governments,\ncentral banks, or supranational entities such\nas the International Monetary Fund, the\nimposition of currency controls, and other\npolitical or regulatory developments. Currency\nvalues can decrease significantly both in the\nshort term and over the long term in response\nto these and other developments. Continuing\nuncertainty as to the status of the Euro and\nthe Economic and Monetary Union of the\nEuropean Union (the \u201c EMU \u201d ) has created\nsignificant volatility in currency and\nfinancial markets generally. Any partial or\ncomplete dissolution of the EMU, or any\ncontinued uncertainty as to its status, could\nhave significant adverse effects on currency\nand financial markets, and on the values of a\nFund's portfolio investments. Debt Securities\nRisk . The values of debt securities may\nincrease or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability\nor unwillingness of issuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments or illiquidity\nin debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially\nslower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the\nvalue of a Fund's fixed income securities to\ndecrease, a decline in a Fund's income and\nyield, an adverse impact on the liquidity of a\nFund's fixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels,\na Fund's yield can be low, and a Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). To the extent that\ninterest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially\nfaster than originally anticipated. If the\nprincipal on a debt obligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the prepayments of principal\nmay have to be reinvested in obligations\npaying interest at lower rates. During periods\nof falling interest rates, the income received\nby a Fund may decline. Changes in interest\nrates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. The U.S. Federal Reserve has been\nengaged in an aggressive campaign to raise\ninterest rates in an effort to combat\nhistorically high levels of inflation.\nInterest rate increases may continue. High\nlevels of inflation and/or a significantly\nchanging interest rate environment can lead to\nheightened levels of volatility and reduced\nliquidity. Derivatives Risk. A derivative is a\nfinancial contract the value of which depends\non, or is derived from, the value of an\nunderlying asset, interest rate, or index.\nDerivative transactions typically involve\nleverage and may have significant volatility.\nIt is possible that a derivative transaction\nwill result in a loss greater than the\nprincipal amount invested, and a Fund may not\nbe able to close out a derivative transaction\nat a favorable time or price. Risks associated\nwith derivative instruments include potential\nchanges in value in response to interest rate\nchanges or other market developments or as a\nresult of the counterparty's credit quality;\nthe potential for the derivative transaction\nnot to have the effect the Adviser anticipated\nor a different or less favorable effect than\nthe Adviser anticipated; the failure of the\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction to\nperform its obligations under the transaction\nor to settle a trade; possible mispricing or\nimproper valuation of the derivative\ninstrument; imperfect correlation in the value\nof a derivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that a\nFund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be\nable to recover the collateral or margin in\nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or\nbankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will\nexperience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative instrument, including, without\nlimitation, absence of a secondary trading\nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to a\nFund due to losses on the transaction and an\nincrease in volatility; the potential for the\nderivative transaction to have the effect of\naccelerating the recognition of gain; and\nlegal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction. 40\nForward Currency Contracts Risk . In a forward\ncurrency contract, a Fund agrees to buy in the\nfuture an amount in one currency in return for\nanother currency, at an exchange rate\ndetermined at the time the contract is entered\ninto. If currency exchange rates have moved\nagainst the Fund's position at the time the\ncontract is settled or closed, the Fund will\nlose money on the contract. There is no limit\non the extent to which exchange rates may move\nagainst a Fund's position. The markets for\ncertain currencies may at times become\nilliquid, and a Fund may be unable to enter\ninto new forward contracts or to close out\nexisting contracts. Forward currency contracts\nare entered into in the over-the-counter\nmarket, and a Fund's ability to profit from a\ncontract will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations under the contract. Use by a Fund\nof foreign currency forward contracts may give\nrise to investment leverage. Futures Contract\nRisk . The risk of loss relating to the use of\nfutures contracts is potentially unlimited.\nThe ability to establish and close out\npositions in futures contracts will be subject\nto the development and maintenance of a liquid\nsecondary market. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract or\nat any particular time. In the event no such\nmarket exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and a Fund will\nbe unable to terminate the futures contract.\nIn using futures contracts, a Fund will be\nreliant on the ability of the Adviser to\npredict market and price movements correctly;\nthe skills needed to use such futures\ncontracts successfully are different from\nthose needed for traditional portfolio\nmanagement. If a Fund uses futures contracts\nfor hedging purposes, there is a risk of\nimperfect correlation between movements in the\nprices of the futures contracts and movements\nin the securities or index underlying the\nfutures contracts or movements in the prices\nof the Fund's investments that are the subject\nof such hedge. The prices of futures\ncontracts, for a number of reasons, may not\ncorrelate perfectly with movements in the\nsecurities or index underlying them. For\nexample, participants in the futures markets\nare subject to margin deposit requirements.\nSuch requirements may cause investors to take\nactions with respect to their futures\npositions that they would not otherwise take.\nThe margin requirements in the futures markets\nmay be less onerous than margin requirements\nin the securities markets in general, and as a\nresult those markets may attract more\nspeculators than the securities markets do.\nIncreased participation by speculators in\nthose markets may cause temporary price\ndistortions. Due to the possibility of price\ndistortion, even a correct forecast of general\nmarket trends by the Adviser still may not\nresult in a successful futures activity over a\nvery short time period. The risk of a position\nin a futures contract may be very large\ncompared to the relatively low level of margin\na Fund is required to deposit. A Fund will\ntypically be required to post margin with its\nfutures commission merchant in connection with\nits transactions in futures contracts. In many\ncases, a relatively small price movement in a\nfutures contract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. A Fund will incur brokerage fees in\nconnection with its futures transactions. In\nthe event of an insolvency of the futures\ncommission merchant or a clearing house, a\nFund may not be able to recover all (or any)\nof the margin it has posted with the futures\ncommission merchant, or to realize the value\nof any increase in the price of its positions,\nor it may experience a significant delay in\ndoing so. The Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) and the various\nexchanges have established limits referred to\nas \u201c speculative position limits \u201d on the\nmaximum net long or net short positions that\nany person and certain affiliated entities may\nhold or control in a particular futures\ncontract. In addition, federal position limits\napply to swaps that are economically\nequivalent to futures contracts that are\nsubject to CFTC-set speculative limits. All\npositions owned or controlled by the same\nperson or entity, even if in different\naccounts, must be aggregated for purposes of\ncomplying with position limits. It is possible\nthat the positions of different clients\nmanaged by the Adviser may be aggregated for\nthis purpose. Therefore, the trading decisions\nof the Adviser may have to be modified and\npositions held by a Fund liquidated in order\nto avoid exceeding such limits. The\nmodification of investment decisions or the\nelimination of open positions, if it occurs,\nmay adversely affect the performance of a\nFund. A violation of position limits could\nalso lead to regulatory action materially\nadverse to a Fund's investment strategy. In\naddition, exchanges may establish\naccountability levels applicable to a futures\ncontract instead of position limits, provided\nthat the futures contract is not subject to\nfederal position limits. An exchange may order\na person who holds or controls a position in\nexcess of a position accountability level not\nto further increase its position, to comply\nwith any prospective limit that exceeds the\nsize of the position owned or controlled, or\nto reduce any open position that exceeds the\nposition accountability level if the exchange\ndetermines that such action is necessary to\nmaintain an orderly market. Position\naccountability levels could adversely affect a\nFund's ability to establish and maintain\npositions in commodity futures contracts to\nwhich such levels apply, if the Fund were to\ntrade in such contracts, and a Fund's ability\nto achieve its investment objective. 41\nFutures contracts traded on markets outside\nthe U.S. are not generally subject to the same\nlevel of regulation by the CFTC or other U.S.\nregulatory entities as contracts traded in the\nU.S., including without limitation as to the\nexecution, delivery, and clearing of\ntransactions. U.S. regulators neither regulate\nthe activities of a foreign exchange, nor have\nthe power to compel enforcement of the rules\nof the foreign exchange or the laws of the\nforeign country in question. Margin and other\npayments made by a Fund may not be afforded\nthe same protections as are afforded those\npayments in the U.S., including in connection\nwith the insolvency of an executing or\nclearing broker or a clearinghouse or\nexchange. Certain foreign futures contracts\nmay be less liquid and more volatile than U.S.\ncontracts. Swaps Risk. A swap is a two-party\ncontract that generally obligates the parties\nto exchange payments based on a specified\nreference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can\ninvolve greater risks than direct investment\nin securities because swaps may be leveraged\nand are subject to counterparty risk ( e.g. ,\nthe risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and\npricing risk ( i.e. , swaps may be difficult\nto value). Swaps may also be considered\nilliquid. It may not be possible for a Fund to\nliquidate a swap position at an advantageous\ntime or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Emerging Markets Risk . Investments in\nemerging markets are generally subject to a\ngreater risk of loss than investments in\ndeveloped markets. This may be due to, among\nother things, the possibility of greater\nmarket volatility, lower trading volume and\nliquidity, greater risk of expropriation,\nnationalization, and social, political and\neconomic instability, greater reliance on a\nfew industries, international trade or revenue\nfrom particular commodities, less developed\naccounting, legal and regulatory systems,\nhigher levels of inflation, deflation or\ncurrency devaluation, greater risk of market\nshutdown, and more significant governmental\nlimitations on investment policy as compared\nto those typically found in a developed\nmarket. There may be limited legal rights and\nremedies for investors in companies domiciled\nin emerging markets. In addition, issuers\n(including governments) in emerging market\ncountries may have less financial stability\nthan in other countries. The securities of\nemerging market companies may trade less\nfrequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. Market disruptions or\nsubstantial market corrections may limit very\nsignificantly the liquidity of securities of\ncertain companies in a particular country or\ngeographic region, or of all companies in the\ncountry or region. A Fund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions in such securities at\nany time, or at a favorable price, in order to\nmeet the Fund's obligations. There is also the\npotential for unfavorable action such as\nembargo and acts of war. As a result, there\nwill tend to be an increased risk of price\nvolatility in investments in emerging market\ncountries, which may be magnified by currency\nfluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar.\nSettlement and asset custody practices for\ntransactions in emerging markets may differ\nfrom those in developed markets. Such\ndifferences may include possible delays in\nsettlement and certain settlement practices,\nsuch as delivery of securities prior to\nreceipt of payment, which increase the\nlikelihood of a \u201c failed settlement. \u201d Failed\nsettlements can result in losses. For these\nand other reasons, investments in emerging\nmarkets are often considered speculative.\nExtension Risk . During periods of rising\ninterest rates, the average life of certain\ntypes of securities may be extended because of\nslower-than-expected principal payments. This\nmay increase the period of time during which\nan investment earns a below-market interest\nrate, increase the security's duration and\nreduce the value of the security. Extension\nrisk may be heightened during periods of\nadverse economic conditions generally, as\npayment rates decline due to higher\nunemployment levels and other factors.\nFinancial Sector Risk . Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which may limit both\nthe amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition.\nIn addition, deterioration of the credit\nmarkets generally may cause an adverse impact\nin a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets.\nCertain events in the financial sector may\ncause an unusually high degree of volatility\nin the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services\ncompanies to incur large losses. Securities of\nfinancial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to\nraise capital (such as the issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or cease operations.\nCredit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses\nassociated with investment activities can 42\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse economic, business or\npolitical developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage\nfinance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to\nthe value of real estate. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk\n. The net asset value of Fund Shares will\ngenerally fluctuate with changes in the market\nvalue of a Fund's securities holdings. The\nmarket prices of Fund Shares will generally\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in a\nFund's net asset value and supply and demand\nof Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be\npredicted whether Fund Shares will trade\nbelow, at or above their net asset value.\nPrice differences may be due, in large part,\nto the fact that supply and demand forces at\nwork in the secondary trading market for Fund\nShares will be closely related to, but not\nidentical to, the same forces influencing the\nprices of the securities of an Index trading\nindividually or in the aggregate at any point\nin time. The market prices of Fund Shares may\ndeviate significantly from the net asset value\nof Fund Shares during periods of market\nvolatility. However, given that Fund Shares\ncan be created and redeemed in Creation Units\n(unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable discounts\nfrom, and sometimes at premiums to, their net\nasset value), the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts or premiums to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares should not be sustained over\nlong periods. While the creation/redemption\nfeature is designed to make it likely that\nFund Shares normally will trade close to a\nFund's net asset value, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions or market volatility\nmay result in trading prices that differ\nsignificantly from such Fund's net asset\nvalue. If an investor purchases Fund Shares at\na time when the market price is at a premium\nto the net asset value of Fund Shares or sells\nat a time when the market price is at a\ndiscount to the net asset value of Fund\nShares, then the investor may sustain losses.\nGeographic Focus Risk . The performance of a\nfund that is less diversified across countries\nor geographic regions will be closely tied to\nmarket, currency, economic, political,\nenvironmental, or regulatory conditions and\ndevelopments in the countries or regions in\nwhich the fund invests, and may be more\nvolatile than the performance of a more\ngeographically-diversified fund. Asia .\nCertain Asian economies have experienced high\ninflation, high unemployment, currency\ndevaluations and restrictions, and over-\nextension of credit. Many Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid growth and\nindustrialization, and there is no assurance\nthat this growth rate will be maintained.\nEconomic events in any one Asian country may\nhave a significant economic effect on the\nentire Asian region, as well as on major\ntrading partners outside Asia. Any adverse\nevent in the Asian markets may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on some or all of\nthe economies of the countries in which a Fund\ninvests. Many Asian countries are subject to\npolitical risk, including corruption and\nregional conflict with neighboring countries.\nIn addition, many Asian countries are subject\nto social and labor risks associated with\ndemands for improved political, economic and\nsocial conditions. These risks, among others,\nmay adversely affect the value of a Fund's\ninvestments. Europe . The Economic and\nMonetary Union of the EU requires compliance\nwith restrictions on inflation rates,\ndeficits, interest rates, debt levels and\nfiscal and monetary controls, each of which\nmay significantly affect every country in\nEurope. Decreasing imports or exports, changes\nin governmental or EU regulations on trade,\nchanges in the exchange rate of the euro (the\ncommon currency of certain EU countries), the\ndefault or threat of default by an EU member\ncountry on its sovereign debt, and/or an\neconomic recession in an EU member country may\nhave a significant adverse effect on the\neconomies of EU member countries and their\ntrading partners. The European financial\nmarkets have recently experienced volatility\nand adverse trends due to concerns about\neconomic downturns or rising government debt\nlevels in several European countries,\nincluding Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and\nSpain. These events have adversely affected\nthe exchange rate of the euro and may continue\nto significantly affect every country in\nEurope, including countries that do not use\nthe euro. Responses to the financial problems\nby European governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the desired results,\nmay result in social unrest and may limit\nfuture growth and economic recovery or have\nother unintended consequences. Further\ndefaults or restructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt could have\nadditional adverse effects on economies,\nfinancial markets and asset valuations around\nthe world. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. For example, on January 31, 2020, the\nUnited Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU\n(commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and,\nafter a transition period, left the EU single\nmarket and customs union under the terms of a\nnew trade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to\ntrading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain 43\nunresolved and subject to further negotiation\nand agreement. The full scope and nature of\nthe consequences of the exit are not at this\ntime known and are unlikely to be known for a\nsignificant period of time. It is also unknown\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Any exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist\nattacks and additional attacks may occur in\nthe future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty\nin financial markets and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. Japan. The growth of\nJapan's economy has historically lagged that\nof its Asian neighbors and other major\ndeveloped economies. The Japanese economy is\nheavily dependent on international trade and\nhas been adversely affected by trade tariffs,\nother protectionist measures, competition from\nemerging economies and the economic conditions\nof its trading partners. China has become an\nimportant trading partner with Japan, yet the\ncountries' political relationship has become\nstrained. Should political tension increase,\nit could adversely affect the economy,\nespecially the export sector, and destabilize\nthe region as a whole. Japan also remains\nheavily dependent on oil imports, and higher\ncommodity prices could therefore have a\nnegative impact on the economy. The Japanese\neconomy faces several other concerns,\nincluding a financial system with large levels\nof nonperforming loans, over-leveraged\ncorporate balance sheets, extensive cross-\nownership by major corporations, a changing\ncorporate governance structure, and large\ngovernment deficits. These issues may cause a\nslowdown of the Japanese economy. The Japanese\nyen has fluctuated widely at times and any\nincrease in its value may cause a decline in\nexports that could weaken the Japanese\neconomy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in\nthe currency markets to attempt to maintain or\nreduce the value of the yen. Japanese\nintervention in the currency markets could\ncause the value of the yen to fluctuate\nsharply and unpredictably and could cause\nlosses to investors. Japan has an aging\nworkforce and has experienced a significant\npopulation decline in recent years. Japan's\nlabor market appears to be undergoing\nfundamental structural changes, as a labor\nmarket traditionally accustomed to lifetime\nemployment adjusts to meet the need for\nincreased labor mobility, which may adversely\naffect Japan's economic competitiveness.\nNatural disasters, such as earthquakes,\nvolcanoes, typhoons or tsunamis, could occur\nin Japan or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Japanese economy and, in\nturn, a Fund. United Kingdom. The United\nKingdom has one of the largest economies in\nEurope, and the United States and other\nEuropean countries are substantial trading\npartners of the United Kingdom. As a result,\nthe British economy may be impacted by changes\nto the economic condition of the United States\nand other European countries. The British\neconomy relies heavily on the export of\nfinancial services to the United States and\nother European countries and, therefore, a\nprolonged slowdown in the financial services\nsector may have a negative impact on the\nBritish economy. Continued governmental\ninvolvement or control in certain sectors may\nstifle competition in certain sectors or cause\nadverse effects on economic growth. In the\npast, the United Kingdom has been a target of\nterrorism. Acts of terrorism in the United\nKingdom or against British interests abroad\nmay cause uncertainty in the British financial\nmarkets and adversely affect the performance\nof the issuers to which a Fund has exposure.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom\nformally withdrew from the EU (commonly\nreferred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and, after a\ntransition period, left the EU single market\nand customs union under the terms of a new\ntrade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to\ntrading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain unresolved\nand subject to further negotiation and\nagreement. There is still considerable\nuncertainty relating to the potential\nconsequences associated with the exit and\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Brexit may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for these\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of a Fund's\ninvestments. Income Risk. A Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling interest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of securities held by a Fund\nmay call or redeem the securities during\nperiods of falling interest rates, and the\nFund would likely be required to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower interest rates. If an\nobligation held by a Fund is prepaid, the Fund\nmay have to reinvest the prepayment in other\nobligations paying income at lower rates. A\nreduction in the income earned by a Fund may\nlimit the Fund's ability to achieve its\nobjective. 44 Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk . Each Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities. Each Fund will seek to provide\ninvestment results that correspond generally\nto the performance of the Index, regardless of\nthe current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising\nthe Index. This differs from an actively-\nmanaged fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. Each Fund\ngenerally will buy and will not sell a\nsecurity included in the Index as long as the\nsecurity is part of the Index regardless of\nany sudden or material decline in value or\nforeseeable material decline in value of the\nsecurity, even though the Adviser may make a\ndifferent investment decision for other\nactively managed accounts or portfolios that\nhold the security. As a result, a Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of\na portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Index (in absolute terms and\nby comparison with other indices) and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of a Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index\nin accordance with its methodology may occur\nfrom time to time and may not be identified\nand corrected by the Index Provider for a\nperiod of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on a Fund and its shareholders.\nTo the extent circumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, an Index may include, and the\ncorresponding Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that\ndo not align with the Index's objective and/or\ncriteria. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index (i.e., achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with the Index), a\nFund's return may not match the return of the\nIndex for a number of reasons. For example,\nthe return on the sample of securities\npurchased by a Fund (or the return on\nsecurities not included in the Index) may not\ncorrelate precisely with the return of the\nIndex. Each Fund incurs a number of operating\nexpenses not applicable to the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying and selling securities.\nIn addition, a Fund may not be fully invested\nat times, either as a result of cash flows\ninto or out of the Fund or reserves of cash\nheld by the Fund to meet redemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to track the Index return\nby investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between a\nFund's return and that of the Index. Changes\nin the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact a Fund's ability\nto match the return of the Index. The Adviser\nmay apply one or more \u201c screens \u201d or\ninvestment techniques to refine or limit the\nnumber or types of issuers included in the\nIndex in which a Fund may invest. Application\nof such screens or techniques may result in\ninvestment performance below that of the Index\nand may not produce results expected by the\nAdviser. Index tracking risk may be heightened\nduring times of increased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions. Pursuant to\neach Index methodology, a security may be\nremoved from an Index in the event that it\ndoes not comply with the eligibility\nrequirements of the Index. As a result, a Fund\nmay be forced to sell securities at\ninopportune times and/or unfavorable prices\ndue to these changes in the Index components.\nWhen there are changes made to the component\nsecurities of an Index and the corresponding\nFund in turn makes similar changes to its\nportfolio to attempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the Fund's portfolio and\nthe Index, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes\nwill be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unscheduled changes to an Index\nmay expose the corresponding Fund to\nadditional tracking error risk. A Fund may\nrecognize gains as a result of rebalancing or\nreconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in\nthe corresponding Index. A Fund also may be\nrequired to distribute any such gains to its\nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income\ntax consequences. 45 Inflation-Indexed\nSecurities Risk . The principal amount of an\ninflation-indexed security typically increases\nwith inflation and decreases with deflation,\nas measured by a specified index. It is\npossible that, in a period of declining\ninflation rates, a Fund could receive at\nmaturity less than the initial principal\namount of an inflation-indexed security.\nAlthough the holders of U.S. TIPS receive no\nless than the par value of the security at\nmaturity, if a Fund purchases U.S. TIPS in the\nsecondary market whose principal values have\npreviously been adjusted upward and there is a\nperiod of subsequent declining inflation\nrates, a Fund may receive at maturity less\nthan it invested. Depending on the changes in\ninflation rates during the period a Fund holds\nan inflation-indexed security, a Fund may earn\nless on the security than on a conventional\nbond. The principal amounts of inflation-\nindexed securities are typically only adjusted\nperiodically, and changes in the values of the\nsecurities may only approximately reflect\nchanges in inflation rates and may occur\nsubstantially after the changes in inflation\nrates in question occur. Interest Rate Risk .\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the\nsecurities held by a Fund will decline in\nvalue because of increases in market interest\nrates. Duration is a measure used to determine\nthe sensitivity of a security's price to\nchanges in interest rates. Debt securities\nwith longer durations tend to be more\nsensitive to changes in interest rates,\nusually making them more volatile than debt\nsecurities with shorter durations. For\nexample, the value of a security with a\nduration of five years would be expected to\ndecrease by 5% for every 1% increase in\ninterest rates. Falling interest rates also\ncreate the potential for a decline in a Fund's\nincome and yield. Interest-only and principal-\nonly securities are especially sensitive to\ninterest rate changes, which can affect not\nonly their prices but can also change the\nincome flows and repayment assumptions about\nthose investments. Variable and floating rate\nsecurities also generally increase or decrease\nin value in response to changes in interest\nrates, although generally to a lesser degree\nthan fixed-rate securities. A substantial\nincrease in interest rates may also have an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of a security,\nespecially those with longer durations.\nInterest rate changes can be sudden and\nunpredictable, and are influenced by a number\nof factors, including government policy,\nmonetary policy, inflation expectations,\nperceptions of risk, and supply and demand for\nbonds. Changes in government or central bank\npolicy, including changes in tax policy or\nchanges in a central bank's implementation of\nspecific policy goals, may have a substantial\nimpact on interest rates. This could lead to\nheightened levels of interest rate, volatility\nand liquidity risks for the fixed income\nmarkets generally and could have a substantial\nand immediate effect on the values of a Fund's\ninvestments. There can be no guarantee that\nany particular government or central bank\npolicy will be continued, discontinued or\nchanged, nor that any such policy will have\nthe desired effect on interest rates.\nLeveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions,\nreverse repurchase agreements, certain\nderivatives transactions, securities lending\ntransactions and other investment transactions\nsuch as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or\nforward commitment transactions may create\ninvestment leverage. If a Fund engages in\ntransactions that have a leveraging effect on\nthe Fund's investment portfolio, the value of\nthe Fund will be potentially more volatile and\nall other risks will tend to be compounded.\nThis is because leverage generally creates\ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than a Fund would otherwise have and\nso magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to\nbe a speculative investment practice and may\nresult in losses to a Fund. Certain\nderivatives have the potential for unlimited\nloss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause a\nFund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,\ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to\nmeet asset coverage requirements. Liquidity\nRisk . Liquidity risk is the risk that a Fund\nmay not be able to dispose of investments\nreadily at a favorable time or prices (or at\nall) or at prices approximating those at which\na Fund currently values them. For example,\ncertain investments may be subject to\nrestrictions on resale, may trade in the over-\nthe-counter market or in limited volume, or\nmay not have an active trading market.\nIlliquid investments may trade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more liquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide fluctuations in market\nvalue. It may be difficult for a Fund to value\nilliquid investments accurately. The market\nfor certain investments may become illiquid\nunder adverse market or economic conditions\nindependent of any specific adverse changes in\nthe conditions of a particular issuer. If the\nliquidity of a Fund's holdings deteriorates,\nit may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value\nof Fund Shares, and could result in the Fund\nShares being less liquid. Disposal of illiquid\ninvestments may entail registration expenses\nand other transaction costs that are higher\nthan those for liquid investments. A Fund may\nseek to borrow money to meet its obligations\n(including among other things redemption\nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of\nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing\nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund.\n46 Market Risk . Market prices of investments\nheld by a Fund will go up or down, sometimes\nrapidly or unpredictably. A Fund's investments\nare subject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile,\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\ninflation, changes in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in a\nFund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the\nFund invests do not perform well or are\nadversely affected by events. Further, legal,\npolitical, regulatory and tax changes also may\ncause fluctuations in markets and securities\nprices. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism,\nnatural disasters, the spread of infectious\nillness or other public health issues, or\nother events could have a significant impact\non a Fund and its investments. The COVID-19\nglobal pandemic has resulted in major\ndisruptions to economies and markets around\nthe world, including the United States.\nAlthough vaccines have been developed and\napproved for use by various governments, the\nduration of the pandemic and its effects\ncannot be predicted with certainty. COVID-19,\nand efforts to contain its spread, have\ncontributed to, and may continue to contribute\nto, market volatility, inflation, reduced\nliquidity of certain instruments, supply chain\ndisruptions, and systemic economic weakness,\nand trading in many instruments was and may\ncontinue to be disrupted as a result. In\nresponse, governments and central banks,\nincluding the Federal Reserve in the United\nStates, have taken extraordinary and\nunprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal economies and the financial markets.\nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective to mitigate the economic and\nmarket disruption, will not be known for some\ntime. The foregoing could impact a Fund and\nits investments and result in disruptions to\nthe services provided to a Fund by its service\nproviders. Non-Diversification Risk . Funds\nclassified as \u201c non-diversified \u201d may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent a Fund invests\nin a relatively small number of issuers, a\ndecline in the market value of a particular\nsecurity held by the Fund may affect its value\nmore than if it invested in a larger number of\nissuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more\nvolatile than the values of shares of more\ndiversified funds. A non-diversified Fund may\nbecome diversified for periods of time solely\nas a result of tracking its Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Non-U.S. Securities Risk .\nInvestments in securities of non-U.S. issuers\nentail risks not typically associated with\ninvesting in securities of U.S. issuers.\nSimilar risks may apply to securities traded\non a U.S. securities exchange that are issued\nby entities with significant exposure to\nnon-U.S. countries. In certain countries,\nlegal remedies available to investors may be\nmore limited than those available with regard\nto U.S. investments. Because non-U.S.\nsecurities are typically denominated and\ntraded in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar, the value of the Fund's assets, to the\nextent they are non-U.S. dollar denominated,\nmay be affected favorably or unfavorably by\ncurrency exchange rates, exchange control\nregulations, and delays, restrictions or\nprohibitions on the repatriation of non-U.S.\ncurrencies. To the extent underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are closed when the exchange on\nwhich the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of\nan underlying security and the last quoted\nprice for the underlying security on the\nclosed foreign market. These deviations could\nresult in the Fund experiencing premiums or\ndiscounts greater than those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic securities. Income and\ngains with respect to investments in certain\ncountries may be subject to withholding and\nother taxes. There may be less information\npublicly available about a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S. entity, and many non-U.S.\nentities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, and financial reporting standards,\nregulatory framework and practices comparable\nto those in the United States. The securities\nof some non-U.S. entities are less liquid and\nat times more volatile than securities of\ncomparable U.S. entities, and could become\nsubject to sanctions or embargoes that\nadversely affect a Fund's investment. Non-U.S.\ntransaction costs, such as brokerage\ncommissions and custody costs may be higher\nthan in the U.S. In addition, there may be a\npossibility of nationalization or\nexpropriation of assets, imposition of\ncurrency exchange controls, confiscatory\ntaxation, and diplomatic developments that\ncould adversely affect the values of a Fund's\ninvestments in issuers in certain non-U.S.\ncountries. Investments in securities of\nnon-U.S. issuers also are subject to foreign\npolitical and economic risk not associated\nwith U.S. investments, meaning that political\nevents (civil unrest, national elections,\nchanges in political conditions and foreign\nrelations, imposition of exchange controls and\nrepatriation restrictions), social and\neconomic events (labor strikes, rising\ninflation) and natural disasters occurring in\na country where a Fund invests could cause the\nFund's investments to experience gains or\nlosses. 47 Reinvestment Risk. Income from a\nFund's portfolio may decline when the Fund\ninvests the proceeds from investment income,\nsales of portfolio securities or matured,\ntraded or called debt obligations. For\ninstance, during periods of declining interest\nrates, an issuer of debt obligations may\nexercise an option to redeem securities prior\nto maturity, forcing a Fund to reinvest the\nproceeds in lower-yielding securities. A\ndecline in income received by a Fund from its\ninvestments is likely to have a negative\neffect on the yield and total return of the\nFund Shares. Restricted Securities Risk . A\nFund may hold securities that have not been\nregistered for sale to the public under the\nU.S. federal securities laws pursuant to an\nexemption from registration. These securities\nmay be less liquid than securities registered\nfor sale to the general public. The liquidity\nof a restricted security may be affected by a\nnumber of factors, including, among others:\n(i) the creditworthiness of the issuer; (ii)\nthe frequency of trades and quotes for the\nsecurity; (iii) the number of dealers willing\nto purchase or sell the security and the\nnumber of other potential purchasers; (iv)\ndealer undertakings to make a market in the\nsecurity; (v) the nature of any legal\nrestrictions governing trading in the\nsecurity; and (vi) the nature of the security\nand the nature of marketplace trades. There\ncan be no assurance that a liquid trading\nmarket will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Also,\nrestricted securities may be difficult to\nvalue because market quotations may not be\nreadily available, and the securities may have\nsignificant volatility. Settlement Risk .\nMarkets in different countries have different\nclearance and settlement procedures and in\ncertain markets there have been times when\nsettlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of transactions. Delays in\nsettlement may increase credit risk to a Fund,\nlimit the ability of a Fund to reinvest the\nproceeds of a sale of securities, hinder the\nability of a Fund to lend its portfolio\nsecurities, and potentially subject a Fund to\npenalties for its failure to deliver to on-\npurchasers of securities whose delivery to a\nFund was delayed. Delays in the settlement of\nsecurities purchased by a Fund may limit the\nability of a Fund to sell those securities at\ntimes and prices it considers desirable, and\nmay subject a Fund to losses and costs due to\nits own inability to settle with subsequent\npurchasers of the securities from it. A Fund\nmay be required to borrow monies it had\notherwise expected to receive in connection\nwith the settlement of securities sold by it,\nin order to meet its obligations to others.\nLimits on the ability of a Fund to purchase or\nsell securities due to settlement delays could\nincrease any variance between a Fund's\nperformance and that of its benchmark index.\nSovereign Debt Obligations Risk . Investments\nin debt securities issued by governments or by\ngovernment agencies and instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that the governmental\nentities responsible for repayment may be\nunable or unwilling to pay interest and repay\nprincipal when due. A governmental entity's\nwillingness or ability to pay interest and\nrepay principal in a timely manner may be\naffected by a variety of factors, including\nits cash flow, the size of its reserves, its\naccess to foreign exchange, the relative size\nof its debt service burden to its economy as a\nwhole, and political constraints. A\ngovernmental entity may default on its\nobligations or may require renegotiation or\nreschedule of debt payments. Any restructuring\nof a sovereign debt obligation held by a Fund\nwill likely have a significant adverse effect\non the value of the obligation. In the event\nof default of sovereign debt, the Fund may be\nunable to pursue legal action against the\nsovereign issuer or to realize on collateral\nsecuring the debt. The sovereign debt of\ncertain non-U.S. governments, including their\nsub-divisions and instrumentalities, is rated\nbelow investment-grade. Sovereign debt risk\nmay be greater for debt securities issued or\nguaranteed by emerging and/or frontier\ncountries. Unconstrained Sector Risk . A Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets\nwithin one or more economic sectors or\nindustries, which may change from time to\ntime. When a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector,\nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nValuation Risk . Some portfolio holdings,\npotentially a large portion of a Fund's\ninvestment portfolio, may be valued on the\nbasis of factors other than market quotations.\nThis may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a\nportfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201c fair\nvalued \u201d securities, may be subject to greater\n48 fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were\nused. Technological issues or other service\ndisruption issues involving third-party\nservice providers may cause a Fund to value\nits investments incorrectly. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that a Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the\nvalue established for it at any time, and it\nis possible that a Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established\nby a Fund at that time. Non-Principal Risks\nEach risk discussed below is a non-principal\nrisk of a Fund to the extent it is not\nidentified as a principal risk for such Fund\nin the preceding \u201c ADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION\n- PRINCIPAL RISKS \u201d section. Authorized\nParticipants, Market Makers and Liquidity\nProviders Concentration Risk. A Fund has a\nlimited number of financial institutions that\nmay act as Authorized Participants ( \u201c APs \u201d\n), which are responsible for the creation and\nredemption activity for a Fund. In addition,\nthere may be a limited number of market makers\nand/or liquidity providers in the marketplace.\nTo the extent either of the following events\noccur, Fund Shares may trade at a material\ndiscount to NAV and possibly face delisting:\n(i) APs exit the business or otherwise become\nunable to process creation and/or redemption\norders and no other APs step forward to\nperform these services, or (ii) market makers\nand/or liquidity providers exit the business\nor significantly reduce their business\nactivities and no other entities step forward\nto perform their functions. Cash Transaction\nRisk . To the extent a Fund sells portfolio\nsecurities to meet some or all of a redemption\nrequest with cash, the Fund may incur taxable\ngains or losses that it might not have\nincurred had it made redemptions entirely in-\nkind. As a result, a Fund may pay out higher\nannual capital gain distributions than if the\nin-kind redemption process was used.\nConcentration Risk. A Fund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries, but only to the extent that the\nFund's underlying Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries.\nWhen a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector,\nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nConflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a\nFund will be subject to a number of actual or\npotential conflicts of interest. For example,\nthe Adviser or its affiliates may provide\nservices to a Fund, such as securities lending\nagency services, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer\nagency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for\nwhich the Fund would compensate the Adviser\nand/or such affiliates. The Funds may invest\nin other pooled investment vehicles sponsored,\nmanaged, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the\nAdviser or its affiliates, or the terms on\nwhich it enters into transactions with the\nAdviser or its affiliates will be the most\nfavorable available in the market generally or\nas favorable as the rates the Adviser or its\naffiliates make available to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of a\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements. The Adviser and its\naffiliates serve as investment adviser to\nother clients and may make investment\ndecisions that may be different from those\nthat will be made by the Adviser on behalf of\nthe Funds. For example, the Adviser may\nprovide asset allocation advice to some\nclients that may include a recommendation to\ninvest in or redeem from particular issuers\nwhile not providing that same recommendation\nto all clients invested in the same or similar\nissuers. The Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to\npurchase (or sell) investments for a Fund and\nto sell (or purchase) the same investment for\naccounts, funds, or structured products for\nwhich it serves as asset manager, or for other\nclients or affiliates. The Adviser and its\naffiliates may invest for clients in various\nsecurities that are senior, pari passu or\njunior to, or have interests different from or\nadverse to, the securities that are owned by a\nFund. The Adviser or its affiliates, in\nconnection with its other business activities,\nmay acquire material nonpublic confidential\ninformation that may restrict the Adviser from\npurchasing securities or selling securities\nfor itself or its clients (including the\nFunds) or otherwise using such information for\nthe benefit of its clients or itself. The\nforegoing does not purport to be a\ncomprehensive list or complete explanation of\nall potential conflicts of interests which may\naffect a Fund. A Fund may encounter\ncircumstances, or enter into transactions, in\nwhich conflicts of interest that are not\nlisted or discussed above may arise. 49 Costs\nof Buying and Selling Shares . Investors\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket will pay brokerage commissions or other\ncharges imposed by brokers, as determined by\nthat broker. Brokerage commissions are often a\nfixed amount and may be a significant\nproportional cost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell relatively small amounts of Fund\nShares. In addition, secondary market\ninvestors will also incur the cost of the\ndifference between the price that an investor\nis willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201c bid \u201d\nprice) and the price at which an investor is\nwilling to sell Fund Shares (the \u201c ask \u201d\nprice). This difference in bid and ask prices\nis often referred to as the \u201c spread \u201d or \u201c\nbid/ask spread. \u201d The bid/ask spread varies\nover time for Fund Shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and is generally\nlower if Fund Shares have more trading volume\nand market liquidity and higher if Fund Shares\nhave little trading volume and market\nliquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask\nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,\nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may\nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making\nsmall investments. Cybersecurity Risk . With\nthe increased use of technologies such as the\nInternet and the dependence on computer\nsystems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, funds (such as the Funds) and their\nservice providers (including the Adviser) may\nbe prone to operational and information\nsecurity risks resulting from cyber-attacks\nand/or technological malfunctions. In general,\ncyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects.\nCyber-attacks include, among others, stealing\nor corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate users from\naccessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information\nwithout authorization, and causing operational\ndisruption. Successful cyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns of, a Fund, the\nAdviser, or a custodian, transfer agent, or\nother affiliated or third-party service\nprovider may adversely affect a Fund or its\nshareholders. For instance, cyber-attacks or\ntechnical malfunctions may interfere with the\nprocessing of shareholder or other\ntransactions, affect a Fund's ability to\ncalculate its NAV, cause the release of\nprivate shareholder information or\nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject a Fund\nto regulatory fines, penalties or financial\nlosses, reimbursement or other compensation\ncosts, and additional compliance costs. Cyber-\nattacks or technical malfunctions may render\nrecords of Fund assets and transactions,\nshareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and\nother data integral to the functioning of a\nFund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete.\nA Fund may also incur substantial costs for\ncybersecurity risk management in order to\nprevent cyber incidents in the future. A Fund\nand its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. While the Adviser has\nestablished business continuity plans and\nsystems designed to minimize the risk of\ncyber-attacks through the use of technology,\nprocesses and controls, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, given the evolving\nnature of this threat. Each Fund relies on\nthird-party service providers for many of its\nday-to-day operations, and will be subject to\nthe risk that the protections and protocols\nimplemented by those service providers will be\nineffective to protect the Fund from cyber-\nattack. The Adviser does not control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems put in place\nby third-party service providers, and such\nthird-party service providers may have limited\nindemnification obligations to the Adviser or\nthe Funds. Similar types of cybersecurity\nrisks or technical malfunctions also are\npresent for issuers of securities in which\neach Fund invests, which could result in\nmaterial adverse consequences for such\nissuers, and may cause a Fund's investment in\nsuch securities to lose value. Index\nConstruction Risk . A security included in an\nIndex may not exhibit the characteristic or\nprovide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently a Fund's holdings\nmay not exhibit returns consistent with that\ncharacteristic or exposure. Index Licensing\nRisk . It is possible that the license under\nwhich the Adviser or a Fund is permitted to\nreplicate or otherwise use an Index will be\nterminated or may be disputed, impaired or\ncease to remain in effect. In such a case, the\nAdviser may be required to replace the\nrelevant Index with another index which it\nconsiders to be appropriate in light of the\ninvestment strategy of a Fund. The use of any\nsuch substitute index may have an adverse\nimpact on a Fund's performance. In the event\nthat the Adviser is unable to identify a\nsuitable replacement for the relevant Index,\nit may determine to terminate a Fund. Money\nMarket Risk . An investment in a money market\nfund is not a deposit of any bank and is not\ninsured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other\ngovernment agency. Certain money market funds\nseek to preserve the value of their shares at\n$1.00 per share, although there can be no\nassurance that they will do so, and it is\npossible to lose money by investing in such a\nmoney market fund. A major or unexpected\nchange in interest rates or a decline in the\ncredit quality of an issuer or entity\nproviding credit support, an inactive trading\nmarket for money market instruments, or\nadverse market, economic, industry, political,\nregulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions\ncould cause the share 50 price of such a money\nmarket fund to fall below $1.00. It is\npossible that such a money market fund will\nissue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at\ntimes when the fair value of the money market\nfund's portfolio per share is more or less\nthan $1.00. None of State Street Corporation,\nState Street, State Street Global Advisors ( \u201c\nSSGA \u201d ), SSGA FM or their affiliates (the \u201c\nState Street Entities \u201d ) guarantee the value\nof an investment in a money market fund at\n$1.00 per share. Investors should have no\nexpectation of capital support to a money\nmarket fund from State Street Entities. Other\nmoney market funds price and transact at a \u201c\nfloating \u201d NAV that will fluctuate along with\nchanges in the market-based value of fund\nassets. Shares sold utilizing a floating NAV\nmay be worth more or less than their original\npurchase price. Recent changes in the\nregulation of money market funds may affect\nthe operations and structures of money market\nfunds. A money market fund may be permitted or\nrequired to impose redemption fees or to\nimpose limitations on redemptions during\nperiods of high illiquidity in the markets for\nthe investments held by it. Portfolio Turnover\nRisk . A Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to a Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of securities\nand reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover\nhave the effect of reducing a Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities\nby the Fund may result in the realization of\ntaxable capital gains, including short-term\ncapital gains. A Fund may engage in\nsignificant trading of its portfolio\nsecurities in connection with Index\nrebalancing. Frequent or significant trading\nmay cause a Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does\nnot engage in frequent or significant trading.\nSecurities Lending Risk. Each Fund may lend\nportfolio securities in an amount not to\nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For\nthese purposes, net assets shall exclude the\nvalue of all assets received as collateral for\nthe loan. Such loans may be terminated at any\ntime. Any such loans must be continuously\nsecured by collateral maintained on a current\nbasis in an amount at least equal to the\nmarket value of the securities loaned by a\nFund, marked to market each trading day. A\nFund will receive the amount of all dividends,\ninterest and other distributions on the loaned\nsecurities, however, the borrower has the\nright to vote the loaned securities. A Fund\nwill call loans to vote proxies if a material\nissue affecting the investment is to be voted\nupon. Efforts to recall such securities\npromptly may be unsuccessful, especially for\nforeign securities or thinly traded\nsecurities. Securities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. Should the borrower of the securities\nfail financially, a Fund may experience delays\nin recovering the securities or exercising its\nrights in the collateral. Loans are made only\nto borrowers that are deemed by the securities\nlending agent to be of good financial\nstanding. In a loan transaction, a Fund will\nalso bear the risk of any decline in value of\nsecurities provided as collateral or acquired\nwith cash collateral. Each Fund will attempt\nto minimize this risk by limiting the\ninvestment of cash collateral to high quality\ninstruments of short maturity either directly\non behalf of the lending Fund or through one\nor more joint accounts or funds, which may\ninclude those managed by the Adviser. To the\nextent the collateral provided or investments\nmade with cash collateral differ from\nsecurities included in an Index, such\ncollateral or investments may have a greater\nrisk of loss than the securities included in\nthe Index. In addition, a Fund will be subject\nto the risk that any income generated by\nlending its securities or reinvesting cash\ncollateral is lower than any fees the Fund has\nagreed to pay a borrower. The Adviser will\ntake into account the tax impact to\nshareholders of substitute payments for\ndividends when overseeing a Fund's securities\nlending activity. Trading Issues . Although\nFund Shares are listed for trading on the\nExchange and may be listed or traded on U.S.\nand non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the\nExchange, there can be no assurance that an\nactive trading market for such Fund Shares\nwill develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund\nShares on the Exchange may be halted due to\nmarket conditions or for reasons that, in the\nview of the Exchange, make trading in Fund\nShares inadvisable. In addition, trading in\nFund Shares on the Exchange is subject to\ntrading halts caused by extraordinary market\nvolatility pursuant to Exchange \u201c circuit\nbreaker \u201d rules. Similar to the shares of\noperating companies listed on a stock\nexchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and\nare therefore subject to the risk of increased\nvolatility in the trading price of the Fund's\nshares. While each Fund expects that the\nability of Authorized Participants to create\nand redeem Fund Shares at net asset value\nshould be effective in reducing any such\nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such\nshort sales. There can be no assurance that\nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of a Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that\nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at\nall, on any stock exchange. 51\n\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves\nas the investment adviser to each Fund and,\nsubject to the oversight of the Board, is\nresponsible for the investment management of\neach Fund.

The\nAdviser has contractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fee and/or reimburse\nexpenses in an amount equal to any acquired\nfund fees and expenses (excluding holdings in\nacquired funds for cash management purposes,\nif any) for each Fund until April 30, 2024.\nThis waiver and/or reimbursement does not\nprovide for the recoupment by the Adviser of\nany amounts waived or reimbursed. This waiver\nand/or reimbursement may not be terminated\nprior to April 30, 2024 except with the\napproval of the Board. The Adviser pays all\nexpenses of each Fund other than the\nmanagement fee, brokerage expenses, taxes,\ninterest, fees and expenses of the Independent\nTrustees (including any Trustee's counsel\nfees), litigation expenses, acquired fund fees\nand expenses and other extraordinary expenses.\nParticipating Affiliates. The Adviser has\nentered into personnel-sharing arrangements\nwith each of SSGA LTD and SSGA Singapore, each\nan affiliate of the Adviser. SSGA LTD is an\nindirect wholly-owned subsidiary of State\nStreet Global Advisors, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA, Inc. \u201d\n) and SSGA Singapore is a direct wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of SSGA, Inc. SSGA, Inc. is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation. Pursuant to the personnel-sharing\narrangements, certain employees of SSGA LTD\nand SSGA Singapore, as \u201c participating\naffiliates, \u201d serve as \u201c associated persons \u201d\nof the Adviser, and, in this capacity, are\nsubject to the oversight of the Adviser and\nits Chief Compliance Officer. These associated\npersons may, on behalf of the Adviser, provide\ndiscretionary investment management services\n(including portfolio management and trading\nservices), research and related services to\nthe applicable Fund(s) in accordance with the\ninvestment objectives, policies and\nlimitations set forth in the prospectus and\nSAI. SSGA LTD provides such services to the\nSPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF\nand the SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate\nBond ETF. SSGA Singapore provides such\nservices to the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging\nMarkets Local Bond ETF. Unlike the Adviser,\nneither SSGA LTD nor SSGA Singapore is\nregistered as an investment adviser with the\nSEC. Each personnel-sharing arrangement is\nbased on no-action letters of the staff of the\nSEC that permit SEC-registered investment\nadvisers to rely on and use the resources of\nadvisory affiliates, subject to certain\nconditions. Prior to March 31, 2023, SSGA LTD\nwas a registered investment adviser with the\nSEC, and provided investment sub-advisory\nservices to the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging\nMarkets Local Bond ETF and SPDR Bloomberg\nInternational Corporate Bond ETF.

A discussion\nregarding the Board's consideration of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement is provided in\nthe Funds' Semi-Annual Report to Shareholders\nfor the period ended June 30, 2022.\n\n52\n\nSSGA FM, as the investment adviser for the\nFunds, may hire one or more sub-advisers to\noversee the day-to-day investment activities\nof the Funds. The sub-advisers are subject to\noversight by the Adviser. The Adviser and SPDR\nSeries Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) have received an\nexemptive order from the SEC that permits the\nAdviser, with the approval of the Board,\nincluding a majority of the Independent\nTrustees, of the Trust, to retain and amend\nexisting sub-advisory agreements with\nunaffiliated investment sub-advisers for a\nFund without submitting the sub-advisory\nagreement to a vote of the Fund's\nshareholders. The Trust will notify\nshareholders in the event of any change in the\nidentity of such sub-adviser or sub-advisers.\nThe Adviser has ultimate responsibility for\nthe investment performance of the Funds due to\nits responsibility to oversee each sub-adviser\nand recommend their hiring, termination and\nreplacement. The Adviser is not required to\ndisclose fees paid to any unaffiliated sub-\nadviser retained pursuant to the order.\nApproval by a Fund's shareholders is required\nbefore any authority granted under the\nexemptive order may be exercised. Portfolio\nManagers.\nThe Adviser manages the Funds using a team of\ninvestment professionals. The team approach is\nused to create an environment that encourages\nthe flow of investment ideas. The portfolio\nmanagers within each team work together in a\ncohesive manner to develop and enhance\ntechniques that drive the investment process\nfor the respective investment strategy. This\napproach requires portfolio managers to share\na variety of responsibilities, including\ninvestment strategy and analysis, while\nretaining responsibility for the\nimplementation of the strategy within any\nparticular portfolio. The approach also\nenables the team to draw upon the resources of\nother groups within SSGA. Each portfolio\nmanagement team is overseen by the SSGA\nInvestment Committee. The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of each Fund are:\n                                              \n  Portfolio Managers    Fund                  \n  Abhishek Kumar,                             \n  Robert Golcher,       SPDR Bloomberg        \n  CatherineSmith,       Emerging Markets      \n  Kheng Siang Ng and    Local Bond ETF        \n  Imran                                       \n  Khan                                        \n  Richard               SPDR Bloomberg        \n  Darby-Dowman, Paul    International         \n  Brown                 Corporate Bond ETF    \n  andPeter Spano                              \n                        SPDR Bloomberg        \n                        International         \n                        Treasury Bond ETF,    \n  James Kramer, Joanna  SPDR Bloomberg Short  \n  Madden and            Term International    \n  CynthiaMoy            Treasury Bond ETF,    \n                        SPDR FTSE             \n                        InternationalGovern\u2026  \n                        Inflation-Protected   \n                        Bond ETF              \n                                              \nPaul Brown is a Vice President and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Team at SSGA LTD, having joined the\ncompany in 2013.

The secondary markets\nare closed on weekends and also are generally\nclosed on the following holidays: New Year's\nDay, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Juneteenth National Independence\nDay, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving\nDay and Christmas Day. The Exchange may close\nearly on the business day before certain\nholidays and on the day after Thanksgiving\nDay. Exchange holiday schedules are subject to\nchange without notice. If you buy or sell Fund\nShares in the secondary market, you will pay\nthe secondary market price for Fund Shares. In\naddition, you may incur customary brokerage\ncommissions and charges and may pay some or\nall of the spread between the bid and the\noffered price in the secondary market on each\nleg of a round trip (purchase and sale)\ntransaction. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nwill fluctuate continuously throughout trading\nhours based on market supply and demand rather\nthan the relevant Fund's net asset value,\nwhich is calculated for each Fund once daily\nas of the close of the regular trading session\non the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern\ntime) on each day that such exchange is open.\nFund Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nprices that may be above ( i.e ., at a\npremium) or below ( i.e ., at a discount), to\nvarying degrees, the calculated net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares. The trading prices of\nFund Shares may deviate significantly from the\nrelevant Fund's net asset value during periods\nof market volatility. Given, however, that\nFund Shares can be issued and redeemed daily\nin Creation Units, the Adviser believes that\nlarge discounts and premiums to net asset\nvalue should not be sustained over long\nperiods. The Exchange will disseminate, every\nfifteen seconds during the regular trading\nday, an indicative optimized portfolio value (\n\u201c IOPV \u201d ) relating to each Fund. The IOPV\ncalculations are estimates of the value of\neach Fund's net asset value per Fund Share.\nPremiums and discounts between the IOPV and\nthe market price may occur. This should not be\nviewed as a \u201c real-time \u201d update of the net\nasset value per Fund Share. The IOPV is based\non the current market value of the published\nbasket of portfolio securities and/or cash\nrequired to be deposited in exchange for a\nCreation Unit and does not necessarily reflect\nthe precise composition of a Fund's actual\nportfolio at a particular point in time.\nMoreover, the IOPV is generally determined by\nusing current market quotations and/or price\nquotations obtained from broker-dealers and\nother market intermediaries and valuations\nbased on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the\nNAV, which (i) is computed only once a day,\n(ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be\nsubject, in accordance with the requirements\nof the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at\ndifferent prices than those used in the\ncalculations of the IOPV. The IOPV price is\nbased on quotes and closing prices from the\nsecurities' local market converted into U.S.\ndollars at the current currency rates and may\nnot reflect events that occur subsequent to\nthe local market's close. Therefore, the IOPV\nmay not reflect the best possible valuation of\na Fund's current portfolio. Neither the Funds\nnor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are\ninvolved in, or responsible for, the\ncalculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and\nmake no warranty as to their accuracy. The\nFunds do not impose any restrictions on the\nfrequency of purchases and redemptions;\nhowever, the Funds reserve the right to reject\nor limit purchases at any time as described in\nthe SAI. When considering that no restriction\nor policy was necessary, the Board evaluated\nthe risks posed by market timing activities,\nsuch as whether frequent purchases and\nredemptions would interfere with the efficient\nimplementation of a Fund's investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause a Fund\nto experience increased transaction costs. The\nBoard considered that, unlike traditional\nmutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and\nredeemed only in large quantities of shares\nknown as Creation Units, available only from a\nFund directly, and that most trading in a Fund\noccurs on the Exchange at prevailing market\nprices and does not involve the Fund directly.\nGiven this structure, the Board determined\nthat it is unlikely that (a) market timing\nwould be attempted by a Fund's shareholders or\n(b) any attempts to market time a Fund by\nshareholders would result in negative impact\nto the Fund or its shareholders. Distributions\nDividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund\nshareholder, you are entitled to your share of\nthe applicable Fund's income and net realized\ngains on its investments. Each Fund pays out\nsubstantially all of its net earnings to its\nshareholders as \u201c distributions. \u201d 57 Each\nFund may earn interest from debt securities\nand, if participating, securities lending\nincome. Each Fund will generally realize\nshort-term capital gains or losses whenever it\nsells or exchanges assets held for one year or\nless. Net short-term capital gains will\ngenerally be treated as ordinary income when\ndistributed to shareholders. Each Fund will\ngenerally realize long-term capital gains or\nlosses whenever it sells or exchanges assets\nheld for more than one year. Net capital gains\n(the excess of a Fund's net long-term capital\ngains over its net short-term capital losses)\nare distributed to shareholders as \u201c capital\ngain distributions. \u201d Income dividend\ndistributions, if any, are generally\ndistributed to shareholders monthly, but may\nvary significantly from period to period. Net\ncapital gains for each Fund are distributed at\nleast annually. Dividends may be declared and\npaid more frequently or at any other time to\nimprove Index tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c Code \u201d\n). A portion of each distribution may result\nin a return of capital. You will be notified\nregarding the portion of the distribution\nwhich represents a return of capital.\nDistributions in cash may be reinvested\nautomatically in additional whole Fund Shares\nonly if the broker through whom you purchased\nFund Shares makes such option available.\nDistributions which are reinvested will\nnevertheless be taxable to the same extent as\nif such distributions had not been reinvested.\nPortfolio Holdings Disclosure The Funds'\nportfolio holdings disclosure policy is\ndescribed in the SAI. In addition, the\nidentities and quantities of the securities\nheld by each Fund are disclosed on the Funds'\nwebsite. Additional Tax Information The\nfollowing discussion is a summary of some\nimportant U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in a Fund. Your investment in a\nFund may have other tax implications. Please\nconsult your tax advisor about federal, state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax laws applicable to\nyou. Investors, including non-U.S. investors,\nmay wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. Taxes On Distributions.\nIn general, your distributions are subject to\nfederal income tax when they are paid, whether\nyou take them in cash or reinvest them in a\nFund. The income dividends and short-term\ncapital gains distributions you receive from\nthe Funds will generally be taxed as ordinary\nincome. Any distributions of a Fund's net\ncapital gains are taxable as long-term capital\ngain regardless of how long you have owned\nFund Shares. Long-term capital gains are\ngenerally taxed to noncorporate shareholders\nat reduced rates. Distributions in excess of a\nFund's current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits are treated as a tax-free return of\ncapital to the extent of your basis in the\nFund's shares, and, in general, as capital\ngain thereafter. Since the Funds primarily\nhold investments that do not pay dividends, it\nis not expected that a substantial portion (if\nany) of the dividends paid by a Fund will\nqualify for either the dividends-received\ndeduction for corporations or the favorable\nincome tax rates available to individuals on\nqualified dividend income. U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding specified thresholds are\nsubject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on\nall or a portion of their \u201c net investment\nincome, \u201d which includes taxable interest,\ndividends and certain capital gains (generally\nincluding capital gain distributions and\ncapital gains realized upon the sale of Fund\nShares). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or\na portion of the undistributed net investment\nincome of certain shareholders that are\nestates and trusts. Certain tax-exempt\neducational institutions will be subject to a\n1.4% tax on net investment income. For these\npurposes, certain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. Distributions paid in\nJanuary, but declared by a Fund in October,\nNovember or December of the previous year,\npayable to shareholders of record in such a\nmonth, may be taxable to you in the calendar\nyear in which they were declared. The Funds\nwill inform you of the amount of your ordinary\nincome dividends and capital gain\ndistributions shortly after the close of each\ncalendar year. A distribution will reduce a\nFund's net asset value per Fund Share and may\nbe taxable to you as ordinary income or\ncapital gain even though, from an investment\nstandpoint, the distribution may constitute a\nreturn of capital. 58 Original Issue Discount\n. Investments by a Fund in zero coupon or\nother discount securities will result in\nincome to the Fund equal to a portion of the\nexcess face value of the securities over their\nissue price (the \u201c original issue discount \u201d\nor \u201c OID \u201d ) each year that the securities are\nheld, even though the Fund may receive no cash\ninterest payments or may receive cash interest\npayments that are less than the income\nrecognized for tax purposes. In other\ncircumstances, whether pursuant to the terms\nof a security or as a result of other factors\noutside the control of a Fund, a Fund may\nrecognize income without receiving a\ncommensurate amount of cash. A Fund's share of\nsuch income is included in determining the\namount that the Fund must distribute to\nmaintain its eligibility for treatment as a\nregulated investment company and to avoid the\npayment of federal tax, including the\nnondeductible 4% excise tax. Because any\nincome required to be recognized as a result\nof the OID and/or market discount rules\n(discussed below) may not be matched by a\ncorresponding cash payment, the Fund may be\nrequired to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to be able to make distributions to\nits shareholders in order to qualify for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand eliminate taxes at the Fund level.\nInflation-Indexed Bonds. Special rules apply\nif a Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds.\nGenerally, all stated interest on inflation-\nindexed bonds is taken into income by a Fund\nunder its regular method of accounting for\ninterest income. The amount of any positive\ninflation adjustment for a taxable year, which\nresults from an increase in the inflation-\nadjusted principal amount of the bond, is\ntreated as OID. The amount of a Fund's OID in\na taxable year with respect to a bond will\nincrease the Fund's taxable income for such\nyear without a corresponding receipt of cash\nuntil the bond matures. As a result, a Fund\nmay need to use other sources of cash to\nsatisfy its distribution requirements for such\nyear. The amount of any negative inflation\nadjustments, which result from a decrease in\nthe inflation-adjusted principal amount of the\nbond, first reduces the amount of interest\n(including stated interest, OID, and market\ndiscount, if any) otherwise includible in a\nFund's income with respect to the bond for the\ntaxable year; any remaining negative\nadjustments will be either treated as ordinary\nloss or, in certain circumstances, carried\nforward to reduce the amount of interest\nincome taken into account with respect to the\nbond in future taxable years. Market Discount.\nAny market discount recognized on a market\ndiscount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A\nmarket discount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or below adjusted issue price if the\nbond was issued with original issue discount.\nAbsent an election by a Fund to include the\nmarket discount in income as it accrues, the\ngain on the Fund's disposition of such an\nobligation will be treated as ordinary income\nrather than capital gain to the extent of the\naccrued market discount. Where the income\nrequired to be recognized as a result of the\nmarket discount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash receipt by the Fund, the\nFund may be required to borrow money or\ndispose of securities to enable the Fund to\nmake distributions to its shareholders in\norder to qualify for treatment as a regulated\ninvestment company and eliminate taxes at the\nFund level, potentially resulting in\nadditional taxable gain or loss to the Fund.\nDerivatives and Other Complex Securities. A\nFund may invest in complex securities. These\ninvestments may be subject to numerous special\nand complex rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund\nare treated as ordinary income or capital\ngain, accelerate the recognition of income to\na Fund and/or defer a Fund's ability to\nrecognize losses. In turn, these rules may\naffect the amount, timing or character of the\nincome distributed to you by a Fund. You\nshould consult your personal tax advisor\nregarding the application of these rules.\nForeign Currency Transactions. A Fund's\ntransactions in foreign currencies, foreign\ncurrency denominated debt obligations and\ncertain foreign currency options, futures\ncontracts and forward contracts (and similar\ninstruments) may give rise to ordinary income\nor loss to the extent such income or loss\nresults from fluctuations in the value of the\nforeign currency concerned. Foreign Income\nTaxes. Investment income received by a Fund\nfrom sources within foreign countries may be\nsubject to foreign income taxes withheld at\nthe source. The United States has entered into\ntax treaties with many foreign countries which\nmay entitle a Fund to a reduced rate of such\ntaxes or exemption from taxes on such income.\nIt is impossible to determine the effective\nrate of foreign tax for a Fund in advance\nsince the amount of the assets to be invested\nwithin various countries is not known. If more\nthan 50% of the total assets of a Fund at the\nclose of its taxable year consist of certain\nforeign stocks or securities, the Fund may\nelect to \u201c pass through \u201d to you certain\nforeign income taxes (including withholding\ntaxes) paid by the Fund. If a Fund in which\nyou hold Fund Shares makes such an election,\nyou will be considered to have received as an\nadditional dividend your share of such foreign\ntaxes, but you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income, or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals 59 in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not so elect, the\nFund will be entitled to claim a deduction for\ncertain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund.\nUnder certain circumstances, if a Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign taxes paid in\nrespect of a prior year, the value of Fund\nShares could be affected or any foreign tax\ncredits or deductions passed through to\nshareholders in respect of the Fund's foreign\ntaxes for the current year could be reduced.\nTaxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund Shares is generally treated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for more than one year and as short-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for one year or less, except that any\ncapital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held\nfor six months or less is treated as long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect to such Fund\nShares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of\nCreation Units. A person who exchanges\nsecurities for Creation Units generally will\nrecognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss\nwill be equal to the difference between the\nmarket value of the Creation Units at the time\nand the exchanger's aggregate basis in the\nsecurities surrendered plus any cash paid for\nthe Creation Units. A person who exchanges\nCreation Units for securities will generally\nrecognize a gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between the exchanger's basis in\nthe Creation Units and the aggregate market\nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash\nreceived. The IRS, however, may assert that a\nloss realized upon an exchange of securities\nfor Creation Units cannot be deducted\ncurrently under the rules governing \u201c wash\nsales, \u201d or on the basis that there has been\nno significant change in economic position.\nPersons exchanging securities should consult\ntheir own tax advisor with respect to whether\nwash sale rules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. Under current federal tax laws,\nany capital gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption (or creation) of Creation Units is\ngenerally treated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if the applicable Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for\nmore than one year and as a short-term capital\ngain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for one\nyear or less. If you create or redeem Creation\nUnits, you will be sent a confirmation\nstatement showing how many Fund Shares you\npurchased or sold and at what price. The Trust\non behalf of each Fund has the right to reject\nan order for Creation Units if the purchaser\n(or a group of purchasers) would, upon\nobtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own 80%\nor more of the outstanding shares of the\napplicable Fund and if, pursuant to Section\n351 of the Code, the applicable Fund would\nhave a basis in the securities different from\nthe market value of the securities on the date\nof deposit. The Trust also has the right to\nrequire information necessary to determine\nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If the Trust does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the applicable Fund, the\npurchaser (or group of purchasers) will not\nrecognize gain or loss upon the exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units. If a Fund\nredeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear\nadditional costs and recognize more capital\ngains than it would if it redeems Creation\nUnits in-kind. Non-U.S. Investors. Ordinary\nincome dividends paid by a Fund to\nshareholders who are non-resident aliens or\nforeign entities will generally be subject to\na 30% U.S. withholding tax (other than\ndistributions reported by the Fund as\ninterest-related dividends and short-term\ncapital gain dividends), unless a lower treaty\nrate applies or unless such income is\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness. In general, a Fund may report\ninterest-related dividends to the extent of\nits net income derived from U.S. source\ninterest and a Fund may report short-term\ncapital gain dividends to the extent its net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year\nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains\non the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that\nare, in each case, effectively connected with\nthe conduct of a trade or business within the\nU.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal\nnet income taxation at regular income tax\nrates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of a\nFund's shares are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning special tax rules that\nmay apply to their investment. 60 Unless\ncertain non-U.S. entities that hold Fund\nShares comply with IRS requirements that will\ngenerally require them to report information\nregarding U.S. persons investing in, or\nholding accounts with, such entities, a 30%\nwithholding tax may apply to distributions\npayable to such entities. A non-U.S.\nshareholder may be exempt from the withholding\ndescribed in this paragraph under an\napplicable intergovernmental agreement between\nthe U.S. and a foreign government, provided\nthat the shareholder and the applicable\nforeign government comply with the terms of\nsuch agreement. Backup Withholding. A Fund\nwill be required in certain cases to withhold\n(as \u201c backup withholding \u201d ) on amounts\npayable to any shareholder who (1) has\nprovided the Fund either an incorrect tax\nidentification number or no number at all, (2)\nis subject to backup withholding by the IRS\nfor failure to properly report payments of\ninterest or dividends, (3) has failed to\ncertify to the Fund that such shareholder is\nnot subject to backup withholding, or (4) has\nnot certified that such shareholder is a U.S.\nperson (including a U.S. resident alien). The\nbackup withholding rate is currently 24%.\nBackup withholding will not be applied to\npayments that have been subject to the 30%\nwithholding tax on shareholders who are\nneither citizens nor permanent residents of\nthe United States. Other Tax Issues. A Fund\nmay be subject to tax in certain states where\nthe Fund does business (or is treated as doing\nbusiness as a result of its investments).\nFurthermore, in those states which have income\ntax laws, the tax treatment of the Funds and\nof Fund shareholders with respect to\ndistributions by the Funds may differ from\nfederal tax treatment. The foregoing\ndiscussion summarizes some of the consequences\nunder current federal income tax law of an\ninvestment in the Funds. It is not a\nsubstitute for personal tax advice. Consult\nyour personal tax advisor about the potential\ntax consequences of an investment in the Funds\nunder all applicable tax laws. General\nInformation The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998.\nIf shareholders of any Fund are required to\nvote on any matters, shareholders are entitled\nto one vote for each Fund Share they own.\nAnnual meetings of shareholders will not be\nheld except as required by the 1940 Act and\nother applicable law. See the SAI for more\ninformation concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization Each\nFund is a separate series of the Trust, which\nis an open-end registered management\ninvestment company. From time to time, a Fund\nmay advertise yield and total return figures.\nYield is a historical measure of dividend\nincome, and total return is a measure of past\ndividend income (assuming that it has been\nreinvested) plus capital appreciation. Neither\nyield nor total return should be used to\npredict the future performance of a Fund.\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel\nto the Trust, including the Funds. Ernst &\nYoung LLP serves as the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and will audit the\nFunds' financial statements annually.\nFinancial Highlights These financial highlight\ntables are intended to help you understand\neach Fund's financial performance for the past\nthree fiscal years ended December 31, the six-\nmonth period ended December 31, 2019 and the\nprior two fiscal years ended June 30. Certain\ninformation reflects the performance results\nfor a single Fund Share. The total returns in\nthe table represent the rate that an investor\nwould have earned (or lost) on an investment\nin each Fund (assuming reinvestment of all\ndividends and distributions). This information\nhas been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the\nTrust's independent registered public\naccounting firm, whose report, along with each\nFund's financial highlights and financial\nstatements, is included in the annual report\nto shareholders, which is available upon\nrequest. Any references to Notes in these\nfinancial highlight tables refer to the \u201c\nNotes to Financial Statements \u201d section of\neach Fund's financial statements, and the\nfinancial information included in these tables\nshould be read in conjunction with the\nfinancial statements incorporated by reference\nin the SAI. 61\n\nSPDR SERIES TRUST\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nSelected data for a share

The offering\nof each Fund's shares ( \u201c Shares \u201d ) is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c Securities Act \u201d ). The\ninvestment objective of each Fund is to\nprovide investment results that, before fees\nand expenses, correspond generally to the\nprice and yield performance of a specified\nmarket index (each an \u201c Index \u201d and together\nthe \u201c Indexes \u201d ). SSGA Funds Management, Inc.\nserves as the investment adviser for each Fund\n( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ). Each Fund\noffers and issues Shares at their net asset\nvalue (sometimes referred to herein as \u201c NAV \u201d\n) only in aggregations of a specified number\nof Shares (each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ). Each\nFund generally offers and issues Shares in\nexchange for (i) a basket of securities\ndesignated by the Fund ( \u201c Deposit Securities\n\u201d ) together with the deposit of a specified\ncash payment ( \u201c Cash Component \u201d ) or (ii) a\ncash payment equal in value to the Deposit\nSecurities ( \u201c Deposit Cash \u201d ) together with\nthe Cash Component. The primary consideration\naccepted by a Fund (i.e., Deposit Securities\nor Deposit Cash) is set forth under \u201c Purchase\nand Redemption of Creation Units \u201d later in\nthis SAI. The Trust reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of a \u201c cash\nin lieu \u201d amount to be added to the Cash\nComponent to replace any Deposit Security and\nreserves the right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of\nDeposit Cash (subject to applicable legal\nrequirements). The Shares have been approved\nfor listing and secondary trading on a\nnational securities exchange (the \u201c Exchange \u201d\n). The Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nmarket prices. These prices may differ from\nthe Shares' net asset values. The Shares are\nalso redeemable only in Creation Unit\naggregations, and generally in exchange for\neither (i) portfolio securities and a\nspecified cash payment or (ii) cash (subject\nto applicable legal requirements). Shares may\nbe issued in advance of receipt of Deposit\nSecurities subject to various conditions\nincluding a requirement to maintain on deposit\nwith the Trust cash at least equal to a\nspecified percentage of the market value of\nthe missing Deposit Securities as set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement (as defined below).\nSee \u201c Purchase and Redemption of Creation\nUnits. \u201d The Trust may impose a transaction\nfee for each creation or redemption. In all\ncases, such fees will be limited in accordance\nwith the requirements of the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission ( \u201c SEC \u201d ) applicable\nto management investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. In addition to the\nfixed creation or redemption transaction fee,\nan additional transaction fee of up to three\ntimes the fixed creation or redemption\ntransaction fee and/or an additional variable\ncharge may apply. Investment Policies Each\nFund may invest in the following types of\ninvestments, consistent with its investment\nstrategies and objective. Please see the\nFunds' Prospectus for additional information\nregarding its principal investment strategies.\nDIVERSIFICATION STATUS The SPDR Bloomberg\nEmerging Markets Local Bond ETF, SPDR\nBloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF,\nSPDR Bloomberg Short Term International\nTreasury Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International\nGovernment Inflation-Protected Bond ETF are\neach classified as a \u201c non-diversified \u201d\ninvestment company, and the SPDR Bloomberg\nInternational Corporate Bond ETF is classified\nas a \u201c diversified \u201d investment company, under\nthe 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, a\ndiversified investment company, as to 75% of\nits total assets, may not purchase securities\nof any issuer (other than securities issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government, its agents\nor instrumentalities or securities of other\ninvestment companies) if, as a result, more\nthan 5% of its total assets would be invested\nin the securities of such issuer, or more than\n10% of the issuer's outstanding voting\nsecurities would be held by the investment\ncompany. A \u201c non-diversified \u201d classification\nmeans that a Fund is not limited by the 1940\nAct with regard to the percentage of its\nassets that may be invested in the securities\nof a single issuer. This means that a non-\ndiversified Fund may invest a greater portion\nof its assets in the securities of a single\nissuer than a diversified fund. The securities\nof a particular issuer may constitute a\ngreater portion of an Index of a Fund and,\ntherefore, the securities may constitute a\ngreater portion of the Fund's portfolio. This\nmay have an adverse effect on the Fund's\nperformance or subject the Fund's Shares to\ngreater price volatility than more diversified\ninvestment companies.\n\n3\n\nEach Fund (whether diversified or non-\ndiversified for purposes of the 1940 Act)\nintends to maintain the required level of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a \u201c regulated\ninvestment company \u201d ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and\nto relieve the Fund of any liability for\nfederal income tax to the extent that its\nearnings are distributed to shareholders.\nCompliance with the diversification\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code may\nseverely limit the investment flexibility of a\nFund and may make it less likely that the Fund\nwill meet its investment objective. ASSET-\nBACKED AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED\nSECURITIES Asset-backed securities are\nsecurities backed by installment contracts,\ncredit-card receivables or other assets.\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities are\nsecurities backed by commercial real estate\nproperties. Both asset-backed and commercial\nmortgage-backed securities represent interests\nin \u201c pools \u201d of assets in which payments of\nboth interest and principal on the securities\nare made on a regular basis. The payments are,\nin effect, \u201c passed through \u201d to the holder of\nthe securities (net of any fees paid to the\nissuer or guarantor of the securities). The\naverage life of asset-backed and commercial\nmortgage-backed securities varies with the\nmaturities of the underlying instruments and,\nas a result of prepayments, can often be less\nthan the original maturity of the assets\nunderlying the securities. For this and other\nreasons, an asset-backed and commercial\nmortgage-backed security's stated maturity may\nbe shortened, and the security's total return\nmay be difficult to predict precisely. BONDS A\nbond is an interest-bearing security issued by\na company, governmental unit or, in some\ncases, a non-U.S. entity. The issuer of a bond\nhas a contractual obligation to pay interest\nat a stated rate on specific dates and to\nrepay principal (the bond's face value)\nperiodically or on a specified maturity date;\nprovided, however, a zero coupon bond pays no\ninterest to its holder during its life. The\nvalue of a zero coupon bond to a Fund consists\nof the difference between such bond's face\nvalue at the time of maturity and the price\nfor which it was acquired, which may be an\namount significantly less than its face value\n(sometimes referred to as a \u201c deep discount \u201d\nprice). An issuer may have the right to redeem\nor \u201c call \u201d a bond before maturity, in which\ncase the investor may have to reinvest the\nproceeds at lower market rates. Most bonds\nbear interest income at a \u201c coupon \u201d rate that\nis fixed for the life of the bond. The value\nof a fixed rate bond usually rises when market\ninterest rates fall, and falls when market\ninterest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed rate\nbond's yield (income as a percent of the\nbond's current value) may differ from its\ncoupon rate as its value rises or falls. Fixed\nrate bonds generally are also subject to\ninflation risk, which is the risk that the\nvalue of the bond or income from the bond will\nbe worth less in the future as inflation\ndecreases the value of money. This could mean\nthat, as inflation increases, the \u201c real \u201d\nvalue of the assets of a Fund holding fixed\nrate bonds can decline, as can the value of\nthe Fund's distributions. Other types of bonds\nbear income at an interest rate that is\nadjusted periodically. Because of their\nadjustable interest rates, the value of \u201c\nfloating-rate \u201d or \u201c variable-rate \u201d bonds\nfluctuates much less in response to market\ninterest rate movements than the value of\nfixed rate bonds. A Fund may treat some of\nthese bonds as having a shorter maturity for\npurposes of calculating the weighted average\nmaturity of its investment portfolio. Bonds\nmay be senior or subordinated obligations.\nSenior obligations generally have the first\nclaim on a corporation's earnings and assets\nand, in the event of liquidation, are paid\nbefore subordinated obligations. Bonds may be\nunsecured (backed only by the issuer's general\ncreditworthiness) or secured (also backed by\nspecified collateral). The investment return\nof corporate bonds reflects interest on the\nbond and changes in the market value of the\nbond. The market value of a corporate bond may\nbe affected by the credit rating of the\ncorporation, the corporation's performance and\nperceptions of the corporation in the market\nplace. There is a risk that the issuers of the\nsecurities may not be able to meet their\nobligations on interest or principal payments\nat the time called for by such a security.\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER Commercial paper consists of\nshort-term, promissory notes issued by banks,\ncorporations and other entities to finance\nshort-term credit needs. These securities\ngenerally are discounted but sometimes may be\ninterest bearing.\n\n4\n\nCONCENTRATION Each Fund will concentrate its\ninvestments in securities of issuers in the\nsame industry as may be necessary to\napproximate the composition of the Fund's\nunderlying Index. The securities of issuers in\nparticular industries may dominate the\nbenchmark Index of a Fund and consequently a\nFund's investment portfolio. This may\nadversely affect a Fund's performance or\nsubject its Shares to greater price volatility\nthan that experienced by less concentrated\ninvestment companies. The Trust's general\npolicy is to exclude securities of the U.S.\ngovernment and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities when measuring industry\nconcentration. In pursuing its objective, each\nFund may hold the securities of a single\nissuer in an amount exceeding 10% of the\nmarket value of the outstanding securities of\nthe issuer, subject to restrictions imposed by\nthe Internal Revenue Code. In particular, as a\nFund's size grows and its assets increase, it\nwill be more likely to hold more than 10% of\nthe securities of a single issuer if the\nissuer has a relatively small public float as\ncompared to other components in its benchmark\nIndex. CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES Convertible\nsecurities are bonds, debentures, notes,\npreferred stock or other securities that may\nbe converted or exchanged (by the holder or by\nthe issuer) into shares of the underlying\ncommon stock (or cash or securities of\nequivalent value) at a stated exchange ratio.\nA convertible security may also be called for\nredemption or conversion by the issuer after a\nparticular date and under certain\ncircumstances (including a specified price)\nestablished upon issue. If a convertible\nsecurity held by a Fund is called for\nredemption or conversion, the Fund could be\nrequired to tender it for redemption, convert\nit into the underlying common stock, or sell\nit to a third party. Convertible securities\ngenerally have less potential for gain or loss\nthan common stock. Convertible securities\ngenerally provide yields higher than the\nunderlying common stock, but generally lower\nthan comparable non-convertible securities.\nBecause of this higher yield, convertible\nsecurities generally sell at a price above\ntheir \u201c conversion value, \u201d which is the\ncurrent market value of the stock to be\nreceived upon conversion. The difference\nbetween this conversion value and the price of\nconvertible securities will vary over time\ndepending on changes in the value of the\nunderlying common stock and interest rates.\nWhen the underlying common stock declines in\nvalue, convertible securities will tend not to\ndecline to the same extent because of the\ninterest or dividend payments and the\nrepayment of principal at maturity for certain\ntypes of convertible securities. However,\nsecurities that are convertible other than at\nthe option of the holder generally do not\nlimit the potential for loss to the same\nextent as securities convertible at the option\nof the holder. When the underlying common\nstock rises in value, the value of convertible\nsecurities may also be expected to increase.\nAt the same time, however, the difference\nbetween the market value of convertible\nsecurities and their conversion value will\nnarrow, which means that the value of\nconvertible securities will generally not\nincrease to the same extent as the value of\nthe underlying common stock. Because\nconvertible securities may also be interest-\nrate sensitive, their value may increase as\ninterest rates fall and decrease as interest\nrates rise. Convertible securities are also\nsubject to credit risk, and are often lower-\nquality securities. EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS Each\nFund may invest in other exchange-traded funds\n( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) (including ETFs managed by the\nAdviser). ETFs may be structured as investment\ncompanies that are registered under the 1940\nAct, typically as open-end funds or unit\ninvestment trusts. These ETFs are generally\nbased on specific domestic and foreign market\nsecurities indices. An \u201c index-based ETF \u201d\nseeks to provide investment results that match\nthe performance of an index by holding in its\nportfolio either the contents of the index or\na representative sample of the securities in\nthe index. An \u201c actively-managed ETF \u201d invests\nin securities based on an adviser's investment\nstrategy. An \u201c enhanced ETF \u201d seeks to provide\ninvestment results that match a positive or\nnegative multiple of the performance of an\nunderlying index. In seeking to provide such\nresults, an ETF and, in particular, an\nenhanced ETF, may engage in short sales of\nsecurities included in the underlying index\nand may invest in derivatives instruments,\nsuch as equity index swaps, futures contracts,\nand options on securities, futures contracts,\nand stock indices. Alternatively, ETFs may be\nstructured as grantor trusts or other forms of\npooled investment vehicles that are not\nregistered or regulated under the 1940 Act.\nThese ETFs typically hold commodities,\nprecious metals, currency or other non-\nsecurities investments. ETFs, like mutual\nfunds, have expenses associated with their\noperation, such as advisory and custody fees.\nWhen a Fund invests in an ETF, in addition to\ndirectly bearing expenses associated with its\nown operations, including the brokerage costs\nassociated with the purchase and sale of\nshares of the ETF, the Fund will bear a pro\nrata portion of the ETF's expenses. In\naddition, it may be more costly to own an ETF\nthan to directly own the securities or other\ninvestments held by the ETF because of ETF\nexpenses. The risks of owning shares of an ETF\ngenerally reflect the risks of owning the\nunderlying securities or other investments\nheld by the ETF, although lack of liquidity in\nthe market for the shares of an ETF could\nresult in the ETF's value being more volatile\nthan the underlying securities or other\ninvestments.\n\n5\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Each Fund may\nconduct foreign currency transactions on a\nspot (i.e., cash) or forward basis (i.e., by\nentering into forward contracts to purchase or\nsell foreign currencies). Although foreign\nexchange dealers generally do not charge a fee\nfor such conversions, they do realize a profit\nbased on the difference between the prices at\nwhich they are buying and selling various\ncurrencies. Thus, a dealer may offer to sell a\nforeign currency at one rate, while offering a\nlesser rate of exchange should the\ncounterparty desire to resell that currency to\nthe dealer. Forward contracts are customized\ntransactions that generally require a specific\namount of a currency to be delivered at a\nspecific exchange rate on a specific date or\nrange of dates in the future, although the\nFunds may also enter into non-deliverable\ncurrency forward contracts ( \u201c NDFs \u201d ) that\ncontractually require the netting of the\nparties' liabilities. Forwards, including\nNDFs, can have substantial price volatility.\nWhile foreign currency transactions on a spot\nand forward basis are exempt from the\ndefinition of \u201c swap \u201d under the Commodity\nExchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ), NDFs are not, and,\nthus, are subject to the jurisdiction of the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission ( \u201c CFTC\n\u201d ). Forward contracts are generally traded in\nan interbank market directly between currency\ntraders (usually large commercial banks) and\ntheir customers. The parties to a forward\ncontract may agree to offset or terminate the\ncontract before its maturity, or may hold the\ncontract to maturity and complete the\ncontemplated currency exchange. In the event\nthat the parties to a forward contract agree\nto offset or terminate the contract before its\nmaturity, the contract is no longer exempt\nfrom the definition of \u201c swap \u201d under the CEA\nand shall be treated as a swap. At the\ndiscretion of the Adviser, the Funds may enter\ninto forward currency exchange contracts for\nhedging purposes to help reduce the risks and\nvolatility caused by changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates, or to gain exposure\nto certain currencies in an effort to track\nthe composition of the applicable Index. When\nused for hedging purposes, they tend to limit\nany potential gain that may be realized if the\nvalue of a Fund's foreign holdings increases\nbecause of currency fluctuations. FUTURES\nCONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAP AGREEMENTS Each\nFund may invest up to 20% of its assets in\nderivatives, including exchange-traded futures\non indices, exchange-traded futures on\nTreasuries or Eurodollars, U.S. exchange-\ntraded or OTC put and call options contracts\nand exchange-traded or OTC swap transactions\n(including NDFs, interest rate swaps, total\nreturn swaps, excess return swaps, and credit\ndefault swaps). Futures and Options on\nFutures: Futures contracts generally provide\nfor the future sale by one party and purchase\nby another party of a specified commodity or\nsecurity at a specified future time and at a\nspecified price. Index futures contracts are\nsettled daily with a payment by one party to\nthe other of a cash amount based on the\ndifference between the level of the index\nspecified in the contract from one day to the\nnext. A futures contract on an index is an\nagreement pursuant to which two parties agree\nto take or make delivery of an amount of cash\nequal to the difference between the value of\nthe index at the close of the last trading day\nof the contract and the price at which the\nindex contract originally was written.\nAlthough the value of an index might be a\nfunction of the value of certain specified\nsecurities, physical delivery of these\nsecurities is not always made. A public market\nexists in futures contracts covering a number\nof indexes, as well as financial instruments,\nincluding, without limitation: U.S. Treasury\nbonds; U.S. Treasury notes; GNMA Certificates;\nthree-month U.S. Treasury bills; 90-day\ncommercial paper; bank certificates of\ndeposit; Eurodollar certificates of deposit;\nthe Australian Dollar; the Canadian Dollar;\nthe British Pound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss\nFranc; the Mexican Peso; and certain\nmultinational currencies, such as the Euro. It\nis expected that other futures contracts will\nbe developed and traded in the future. Futures\ncontracts are standardized as to maturity date\nand underlying instrument and are traded on\nfutures exchanges. The Funds may purchase and\nwrite (sell) call and put options on futures.\nOptions on futures give the holder the right,\nin return for the premium paid, to assume a\nlong position (call) or short position (put)\nin a futures contract at a specified exercise\nprice upon expiration of, or at any time\nduring the period of, the option. Upon\nexercise of a call option, the holder acquires\na long position in the futures contract and\nthe writer is assigned the opposite short\nposition. In the case of a put option, the\nopposite is true. A Fund is required to make a\ngood faith margin deposit in cash or U.S.\ngovernment securities (or other eligible\ncollateral) with a broker or custodian to\ninitiate and maintain open positions in\nfutures contracts. A margin deposit is\nintended to assure completion of the contract\n(delivery or acceptance of the underlying\ncommodity or payment of the cash settlement\namount) if it is not terminated prior to the\nspecified delivery date. Brokers may establish\ndeposit requirements which are higher than the\nexchange minimums. Futures contracts are\ncustomarily purchased and sold on margin\ndeposits which may range upward from less than\n5% of the value of the contract being traded.\n\n6\n\nAfter a futures contract position is opened,\nthe value of the contract is marked to market\ndaily. If the futures contract price changes\nto the extent that the margin on deposit does\nnot satisfy price changes, additional payments\nwill be required. Conversely, change in the\ncontract value may reduce the required margin,\nresulting in a repayment of excess margin to\nthe contract holder. Variation margin payments\nare made to and from the futures broker for as\nlong as the contract remains open. In such\ncase, a Fund would expect to earn interest\nincome on its margin deposits. Although some\nfutures contracts call for making or taking\ndelivery of the underlying commodity,\ngenerally these obligations are closed out\nprior to delivery by offsetting purchases or\nsales of matching futures contracts (involving\nthe same exchange, underlying commodity,\nsecurity or index and delivery month). If an\noffsetting purchase price is less than the\noriginal sale price, the Fund realizes a\ncapital gain, or if it is more, the Fund\nrealizes a capital loss. Conversely, if an\noffsetting sale price is more than the\noriginal purchase price, the Fund realizes a\ncapital gain, or if it is less, the Fund\nrealizes a capital loss. The transaction costs\nalso must be included in these calculations.\nOptions: A Fund may purchase and sell put and\ncall options. Such options may relate to\nparticular securities and may or may not be\nlisted on a national securities exchange and\nissued by the Options Clearing Corporation.\nOptions trading is a highly specialized\nactivity that entails greater than ordinary\ninvestment risk. Options on particular\nsecurities may be more volatile than the\nunderlying securities, and therefore, on a\npercentage basis, an investment in options may\nbe subject to greater fluctuation than an\ninvestment in the underlying securities\nthemselves. Short Sales \u201c Against the Box \u201d :\nThe Funds may engage in short sales \u201c against\nthe box. \u201d In a short sale against the box, a\nFund agrees to sell at a future date a\nsecurity that it either contemporaneously owns\nor has the right to acquire at no extra cost.\nIf the price of the security has declined at\nthe time the Fund is required to deliver the\nsecurity, the Fund will benefit from the\ndifference in the price. If the price of the\nsecurity has increased, the Fund will be\nrequired to pay the difference. Swap\nTransactions: Each Fund may enter into swap\ntransactions, including interest rate swap,\ncredit default swap, NDF, and total return\nswap transactions. Swap transactions are\ncontracts between parties in which one party\nagrees to make periodic payments to the other\nparty based on the change in market value or\nlevel of a specified rate, index or asset. In\nreturn, the other party agrees to make\npayments to the first party based on the\nreturn of a different specified rate, index or\nasset. Swap transactions will usually be done\non a net basis, i.e., where the two parties\nmake net payments with a Fund receiving or\npaying, as the case may be, only the net\namount of the two payments. The net amount of\nthe excess, if any, of a Fund's obligations\nover its entitlements with respect to each\nswap is accrued on a daily basis and an amount\nof cash or equivalents having an aggregate\nvalue at least equal to the accrued excess is\nmaintained by the Fund. Swaps may be used in\nconjunction with other instruments to offset\ninterest rate, currency or other underlying\nrisks. For example, interest rate swaps may be\noffset with \u201c caps, \u201d \u201c floors \u201d or \u201c collars.\n\u201d A \u201c cap \u201d is essentially a call option which\nplaces a limit on the amount of floating rate\ninterest that must be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u201c floor \u201d is essentially a\nput option which places a limit on the minimum\namount that would be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u201c collar \u201d is essentially\na combination of a long cap and a short floor\nwhere the limits are set at different levels.\nThe use of swap transactions by a Fund entails\ncertain risks, which may be different from, or\npossibly greater than, the risks associated\nwith investing directly in the securities and\nother investments that are the referenced\nasset for the swap agreement. Swaps are highly\nspecialized instruments that require\ninvestment techniques, risk analyses, and tax\nplanning different from those associated with\nstocks, bonds, and other traditional\ninvestments. The use of a swap requires an\nunderstanding not only of the referenced\nasset, reference rate, or index, but also of\nthe swap itself, without the benefit of\nobserving the performance of the swap under\nall the possible market conditions. Because\nsome swap transactions have a leverage\ncomponent, adverse changes in the value or\nlevel of the underlying asset, reference rate,\nor index can result in a loss substantially\ngreater than the amount invested in the swap\nitself. Certain swaps have the potential for\nunlimited loss, regardless of the size of the\ninitial investment. Bilateral OTC transactions\ndiffer from exchange-traded or cleared\nderivatives transactions in several respects.\nBilateral OTC transactions are transacted\ndirectly with dealers and not with a clearing\ncorporation. Without the availability of a\nclearing corporation, bilateral OTC\ntransaction pricing is normally done by\nreference to information from market makers\nand/or available index data, which information\nis carefully monitored by the Adviser and\nverified in appropriate cases. As bilateral\nOTC transactions are entered into directly\nwith a dealer, there is a risk of\nnonperformance by the dealer as a result of\nits insolvency or otherwise. Under regulations\nadopted by the CFTC and federal banking\nregulators ( \u201c Margin Rules \u201d ), a Fund is\nrequired to post collateral (known as\nvariation margin) to cover the mark-to-market\nexposure in respect of its uncleared swaps.\nThe Margin Rules also mandate that collateral\nin the form of initial margin be posted to\ncover\n\n7\n\npotential future exposure attributable to\nuncleared swap transactions. In the event a\nFund is required to post collateral in the\nform of initial margin or variation margin in\nrespect of its uncleared swap transactions,\nall such collateral will be posted with a\nthird party custodian pursuant to a triparty\ncustody agreement between the Fund, its dealer\ncounterparty and an unaffiliated custodian.\nThe requirement to execute certain OTC\nderivatives contracts on exchanges or\nelectronic trading platforms called swap\nexecution facilities ( \u201c SEFs \u201d ) may offer\ncertain advantages over traditional bilateral\nOTC trading, such as ease of execution, price\ntransparency, increased liquidity and/or\nfavorable pricing. However, SEF trading may\nmake it more difficult and costly for a Fund\nto enter into highly tailored or customized\ntransactions and may result in additional\ncosts and risks. Market participants such as\nthe Funds that execute derivatives contracts\nthrough a SEF, whether directly or through a\nbroker intermediary, are required to submit to\nthe jurisdiction of the SEF and comply with\nSEF and CFTC rules and regulations which\nimpose, among other things disclosure and\nrecordkeeping obligations. In addition, a Fund\nwill generally incur SEF or broker\nintermediary fees when it trades on a SEF. A\nFund may also be required to indemnify the SEF\nor broker intermediary for any losses or costs\nthat may result from the Fund's transactions\non the SEF. Total Return Swaps: A Fund may\nenter into total return swap transactions for\ninvestment purposes. Total return swaps are\ntransactions in which one party agrees to make\nperiodic payments based on the change in\nmarket value of the underlying assets, which\nmay include a specified security, basket of\nsecurities or security indexes during the\nspecified period, in return for periodic\npayments based on a fixed or variable interest\nrate of the total return from other underlying\nassets. Total return swaps may be used to\nobtain exposure to a security or market\nwithout owning or taking physical custody of\nsuch security or market, including in cases in\nwhich there may be disadvantages associated\nwith direct ownership of a particular\nsecurity. In a typical total return equity\nswap, payments made by a Fund or the\ncounterparty are based on the total return of\na particular reference asset or assets (such\nas an equity security, a combination of such\nsecurities, or an index). That is, one party\nagrees to pay another party the return on a\nstock, basket of stocks, or stock index in\nreturn for a specified interest rate. By\nentering into an equity index swap, for\nexample, the index receiver can gain exposure\nto stocks making up the index of securities\nwithout actually purchasing those stocks.\nTotal return swaps involve not only the risk\nassociated with the investment in the\nunderlying securities, but also the risk of\nthe counterparty not fulfilling its\nobligations under the agreement. Credit\nDefault Swaps: A Fund may enter into credit\ndefault swap transactions for investment\npurposes. A credit default swap transaction\nmay have as reference obligations one or more\nsecurities that are not currently held by the\nFund. A Fund may be either the protection\nbuyer or protection seller in the transaction.\nCredit default swaps may also be structured\nbased on the debt of a basket of issuers,\nrather than a single issuer, and may be\ncustomized with respect to the default event\nthat triggers purchase or other factors. As a\nprotection seller, a Fund would generally\nreceive an upfront payment or a fixed rate of\nincome throughout the term of the swap, which\ntypically is between six months and three\nyears, provided that there is no credit event.\nIf a credit event occurs, generally the\nprotection seller must pay the protection\nbuyer the full face amount of the reference\nobligations that may have little or no value.\nIf a Fund were a protection buyer and no\ncredit event occurred during the term of the\nswap, the Fund would recover nothing if the\nswap were held through its termination date.\nHowever, if a credit event occurred, the\nprotection buyer may elect to receive the full\nnotional value of the swap in exchange for an\nequal face amount of the reference obligation\nthat may have little or no value. Where a Fund\nis the protection buyer, credit default swaps\ninvolve the risk that the seller may fail to\nsatisfy its payment obligations to the Fund in\nthe event of a default. The purchase of credit\ndefault swaps involves costs, which will\nreduce a Fund's return. Currency Swaps: A Fund\nmay enter into currency swap transactions for\ninvestment purposes. Currency swaps are\nsimilar to interest rate swaps, except that\nthey involve multiple currencies. A Fund may\nenter into a currency swap when it has\nexposure to one currency and desires exposure\nto a different currency. Typically, the\ninterest rates that determine the currency\nswap payments are fixed, although occasionally\none or both parties may pay a floating rate of\ninterest. Unlike an interest rate swap,\nhowever, the principal amounts are exchanged\nat the beginning of the contract and returned\nat the end of the contract. In addition to\npaying and receiving amounts at the beginning\nand end of the transaction, both sides will\nhave to pay in full on a periodic basis based\nupon the currency they have borrowed. Change\nin foreign exchange rates and changes in\ninterest rates, as described above, may\nnegatively affect currency swaps. Interest\nRate Swaps: A Fund may enter into an interest\nrate swap in an effort to protect against\ndeclines in the value of fixed income\nsecurities held by the Fund. In such an\ninstance, the Fund may agree to pay a fixed\nrate (multiplied by a notional amount) while a\ncounterparty agrees to pay a floating rate\n(multiplied by the same notional amount). If\ninterest rates rise, resulting in a diminution\nin the value of the Fund's portfolio, the Fund\nwould receive payments under the swap that\nwould offset, in whole or in part, such\ndiminution in value.\n\n8\n\nOptions on Swaps: An option on a swap\nagreement, or a \u201c swaption, \u201d is a contract\nthat gives a counterparty the right (but not\nthe obligation) to enter into a new swap\nagreement or to shorten, extend, cancel or\notherwise modify an existing swap agreement,\nat some designated future time on specified\nterms. In return, the purchaser pays a \u201c\npremium \u201d to the seller of the contract. The\nseller of the contract receives the premium\nand bears the risk of unfavorable changes on\nthe underlying swap. A Fund may write (sell)\nand purchase put and call swaptions. A Fund\nmay also enter into swaptions on either an\nasset-based or liability-based basis,\ndepending on whether the Fund is hedging its\nassets or its liabilities. A Fund may write\n(sell) and purchase put and call swaptions to\nthe same extent it may make use of standard\noptions on securities or other instruments. A\nFund may enter into these transactions\nprimarily to preserve a return or spread on a\nparticular investment or portion of its\nholdings, as a duration management technique,\nto protect against an increase in the price of\nsecurities the Fund anticipates purchasing at\na later date, or for any other purposes, such\nas for speculation to increase returns.\nSwaptions are generally subject to the same\nrisks involved in a Fund's use of options.\nDepending on the terms of the particular\noption agreement, a Fund will generally incur\na greater degree of risk when it writes a\nswaption than it will incur when it purchases\na swaption. When a Fund purchases a swaption,\nit risks losing only the amount of the premium\nit has paid should it decide to let the option\nexpire unexercised. However, when a Fund\nwrites a swaption, upon exercise of the option\nthe Fund will become obligated according to\nthe terms of the underlying agreement.\nGovernment Regulation: The Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the\n\u201c Dodd-Frank Act \u201d ) that was signed into law\non July 21, 2010 created a new statutory\nframework that comprehensively regulated the\nover-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) derivatives\nmarkets for the first time. Prior to the Dodd-\nFrank Act, the OTC derivatives markets were\ntraditionally traded on a bilateral basis (so-\ncalled \u201c bilateral OTC transactions \u201d ). Under\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, certain OTC derivatives\ntransactions are now required to be centrally\ncleared and traded on SEFs. On October 28,\n2020, the SEC adopted Rule 18f-4 (the \u201c\nDerivatives Rule \u201d ) under the 1940 Act which\nreplaced prior SEC and staff guidance with an\nupdated, comprehensive framework for\nregistered funds' use of derivatives. The\nDerivatives Rule permits a Fund to enter into\nderivatives transactions and certain other\ntransactions notwithstanding the restrictions\non the issuance of \u201c senior securities \u201d under\nSection 18 of the 1940 Act. The Derivatives\nRule requires the Funds to trade derivatives\nand certain other instruments that create\nfuture payment or delivery obligations subject\nto a value-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ) leverage limit,\ndevelop and implement a derivatives risk\nmanagement program and new testing\nrequirements, and comply with new requirements\nrelated to board and SEC reporting. These\nrequirements apply unless a Fund qualifies as\na \u201c limited derivatives user, \u201d as defined in\nthe Derivatives Rule. Complying with the\nDerivatives Rule may increase the cost of a\nFund's investments and cost of doing business,\nwhich could adversely affect investors. Other\nnew regulations could adversely affect the\nvalue, availability and performance of certain\nderivative instruments, may make them more\ncostly, and may limit or restrict their use by\nthe Funds. Regulation Under the Commodity\nExchange Act: Each Fund intends to use\ncommodity interests, such as futures, swaps\nand options on futures in accordance with Rule\n4.5 of the CEA. A Fund may use exchange-traded\nfutures and options on futures, together with\npositions in cash and money market\ninstruments, to simulate full investment in\nits underlying Index. Exchange-traded futures\nand options on futures contracts may not be\ncurrently available for an Index. Under such\ncircumstances, the Adviser may seek to utilize\nother instruments that it believes to be\ncorrelated to the applicable Index components\nor a subset of the components. An exclusion\nfrom the definition of the term \u201c commodity\npool operator \u201d has been claimed with respect\nto each series of the Trust in accordance with\nRule 4.5 such that registration or regulation\nas a commodity pool operator under the CEA is\nnot necessary. Restrictions on Trading in\nCommodity Interests: Each Fund reserves the\nright to engage in transactions involving\nfutures, options thereon and swaps to the\nextent allowed by the CFTC regulations in\neffect from time to time and in accordance\nwith a Fund's policies. Certain additional\nrisk factors related to derivatives are\ndiscussed below: Derivatives Risk: Under\nrecently adopted rules by the CFTC,\ntransactions in some types of interest rate\nswaps and index credit default swaps on North\nAmerican and European indices are required to\nbe cleared. In addition, the CFTC may\npromulgate additional regulations that require\nclearing of other classes of swaps. In a\ncleared derivatives transaction (which\nincludes futures, options on futures, and\ncleared swaps transactions), a Fund's\ncounterparty is a clearing house (such as CME,\nICE Clear Credit or LCH.Clearnet), rather than\na bank or broker. Since each Fund is not a\nmember of a clearing house and only members of\na clearing house can participate directly in\nthe clearing house, a Fund holds cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers, who are futures commission merchants\nthat are members of the clearing houses and\nwho have the appropriate regulatory\n\n9\n\napprovals to engage in cleared derivatives\ntransactions. A Fund makes and receives\npayments owed under cleared derivatives\ntransactions (including margin payments)\nthrough its accounts at clearing members.\nClearing members guarantee performance of\ntheir clients' obligations to the clearing\nhouse. In contrast to bilateral OTC\ntransactions, clearing members generally can\nrequire termination of existing cleared\nderivatives transactions at any time and\nincreases in margin above the margin that it\nrequired at the beginning of a transaction.\nClearing houses also have broad rights to\nincrease margin requirements for existing\ntransactions and to terminate transactions in\naccordance with their rules. Any such increase\nor termination could interfere with the\nability of a Fund to pursue its investment\nstrategy. Also, a Fund is subject to execution\nrisk if it enters into a derivatives\ntransaction that is required to be cleared (or\nthat the Advisor expects to be cleared), and\nno clearing member is willing or able to clear\nthe transaction on the Fund's behalf. While\nthe documentation in place between a Fund and\nits clearing members generally provides that\nthe clearing members will accept for clearing\nall transactions submitted for clearing that\nare within credit limits specified by the\nclearing members in advance, the Fund could be\nsubject to this execution risk if the Fund\nsubmits for clearing transactions that exceed\nsuch credit limits, if the clearing house does\nnot accept the transactions for clearing, or\nif the clearing members do not comply with\ntheir agreement to clear such transactions. In\nthat case, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the benefit of any increase in the\nvalue of the transaction after the time of the\ntransaction. In addition, new regulations\ncould, among other things, restrict a Fund's\nability to engage in, or increase the cost to\nthe Fund of, derivatives transactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available to the Fund or increasing\nmargin or capital requirements. If a Fund is\nnot able to enter into a particular\nderivatives transaction, the Fund's investment\nperformance and risk profile could be\nadversely affected as a result. Counterparty\nRisk: Counterparty risk with respect to OTC\nderivatives may be affected by new regulations\npromulgated by the CFTC and SEC affecting the\nderivatives market. As described under \u201c\nDerivatives Risk \u201d above, all futures and\noptions on futures and some swap transactions\nare required to be cleared, and a party to a\ncleared derivatives transaction is subject to\nthe credit risk of the clearing house and the\nclearing member through which it holds its\ncleared derivatives position, rather than the\ncredit risk of its original counterparty to\nthe derivative transaction. Clearing members\nare required to segregate all funds received\nfrom customers with respect to cleared\nderivatives transactions from the clearing\nmember's proprietary assets. However, all\nfunds and other property received by a\nclearing broker from its customers are\ngenerally held by the clearing broker on a\ncommingled basis in an omnibus account, and\nthe clearing broker may also invest those\nfunds in certain instruments permitted under\nthe applicable regulations. Also, the clearing\nmember transfers to the clearing house the\namount of margin required by the clearing\nhouse for cleared derivatives transactions,\nwhich amounts are generally held in the\nrelevant omnibus account at the clearing house\nfor all customers of the clearing member. For\ncommodities futures positions, the clearing\nhouse may use all of the collateral held in\nthe clearing member's omnibus account to meet\na loss in that account, without regard to\nwhich customer in fact supplied that\ncollateral. Accordingly, in addition to\nbearing the credit risk of its clearing\nmember, each customer to a futures transaction\nalso bears \u201c fellow customer \u201d risk from other\ncustomers of the clearing member. However,\nwith respect to cleared swaps positions,\nrecent regulations promulgated by the CFTC\nrequire that the clearing member notify the\nclearing house of the amount of initial margin\nprovided by the clearing member to the\nclearing house that is attributable to each\ncustomer. Because margin in respect of cleared\nswaps must be earmarked for specific clearing\nmember customers, the clearing house may not\nuse the collateral of one customer to cover\nthe obligations of another customer. However,\nif the clearing member does not provide\naccurate reporting, a Fund is subject to the\nrisk that a clearing house will use the Fund's\nassets held in an omnibus account at the\nclearing house to satisfy payment obligations\nof a defaulting customer of the clearing\nmember to the clearing house. In addition,\nclearing members may generally choose to\nprovide to the clearing house the net amount\nof variation margin required for cleared swaps\nfor all of its customers in the aggregate,\nrather than the gross amount for each\ncustomer. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS A Fund may take\nadvantage of opportunities in the area of\noptions and futures contracts, options on\nfutures contracts, warrants, swaps and any\nother investments which are not presently\ncontemplated for use by the Fund or which are\nnot currently available but which may be\ndeveloped, to the extent such opportunities\nare both consistent with the Fund's investment\nobjective and legally permissible for the\nFund. Before entering into such transactions\nor making any such investment, a Fund will\nprovide appropriate disclosure.\n\n10\n\nHIGH YIELD SECURITIES Investment in high yield\nsecurities (commonly known as \u201c junk \u201d bonds)\ngenerally provides greater income and\nincreased opportunity for capital appreciation\nthan investments in higher quality securities,\nbut they also typically entail greater price\nvolatility and credit risk. These high yield\nsecurities are regarded as predominantly\nspeculative with respect to the issuer's\ncontinuing ability to meet principal and\ninterest payments. Analysis of the\ncreditworthiness of issuers of debt securities\nthat are high yield may be more complex than\nfor issuers of higher quality debt securities.\nIn addition, high yield securities are often\nissued by smaller, less creditworthy companies\nor by highly leveraged (indebted) firms, but\ncan also be issued by governments. Such\nissuers are generally less able than more\nfinancially stable issuers to make scheduled\npayments of interest and principal. The risks\nposed by securities issued under such\ncircumstances are substantial. Investing in\nhigh yield debt securities involves risks that\nare greater than the risks of investing in\nhigher quality debt securities. These risks\ninclude: (i) changes in credit status,\nincluding weaker overall credit conditions of\nissuers and risks of default; (ii) industry,\nmarket and economic risk; and (iii) greater\nprice variability and credit risks of certain\nhigh yield securities such as zero coupon and\npayment-in-kind securities. While these risks\nprovide the opportunity for maximizing return\nover time, they may result in greater\nvolatility of the value of a Fund than a fund\nthat invests in higher-rated securities.\nFurthermore, the value of high yield\nsecurities may be more susceptible to real or\nperceived adverse economic, company or\nindustry conditions than is the case for\nhigher quality securities. The market values\nof certain of these lower-rated and unrated\ndebt securities tend to reflect individual\nissuer developments to a greater extent than\ndo higher-rated securities which react\nprimarily to fluctuations in the general level\nof interest rates, and tend to be more\nsensitive to economic conditions than are\nhigher-rated securities. Adverse market,\ncredit or economic conditions could make it\ndifficult at certain times to sell certain\nhigh yield securities held by a Fund. The\nsecondary market on which high yield\nsecurities are traded may be less liquid than\nthe market for higher grade securities. Less\nliquidity in the secondary trading market\ncould adversely affect the price at which a\nFund could sell a high yield security, and\ncould adversely affect the daily net asset\nvalue per share of a Fund. When secondary\nmarkets for high yield securities are less\nliquid than the market for higher grade\nsecurities, it may be more difficult to value\nthe securities because there is less reliable,\nobjective data available. The use of credit\nratings as a principal method of selecting\nhigh yield securities can involve certain\nrisks. For example, credit ratings evaluate\nthe safety of principal and interest payments,\nnot the market value risk of high yield\nsecurities. Also, credit rating agencies may\nfail to change credit ratings in a timely\nfashion to reflect events since the security\nwas last rated. ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS Each Fund\nmay invest in illiquid investments. A Fund may\nnot acquire any illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the acquisition, the Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments. An illiquid\ninvestment means any investment that a Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without the sale or\ndisposition significantly changing the market\nvalue of the investment. If illiquid\ninvestments exceed 15% of a Fund's net assets,\ncertain remedial actions will be taken as\nrequired by Rule 22e-4 under the 1940 Act and\nthe Funds' policies and procedures. INFLATION-\nPROTECTED OBLIGATIONS Each Fund may invest in\ninflation-protected public obligations,\ncommonly known as \u201c TIPS, \u201d of the U.S.\nTreasury, as well as TIPS of major governments\nand emerging market countries, excluding the\nUnited States. TIPS are a type of security\nissued by a government that are designed to\nprovide inflation protection to investors.\nTIPS are income-generating instruments whose\ninterest and principal payments are adjusted\nfor inflation\u2014a sustained increase in prices\nthat erodes the purchasing power of money. The\ninflation adjustment, which is typically\napplied monthly to the principal of the bond,\nfollows a designated inflation index, such as\nthe Consumer Price Index. A fixed coupon rate\nis applied to the inflation-adjusted principal\nso that as inflation rises or falls, both the\nprincipal value and the interest payments will\nincrease or decrease. This can provide\ninvestors with a hedge against inflation, as\nit helps preserve the purchasing power of an\ninvestment. Because of this inflation\nadjustment feature, inflation-protected bonds\ntypically have lower yields than conventional\nfixed-rate bonds.\n\n11\n\nINVESTMENT COMPANIES Each Fund may invest in\nthe securities of other investment companies,\nincluding affiliated funds and money market\nfunds, subject to applicable limitations under\nSection 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to\nSection 12(d)(1), a Fund may invest in the\nsecurities of another investment company (the\n\u201c acquired company \u201d ) provided that the Fund,\nimmediately after such purchase or\nacquisition, does not own in the aggregate:\n(i) more than 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the acquired company; (ii)\nsecurities issued by the acquired company\nhaving an aggregate value in excess of 5% of\nthe value of the total assets of the Fund; or\n(iii) securities issued by the acquired\ncompany and all other investment companies\n(other than Treasury stock of the Fund) having\nan aggregate value in excess of 10% of the\nvalue of the total assets of the Fund. To the\nextent allowed by law, regulation, and/or a\nFund's investment restrictions, a Fund may\ninvest its assets in securities of investment\ncompanies, including affiliated funds and/or\nmoney market funds, in excess of the limits\ndiscussed above. If a Fund invests in and,\nthus, is a shareholder of, another investment\ncompany, the Fund's shareholders will\nindirectly bear the Fund's proportionate share\nof the fees and expenses paid by such other\ninvestment company, including advisory fees,\nin addition to both the management fees\npayable directly by the Fund to the Fund's own\ninvestment adviser and the other expenses that\nthe Fund bears directly in connection with the\nFund's own operations. LENDING PORTFOLIO\nSECURITIES Each Fund may lend portfolio\nsecurities to certain creditworthy borrowers\nin U.S. and non-U.S. markets in an amount not\nto exceed 40% of the value of its net assets.\nThe borrowers provide collateral that is\nmarked to market daily in an amount at least\nequal to the current market value of the\nsecurities loaned. A Fund may terminate a loan\nat any time and obtain the securities loaned.\nA Fund receives the value of any interest or\ncash or non-cash distributions paid on the\nloaned securities. A Fund cannot vote proxies\nfor securities on loan, but may recall loans\nto vote proxies if a material issue affecting\nthe Fund's economic interest in the investment\nis to be voted upon. Efforts to recall such\nsecurities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly\ntraded securities. Distributions received on\nloaned securities in lieu of dividend payments\n(i.e., substitute payments) would not be\nconsidered qualified dividend income. With\nrespect to loans that are collateralized by\ncash, the borrower will be entitled to receive\na fee based on the amount of cash collateral.\nA Fund is compensated by the difference\nbetween the amount earned on the reinvestment\nof cash collateral and the fee paid to the\nborrower. In the case of collateral other than\ncash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid by\nthe borrower equal to a percentage of the\nmarket value of the loaned securities. Any\ncash collateral may be reinvested in certain\nhigh quality short-term instruments either\ndirectly on behalf of the lending Fund or\nthrough one or more joint accounts or funds,\nwhich may include those managed by the\nAdviser. A Fund could lose money due to a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or any investments made\nwith cash collateral. Certain non-cash\ncollateral or investments made with cash\ncollateral may have a greater risk of loss\nthan other non-cash collateral or investments.\nA Fund may pay a portion of the interest or\nfees earned from securities lending to a\nborrower as described above, and to one or\nmore securities lending agents approved by the\nBoard of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201c Board \u201d\n) who administer the lending program for the\nFunds in accordance with guidelines approved\nby the Board. In such capacity, the lending\nagent provides the following services to the\nFunds in connection with the Funds' securities\nlending activities: (i) locating borrowers\namong an approved list of prospective\nborrowers; (ii) causing the delivery of loaned\nsecurities from a Fund to borrowers; (iii)\nmonitoring the value of loaned securities, the\nvalue of collateral received, and other\nlending parameters; (iv) seeking additional\ncollateral, as necessary, from borrowers; (v)\nreceiving and holding collateral from\nborrowers, and facilitating the investment and\nreinvestment of all or substantially all cash\ncollateral in an investment vehicle designated\nby the Funds; (vi) returning collateral to\nborrowers; (vii) facilitating substitute\ndividend, interest, and other distribution\npayments to the Funds from borrowers; (viii)\nnegotiating the terms of each loan of\nsecurities, including but not limited to the\namount of any loan premium, and monitoring the\nterms of securities loan agreements with\nprospective borrowers for consistency with the\nrequirements of the Funds' Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement; (ix) selecting\nsecurities, including amounts (percentages),\nto be loaned; (x) recordkeeping and accounting\nservicing; and (xi) arranging for return of\nloaned securities to the Fund in accordance\nwith the terms of the Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement. State Street Bank and\nTrust Company ( \u201c State Street \u201d ), an\naffiliate of the Trust, has been approved by\nthe Board to serve as securities lending agent\nfor the Funds and the Trust has entered into\nan agreement with State Street for such\nservices. Among other matters, the Trust has\nagreed to indemnify State Street for certain\nliabilities. State Street has received an\norder of exemption from the SEC under Sections\n17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the 1940 Act to serve\nas the lending agent for affiliated investment\ncompanies such as the Trust and to invest the\ncash collateral received from loan\ntransactions to be invested in an affiliated\ncash collateral fund.\n\n12\n\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess especially so in certain international\nmarkets such as Taiwan), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e.,\nthe risk of a mismatch between the return on\ncash collateral reinvestments and the fees a\nFund has agreed to pay a borrower), risk of\nloss of collateral, credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risk. If a securities\nlending counterparty were to default, a Fund\nwould be subject to the risk of a possible\ndelay in receiving collateral or in recovering\nthe loaned securities, or to a possible loss\nof rights in the collateral. In the event a\nborrower does not return a Fund's securities\nas agreed, the Fund may experience losses if\nthe proceeds received from liquidating the\ncollateral do not at least equal the value of\nthe loaned security at the time the collateral\nis liquidated, plus the transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nAlthough State Street has agreed to provide a\nFund with indemnification in the event of a\nborrower default, a Fund is still exposed to\nthe risk of losses in the event a borrower\ndoes not return a Fund's securities as agreed.\nFor example, delays in recovery of lent\nsecurities may cause a Fund to lose the\nopportunity to sell the securities at a\ndesirable price. LEVERAGING While the Funds do\nnot anticipate doing so, a Fund may borrow\nmoney in an amount greater than 5% of the\nvalue of the Fund's total assets. However,\nunder normal circumstances, a Fund will not\nborrow money from a bank in an amount greater\nthan 10% of the value of the Fund's total\nassets. Borrowing for investment purposes is\none form of leverage. Leveraging investments,\nby purchasing securities with borrowed money,\nis a speculative technique that increases\ninvestment risk, but also increases investment\nopportunity. Because substantially all of a\nFund's assets will fluctuate in value, whereas\nthe interest obligations on borrowings may be\nfixed, the NAV of a Fund will increase more\nwhen such Fund's portfolio assets increase in\nvalue and decrease more when the Fund's\nportfolio assets decrease in value than would\notherwise be the case. Moreover, interest\ncosts on borrowings may fluctuate with\nchanging market rates of interest and may\npartially offset or exceed the returns on the\nborrowed funds. OTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS\nEach Fund may invest in short-term\ninstruments, including money market\ninstruments, (including money market funds\nadvised by the Adviser), cash and cash\nequivalents, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by the Adviser); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c\nCDs \u201d ), bankers' acceptances, fixed time\ndeposits and other obligations of U.S. and\nforeign banks (including foreign branches) and\nsimilar institutions; (iv) commercial paper\nrated at the date of purchase \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by\nMoody's Investors Service ( \u201c Moody's \u201d ) or \u201c\nA-1 \u201d by S&P Global Ratings ( \u201c S&P \u201d ), or if\nunrated, of comparable quality as determined\nby the Adviser; (v) non-convertible corporate\ndebt securities (e.g., bonds and debentures)\nwith remaining maturities at the date of\npurchase of not more than 397 days and that\npresent minimal credit risk; and (vi) short-\nterm U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of\nforeign banks (including U.S. branches) that,\nin the opinion of the Adviser, are of\ncomparable quality to obligations of U.S.\nbanks which may be purchased by a Fund. Any of\nthese instruments may be purchased on a\ncurrent or a forward-settled basis. Time\ndeposits are non-negotiable deposits\nmaintained in banking institutions for\nspecified periods of time at stated interest\nrates. Bankers' acceptances are time drafts\ndrawn on commercial banks by borrowers,\nusually in connection with international\ntransactions. Money market instruments also\ninclude shares of money market funds. The SEC\nand other government agencies continue to\nreview the regulation of money market funds.\nThe SEC has adopted changes to the rules that\ngovern money market funds, and compliance with\nmany of these amendments was required in\nOctober 2016. Legislative developments may\nalso affect money market funds. These changes\nand developments may affect the investment\nstrategies, performance, yield, operating\nexpenses and continued viability of a money\nmarket fund. PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND RESTRICTED\nSECURITIES Each Fund may invest in securities\nthat are purchased in private placements and,\naccordingly, are subject to restrictions on\nresale as a matter of contract or under\nfederal securities laws. While such private\nplacements may offer attractive opportunities\nfor investment not otherwise available on the\nopen market, the securities so purchased are\noften \u201c restricted securities, \u201d i.e.,\nsecurities which cannot be sold to the public\nwithout registration under the Securities Act\nor the availability of an exemption from\nregistration (such as Rules 144 or 144A), or\nwhich are not readily marketable because they\nare subject to other legal or contractual\ndelays in or restrictions on resale. Generally\nspeaking, restricted securities may be\n\n13\n\nsold only to qualified institutional buyers,\nor in a privately negotiated transaction to a\nlimited number of purchasers, or in limited\nquantities after they have been held for a\nspecified period of time and other conditions\nare met pursuant to an exemption from\nregistration, or in a public offering for\nwhich a registration statement is in effect\nunder the Securities Act. Because there may be\nrelatively few potential purchasers for such\ninvestments, especially under adverse market\nor economic conditions or in the event of\nadverse changes in the financial condition of\nthe issuer, a Fund could find it more\ndifficult to sell such securities when the\nAdviser believes it advisable to do so or may\nbe able to sell such securities only at prices\nlower than if such securities were more widely\nheld. Market quotations for such securities\nare generally less readily available than for\npublicly traded securities. The absence of a\ntrading market can make it difficult to\nascertain a market value for such securities\nfor purposes of computing a Fund's net asset\nvalue, and the judgment of the Adviser may at\ntimes play a greater role in valuing these\nsecurities than in the case of publicly traded\nsecurities. Disposing of such securities,\nwhich may be illiquid investments, can involve\ntime-consuming negotiation and legal expenses,\nand it may be difficult or impossible for a\nFund to sell them promptly at an acceptable\nprice. A Fund may have to bear the extra\nexpense of registering such securities for\nresale and the risk of substantial delay in\neffecting such registration. A Fund may be\ndeemed to be an \u201c underwriter \u201d for purposes\nof the Securities Act when selling restricted\nsecurities to the public, and in such event\nthe Fund may be liable to purchasers of such\nsecurities if the registration statement\nprepared by the issuer, or the prospectus\nforming a part of it, is materially inaccurate\nor misleading. RATINGS An investment grade\nrating means the security or issuer is rated\ninvestment grade by Moody's, S&P, Fitch\nRatings, Inc. ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ), Dominion Bond\nRating Service Limited, or another credit\nrating agency designated as a nationally\nrecognized statistical rating organization by\nthe SEC, or is unrated but considered to be of\nequivalent quality by the Adviser. Subsequent\nto purchase by a Fund, a rated security may\ncease to be rated or its investment grade\nrating may be reduced below an investment\ngrade rating. Bonds rated lower than Baa3 by\nMoody's or BBB- by S&P or Fitch are below\ninvestment grade quality and are obligations\nof issuers that are considered predominantly\nspeculative with respect to the issuer's\ncapacity to pay interest and repay principal\naccording to the terms of the obligation and,\ntherefore, carry greater investment risk,\nincluding the possibility of issuer default\nand bankruptcy and increased market price\nvolatility. Such securities ( \u201c lower rated\nsecurities \u201d ) are commonly referred to as \u201c\njunk \u201d bonds and are subject to a substantial\ndegree of credit risk. Lower rated securities\nare often issued by smaller, less creditworthy\ncompanies or by highly leveraged (indebted)\nfirms, which are generally less able than more\nfinancially stable firms to make scheduled\npayments of interest and principal. The risks\nposed by securities issued under such\ncircumstances are substantial. Bonds rated\nbelow investment-grade tend to be less\nmarketable than higher-quality bonds because\nthe market for them is less broad. The market\nfor unrated bonds is even narrower. See \u201c HIGH\nYIELD SECURITIES \u201d above for more information\nrelating to the risks associated with\ninvesting in lower rated securities, or\nAppendix A for more information on the ratings\nof debt instruments. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\nEach Fund may invest in repurchase agreements\nwith commercial banks, brokers or dealers to\ngenerate income from its excess cash balances\nand to invest securities lending cash\ncollateral. A repurchase agreement is an\nagreement under which a Fund acquires a\nfinancial instrument (e.g., a security issued\nby the U.S. government or an agency thereof, a\nbanker's acceptance or a certificate of\ndeposit) from a seller, subject to resale to\nthe seller at an agreed upon price and date\n(normally, the next Business Day\u2014as defined\nbelow). A repurchase agreement may be\nconsidered a loan collateralized by\nsecurities. The resale price reflects an\nagreed upon interest rate effective for the\nperiod the instrument is held by a Fund and is\nunrelated to the interest rate on the\nunderlying instrument. In these repurchase\nagreement transactions, the securities\nacquired by a Fund (including accrued interest\nearned thereon) must have a total value in\nexcess of the value of the repurchase\nagreement and are held by the Custodian until\nrepurchased. No more than an aggregate of 15%\nof a Fund's net assets will be invested in\nilliquid investments, including repurchase\nagreements having maturities longer than seven\ndays and securities subject to legal or\ncontractual restrictions on resale, or for\nwhich there are no readily available market\nquotations. The use of repurchase agreements\ninvolves certain risks. For example, if the\nother party to the agreement defaults on its\nobligation to repurchase the underlying\nsecurity at a time when the value of the\nsecurity has declined, a Fund may incur a loss\nupon disposition of the security. If the other\nparty to the agreement becomes insolvent and\nsubject to liquidation or\n\n14\n\nreorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code\nor other laws, a court may determine that the\nunderlying security is collateral for a loan\nby a Fund not within the control of the Fund\nand, therefore, the Fund may not be able to\nsubstantiate its interest in the underlying\nsecurity and may be deemed an unsecured\ncreditor of the other party to the agreement.\nREVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS Each Fund may\nenter into reverse repurchase agreements,\nwhich involve the sale of securities with an\nagreement to repurchase the securities at an\nagreed-upon price, date and interest payment\nand have the characteristics of borrowing. The\nsecurities purchased with the funds obtained\nfrom the agreement and securities\ncollateralizing the agreement will have\nmaturity dates no later than the repayment\ndate. Generally the effect of such\ntransactions is that a Fund can recover all or\nmost of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases a Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are only\nadvantageous if a Fund has an opportunity to\nearn a greater rate of interest on the cash\nderived from these transactions than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available and a Fund intends to use\nthe reverse repurchase technique only when the\nAdviser believes it will be advantageous to\nthe Fund. The use of reverse repurchase\nagreements may exaggerate any interim increase\nor decrease in the value of a Fund's assets. A\nFund may enter into reverse repurchase\nagreements if it either meets the relevant\nasset coverage requirements of Section 18 of\nthe 1940 Act for senior securities\nrepresenting indebtedness, or elects to treat\nsuch arrangements as derivatives transactions\nunder the Derivatives Rule. Each Fund does not\nexpect to engage, under normal circumstances,\nin reverse repurchase agreements with respect\nto more than 10% of its total assets.\nSOVEREIGN DEBT OBLIGATIONS Sovereign debt\nobligations are issued or guaranteed by\nforeign governments or their agencies.\nSovereign debt may be in the form of\nconventional securities or other types of debt\ninstruments such as loans or loan\nparticipations. Governmental entities\nresponsible for repayment of the debt may be\nunable or unwilling to repay principal and pay\ninterest when due, and may require\nrenegotiation or reschedule of debt payments.\nIn addition, prospects for repayment of\nprincipal and payment of interest may depend\non political as well as economic factors.\nAlthough some sovereign debt, such as Brady\nBonds, is collateralized by U.S. Government\nsecurities, repayment of principal and payment\nof interest is not guaranteed by the U.S.\nGovernment. U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS U.S.\nGovernment obligations are a type of bond.\nU.S. Government obligations include securities\nissued or guaranteed as to principal and\ninterest by the U.S. Government, its agencies\nor instrumentalities. One type of U.S.\nGovernment obligation, U.S. Treasury\nobligations, are backed by the full faith and\ncredit of the U.S. Treasury and differ only in\ntheir interest rates, maturities, and times of\nissuance. U.S. Treasury bills have initial\nmaturities of one-year or less; U.S. Treasury\nnotes have initial maturities of one to ten\nyears; and U.S. Treasury bonds generally have\ninitial maturities of greater than ten years.\nOther U.S. Government obligations are issued\nor guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities\nof the U.S. Government including, but not\nlimited to, Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d ), the Government\nNational Mortgage Association ( \u201c Ginnie Mae \u201d\n), the Small Business Administration, the\nFederal Farm Credit Administration, the\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( \u201c\nFreddie Mac \u201d ), the Federal Home Loan Banks (\n\u201c FHLB \u201d ), Banks for Cooperatives (including\nthe Central Bank for Cooperatives), the\nFederal Land Banks, the Federal Intermediate\nCredit Banks, the Tennessee Valley Authority,\nthe Export-Import Bank of the United States,\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation, the Federal\nFinancing Bank, the Student Loan Marketing\nAssociation, the National Credit Union\nAdministration and the Federal Agricultural\nMortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac). Some\nobligations issued or guaranteed by U.S.\nGovernment agencies and instrumentalities,\nincluding, for example, Ginnie Mae pass-\nthrough certificates, are supported by the\nfull faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury.\nOther obligations issued by or guaranteed by\nfederal agencies, such as those securities\nissued by Fannie Mae, are supported by the\ndiscretionary authority of the U.S. Government\nto purchase certain obligations of the federal\nagency, while other obligations issued by or\nguaranteed by federal agencies, such as those\nof the Federal Home Loan Banks, are supported\nby the right of the issuer to borrow from the\nU.S. Treasury. While the U.S. Government\nprovides financial support to such U.S.\nGovernment-sponsored federal agencies, no\nassurance can be given that the U.S.\nGovernment will always do so, since the U.S.\nGovernment is not so obligated by law.\n\n15\n\nIn September 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced\na federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac, placing the two federal instrumentalities\nin conservatorship. Under the terms of the\ntakeover, the U.S. Treasury agreed to acquire\n$1 billion of senior preferred stock of each\ninstrumentality and obtained warrants for the\npurchase of common stock of each\ninstrumentality. Under these Senior Preferred\nStock Purchase Agreements ( \u201c SPAs \u201d ), the\nU.S. Treasury has pledged to provide a limited\namount of capital per instrumentality as\nneeded, including the contribution of cash\ncapital to the instrumentalities in the event\ntheir liabilities exceed their assets. In May\n2009, the U.S. Treasury increased its maximum\ncommitment to each instrumentality under the\nSPAs from $100 billion to $200 billion per\ninstrumentality. In December 2009, the U.S.\nTreasury amended the SPAs to provide Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac with some additional\nflexibility to meet the requirement to reduce\ntheir mortgage portfolios. Also in December\n2009, the U.S. Treasury further amended the\nSPAs to allow the cap on the U.S. Treasury's\nfunding commitment to increase as necessary to\naccommodate any cumulative reduction in Fannie\nMae's and Freddie Mac's net worth through the\nend of 2012. On August 17, 2012, the U.S.\nTreasury announced that it was again amending\nthe SPAs to terminate the requirement that\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac each pay a 10%\ndividend annually on all amounts received\nunder the funding commitment. Instead, they\nwere required to transfer to the U.S. Treasury\non a quarterly basis all profits earned during\na quarter that exceeded a capital reserve\namount of $3 billion. On September 30, 2019,\nthe U.S. Treasury announced amendments to the\nSPAs permitting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to\nmaintain capital reserves of $25 billion and\n$20 billion, respectively. It is believed that\nthe amendment puts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nin a better position to service their debt\nbecause the companies no longer have to borrow\nfrom the U.S. Treasury to make fixed dividend\npayments. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the\nsubject of several continuing class action\nlawsuits and investigations by federal\nregulators over certain accounting, disclosure\nor corporate governance matters, which (along\nwith any resulting financial restatements) may\nadversely affect the guaranteeing entities.\nImportantly, the future of the entities is in\nserious question as the U.S. government\nreportedly is considering multiple options,\nranging from nationalization, privatization,\nconsolidation, or abolishment of the entities.\nVARIABLE AND FLOATING RATE SECURITIES Variable\nrate securities are instruments issued or\nguaranteed by entities such as (1) U.S.\nGovernment, or an agency or instrumentality\nthereof, (2) states, municipalities and other\npolitical subdivisions, agencies, authorities\nand instrumentalities or states and multi-\nstate agencies or authorities, (3)\ncorporations, (4) financial institutions, (5)\ninsurance companies or (6) trusts that have a\nrate of interest subject to adjustment at\nregular intervals but less frequently than\nannually. A variable rate security provides\nfor the automatic establishment of a new\ninterest rate on set dates. Variable rate\nobligations whose interest is readjusted no\nless frequently than annually will be deemed\nto have a maturity equal to the period\nremaining until the next readjustment of the\ninterest rate. A Fund may also purchase\nfloating rate securities. A floating rate\nsecurity provides for the automatic adjustment\nof its interest rate whenever a specified\ninterest rate changes. Interest rates on these\nsecurities are ordinarily tied to, and are a\npercentage of, a widely recognized interest\nrate, such as the yield on 90-day U.S.\nTreasury bills or the prime rate of a\nspecified bank. These rates may change as\noften as twice daily. Generally, changes in\ninterest rates will have a smaller effect on\nthe market value of variable and fixed rate\nfloating rate securities than on the market\nvalue of comparable fixed rate fixed income\nobligations. Thus, investing in variable and\nfixed rate floating rate securities generally\nallows less opportunity for capital\nappreciation and depreciation than investing\nin comparable fixed rate fixed income\nsecurities. VARIABLE RATE DEMAND OBLIGATIONS\nVariable rate demand obligations ( \u201c VRDOs \u201d )\nare short-term tax-exempt fixed income\ninstruments whose yield is reset on a periodic\nbasis. VRDO securities tend to be issued with\nlong maturities of up to 30 or 40 years;\nhowever, they are considered short-term\ninstruments because they include a put feature\nwhich coincides with the periodic yield reset.\nFor example, a VRDO whose yield resets weekly\nwill have a put feature that is exercisable\nupon seven days' notice. VRDOs are put back to\na bank or other entity that serves as a\nliquidity provider, who then tries to resell\nthe VRDOs or, if unable to resell, holds them\nin its own inventory. VRDOs are generally\nsupported by either a Letter of Credit or a\nStand-by Bond Purchase Agreement to provide\ncredit enhancement.\n\n16\n\nWHEN-ISSUED SECURITIES Each Fund may purchase\nsecurities on a when-issued basis. Delivery of\nand payment for these securities may take\nplace as long as a month or more after the\ndate of the purchase commitment. The value of\nthese securities is subject to market\nfluctuation during this period, and no income\naccrues to a Fund until settlement takes\nplace. When entering into a when-issued\ntransaction, a Fund will rely on the other\nparty to consummate the transaction; if the\nother party fails to do so, a Fund may be\ndisadvantaged. Securities purchased on a when-\nissued basis and held by a Fund are subject to\nchanges in market value based upon actual or\nperceived changes in the level of interest\nrates. Generally, the value of such securities\nwill fluctuate inversely to changes in\ninterest rates \u2014 i.e., they will appreciate in\nvalue when interest rates decline and decrease\nin value when interest rates rise. Therefore,\nif a Fund purchases securities on a \u201c when-\nissued \u201d basis, there may be a greater\npossibility of fluctuation in the Fund's NAV.\nSpecial Considerations and Risks A discussion\nof the risks associated with an investment in\neach Fund is contained in the Prospectus. The\ndiscussion below supplements, and should be\nread in conjunction with, the Prospectus.\nGENERAL Investment in a Fund should be made\nwith an understanding that the value of a\nFund's portfolio securities may fluctuate in\naccordance with changes in the financial\ncondition of the issuers of the portfolio\nsecurities, the value of securities generally\nand other factors. An investment in a Fund\nshould also be made with an understanding of\nthe risks inherent in an investment in\nsecurities, including the risk that the\nfinancial condition of issuers may become\nimpaired or that the general condition of the\nsecurities markets may deteriorate (either of\nwhich may cause a decrease in the value of the\nportfolio securities and thus in the value of\nShares). Securities are susceptible to general\nmarket fluctuations and to volatile increases\nand decreases in value as market confidence in\nand perceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic and banking\ncrises. Securities of issuers traded on\nexchanges may be suspended on certain\nexchanges by the issuers themselves, by an\nexchange or by government authorities. The\nlikelihood of such suspensions may be higher\nfor securities of issuers in emerging or less-\ndeveloped market countries than in countries\nwith more developed markets. Trading\nsuspensions may be applied from time to time\nto the securities of individual issuers for\nreasons specific to that issuer, or may be\napplied broadly by exchanges or governmental\nauthorities in response to market events.\nSuspensions may last for significant periods\nof time, during which trading in the\nsecurities and instruments that reference the\nsecurities, such as participatory notes (or \u201c\nP-notes \u201d ) or other derivative instruments,\nmay be halted. The principal trading market\nfor some of the securities in an Index may be\nin the over-the-counter market. The existence\nof a liquid trading market for certain\nsecurities may depend on whether dealers will\nmake a market in such securities. There can be\nno assurance that a market will be made or\nmaintained or that any such market will be or\nremain liquid. The price at which securities\nmay be sold and the value of a Fund's Shares\nwill be adversely affected if trading markets\nfor a Fund's portfolio securities are limited\nor absent or if bid/ask spreads are wide.\nCHINA BOND RISK Certain Funds may invest in\nrenminbi ( \u201c RMB \u201d ) denominated fixed income\nsecurities of Chinese issuers ( \u201c China bonds\n\u201d ). To the extent a Fund's underlying Index\nincludes China bonds, the Fund's ability to\nachieve its investment objective is dependent\non its continued access to such bonds. The\nFunds may invest in China bonds (i) through\ndirect access to the China Interbank Bond\nMarket ( \u201c CIBM \u201d ), (ii) through certain\nforeign institutional investors that have\nobtained a license from the Chinese\nregulators, and (iii) through Bond Connect, a\nprogram that provides foreign investors with\naccess to China's onshore bond market. CIBM\nDirect Access Program Risks: The CIBM is an\nOTC market established in 1997, and accounts\nfor more than 95% of outstanding bond values\nof the total trading volume in the People's\nRepublic of China (the \u201c PRC \u201d ). On CIBM,\ndomestic institutional investors and certain\nforeign institutional investors can trade, on\na one-to-one quote-driven basis, sovereign\nbonds, government bonds, corporate bonds, bond\nrepo, bond lending, bills issued by the\nPeople's Bank of China\n\n17\n\n( \u201c PBOC \u201d ) and other financial debt\ninstruments. Pursuant to the Announcement\n(2016) No. 3 issued by the PBOC on February\n24, 2016, eligible foreign institutional\ninvestors can conduct trading on the CIBM\nunder a program established by the PBOC ( \u201c\nCIBM Direct Access Program \u201d ) subject to\nother rules and regulations as promulgated by\nthe PRC authorities. There is no trading quota\nlimitation. CIBM is regulated and supervised\nby the PBOC. The PBOC is responsible for,\namong others, promulgating the applicable CIBM\nlisting, trading and operating rules, and\nsupervising the market operators of CIBM.\nBonds and bond-related derivatives are traded\nin the CIBM primarily through (i) independent\nbilateral negotiation on a transaction by\ntransaction basis or (ii) through the \u201c click-\nand-deal \u201d trading model, whereby a party\noffers a quote in the market that can then be\naccepted by a counterparty (thus, \u201c clicking \u201d\nthe \u201c deal \u201d ). A \u201c click-and-deal \u201d quote may\nalso be automatically matched with a price\nlimit order. In addition, recently an \u201c\nanonymous click \u201d trading model has been\nimplemented for certain bonds and bond-related\nderivatives whereby anonymous quotes offered\nin the market are automatically matched with\ncounterparties based on timing and price. Once\na transaction is agreed upon, the parties\nwill, in accordance with the terms of the\ntransaction, promptly send instructions for\nthe delivery of bonds and funds. Parties are\nrequired to have sufficient bonds and funds\nfor delivery on the agreed upon delivery date.\nChina Central Depository & Clearing Co., Ltd (\n\u201c CCDC \u201d ) or Shanghai Clearing House ( \u201c SHCH\n\u201d ) will deliver bonds according to the\ninstructions sent by the parties. Funds\nclearing banks will handle the transfer and\nsettlement of the payments of the bonds on\nbehalf of the parties. The China Foreign\nExchange Trading System is the unified trading\nplatform for CIBM. A Fund's investments in\nChina bonds through the CIBM Direct Access\nProgram will be subject to a number of\nadditional risks and restrictions that may\naffect the Fund's investments and returns.\nCertain of these risks are discussed below.\nThe CIBM Direct Access Program is relatively\nnew. Laws, rules, regulations, policies,\nnotices, circulars or guidelines relating to\nthe CIBM Direct Access Program as published or\napplied by the PBOC and other PRC authorities\nare relatively untested and are subject to\nchange from time to time. There can be no\nassurance that the CIBM Direct Access Program\nwill not be restricted, suspended or\nabolished. If such event occurs, a Fund's\nability to invest in the CIBM through the CIBM\nDirect Access Program will be adversely\naffected, and if the Fund is unable to\nadequately access the CIBM through other\nmeans, the Fund's ability to achieve its\ninvestment objective will be adversely\naffected. Under the prevailing PRC\nregulations, eligible foreign institutional\ninvestors who wish to invest directly in CIBM\nthrough the CIBM Direct Access Program may do\nso through an onshore settlement agent, who\nwould be responsible for making the relevant\nfilings and account opening with the relevant\nauthorities. The Funds are therefore subject\nto the risk of default or errors on the part\nof such agent. QFI Investment Risk: The\nRenminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional\nInvestor ( \u201c RQFII \u201d ) and Qualified Foreign\nInstitutional Investor ( \u201c QFII \u201d ) regimes\nhave been combined, effective May 2020, with a\nunified set of rules applicable to all RQFIIs\nand QFIIs by the Chinese regulators\n(collectively referred to as \u201c Qualified\nForeign Investor \u201d or \u201c QFI \u201d ) Investment\ncompanies, such as the Funds, are not\ncurrently within the types of entities that\nare eligible for QFI license. Rather, each\nFund may utilize the Adviser's QFI license\ngranted under QFI regulations to invest in\nChina bonds. It is possible that the Adviser's\nQFI status could be suspended or revoked.\nPursuant to PRC and QFI regulations, the State\nAdministration of Foreign Exchange ( \u201c SAFE \u201d\n) and the China Securities Regulatory\nCommission ( \u201c CSRC \u201d ) are vested with the\npower to impose regulatory sanctions if the\nAdviser, in its capacity as QFI, or the PRC\ncustodian violates any provision of the QFI\nregulations. Any such violations could result\nin the revocation of the Adviser's QFI license\nor other regulatory sanctions and may\nadversely affect the ability of a Fund to\ninvest in China bonds. The Adviser is also\nsubject to regulation by certain Hong Kong\nregulatory authorities, including the Hong\nKong Securities and Futures Commission.\nRegulatory matters arising from such\nregulation could also adversely affect the\nAdviser's QFI license and ability to provide\nadvisory services, generally. There can be no\nassurance that the Adviser will continue to\nmaintain its QFI status. In the event the\nAdviser is unable to maintain its QFI status,\nit may be necessary for the Fund to limit or\nsuspend creations of Creation Units. In such\nevent it is possible that the trading price of\nthe Fund's Shares on its Exchange will be at a\nsignificant premium to the NAV (which may also\nincrease tracking error of the Fund). In\nextreme circumstances, a Fund may incur\nsignificant loss due to limited investment\ncapabilities, or may not be able fully to\nimplement or pursue its investment objectives\nor strategies, due to QFI investment\nrestrictions, illiquidity of the PRC\nsecurities markets, and delay or disruption in\nexecution of trades or in settlement of\ntrades. The regulations which regulate\ninvestments by QFIs in the PRC and the\nrepatriation of capital from QFI investments\nare relatively new. The application and\ninterpretation of such investment regulations\nare therefore relatively untested and there is\nno certainty as to how they will be applied as\nthe PRC authorities and regulators have been\ngiven wide discretion in\n\n18\n\nsuch investment regulations and there is no\nprecedent or certainty as to how such\ndiscretion may be exercised now or in the\nfuture. Existing QFI regulations may change\nover time and new QFI regulations may be\npromulgated in the future and no assurance can\nbe given that any such changes will not\nadversely affect a Fund or its ability to\nachieve its investment objective. Bond Connect\nRisks: The \u201c Mutual Bond Market Access between\nMainland China and Hong Kong \u201d ( \u201c Bond\nConnect \u201d ) program is a new initiative\nestablished by PBOC, China Foreign Exchange\nTrade System & National Interbank Funding\nCentre ( \u201c CFETS \u201d ), CCDC, SHCH, and Hong\nKong Exchanges and Clearing Limited ( \u201c HKEx \u201d\n) and Central Moneymarkets Unit ( \u201c CMU \u201d ) of\nthe Hong Kong Monetary Authority ( \u201c HKMA \u201d )\nto facilitate investor's investments between\nthe Mainland China and Hong Kong bond markets\nthrough connection between the Mainland China\nand Hong Kong financial institutions. Under\nthe prevailing PRC regulations, eligible\nforeign investors are allowed to invest in the\nbonds available on the CIBM through the\nnorthbound trading of Bond Connect ( \u201c\nNorthbound Trading Link \u201d ). There is\ncurrently no investment quota for the\nNorthbound Trading Link. The Northbound\nTrading Link refers to the trading platform\nthat is located outside of Mainland China and\nis connected to CFETS for eligible foreign\ninvestors to submit their trade requests for\nbonds circulated in the CIBM through Bond\nConnect. HKEx and CFETS work together with\noffshore electronic bond trading platforms to\nprovide electronic trading services and\nplatforms to allow direct trading between\neligible foreign investors and approved\nonshore dealers in Mainland China through\nCFETS. Under the Northbound Trading Link,\neligible foreign investors are required to\nappoint the CFETS or other institutions\nrecognized by the PBOC as registration agents\nto apply for registration with the PBOC.\nPursuant to the prevailing regulations in\nMainland China, the CMU, the offshore custody\nagent recognized by the HKMA, opens omnibus\nnominee accounts with the onshore custody\nagent recognized by the PBOC (i.e., the CCDC\nand SHCH). All bonds traded by eligible\nforeign investors will be registered in the\nname of the CMU, which will hold such bonds as\na nominee owner. Bond Connect is relatively\nnew. Laws, rules, regulations, policies,\nnotices, circulars or guidelines relating to\nBond Connect as published or applied by any of\nthe Bond Connect Authorities (as defined\nbelow) are relatively untested and are subject\nto change. \u201c Bond Connect Authorities \u201d refers\nto the exchanges, trading systems, settlement\nsystems, governmental, regulatory or tax\nbodies which provide services and/or regulate\nBond Connect and activities relating to Bond\nConnect, including, without limitation, the\nPBOC, the HKMA, the HKEx, the CFETS, the CMU,\nthe CCDC and the SHCH and any other regulator,\nagency or authority with jurisdiction,\nauthority or responsibility in respect of Bond\nConnect. There can be no assurance that Bond\nConnect will not be restricted, suspended or\nabolished. If such event occurs, a Fund's\nability to invest in the CIBM through Bond\nConnect may be adversely affected, and if the\nFund is unable to adequately access the CIBM\nthrough other means, the Fund's ability to\nachieve its investment objective may be\nadversely affected. Under the prevailing Bond\nConnect regulations, eligible foreign\ninvestors who wish to participate in Bond\nConnect may do so through an offshore custody\nagent, registration agent or other third\nparties (as the case may be), who would be\nresponsible for making the relevant filings\nand account opening with the relevant\nauthorities. A Fund is therefore subject to\nthe risk of default or errors on the part of\nsuch agents. Trading through Bond Connect is\nperformed through newly developed trading\nplatforms and operational systems. There is no\nassurance that such systems will function\nproperly (in particular, under extreme market\nconditions) or will continue to be adapted to\nchanges and developments in the market. In the\nevent that the relevant systems fail to\nfunction properly, trading through Bond\nConnect may be disrupted. A Fund's ability to\ntrade through Bond Connect (and hence to\npursue its investment strategy) may therefore\nbe adversely affected. In addition, where a\nFund invests in the CIBM through Bond Connect,\nit may be subject to risks of delays inherent\nin the order placing and/or settlement. The\nCMU is the \u201c nominee holder \u201d of the bonds\nacquired by a Fund through Bond Connect. While\nBond Connect Authorities have expressly stated\nthat investors will enjoy the rights and\ninterests of the bonds acquired through Bond\nConnect similar to investors in bond interests\nacquired through more traditional means in\naccordance with applicable laws, the exercise\nand the enforcement of beneficial ownership\nrights in such bonds in the Chinese courts has\nyet to be tested. As a result, for example,\nthough the HKMA has stated otherwise in its\nFrequently Asked Questions relating to Bond\nConnect, it is possible that in the event that\nthe nominee holder becomes insolvent, such\nbonds may be deemed to form part of the pool\nof assets of the nominee holder available for\ndistribution to its creditors thereby\nsubjugating the rights of a Fund.\n\n19\n\nChinese Credit Rating Risks: China bonds will\ngenerally be rated by Chinese ratings agencies\n(and not by U.S. nationally recognized\nstatistical ratings organizations ( \u201c NRSROs \u201d\n)). The rating criteria and methodology used\nby Chinese rating agencies may be different\nfrom those adopted by NRSROs and international\ncredit rating agencies. Therefore, such rating\nsystems may not provide an equivalent standard\nfor comparison with securities rated by NRSROs\nand international credit rating agencies.\nMarket Risks: A Fund investing in the CIBM\nwill be subject to liquidity and volatility\nrisks. Market volatility and potential lack of\nliquidity due to possible low trading volume\nof certain bonds in the CIBM may result in\nprices of certain bonds traded in the CIBM\nfluctuating significantly. The bid and offer\nspreads of the prices of such bonds may be\nlarge, and a Fund may therefore incur\nsignificant trading and realization costs and\nmay even suffer losses when selling such\ninvestments. To the extent that a Fund\ntransacts in the CIBM, the Fund may also be\nexposed to risks associated with settlement\nprocedures and default of counterparties. The\ncounterparty which has entered into a\ntransaction with a Fund may default in its\nobligation to settle the transaction by\nfailure to deliver relevant securities or to\nmake payment. General PRC-Related Risks\nEconomic, Political and Social Risks of the\nPRC: The economy of China, which has been in a\nstate of transition from a planned economy to\na more market-oriented economy, differs from\nthe economies of most developed countries in\nmany respects, including the level of\ngovernment involvement, its state of\ndevelopment, its growth rate, control of\nforeign exchange, protection of intellectual\nproperty rights and allocation of resources.\nAlthough the majority of productive assets in\nChina are still owned by the PRC government at\nvarious levels, in recent years, the PRC\ngovernment has implemented economic reform\nmeasures emphasizing utilization of market\nforces in the development of the economy of\nChina and a high level of management autonomy.\nThe economy of China has experienced\nsignificant growth in the past several\ndecades, but growth has been uneven both\ngeographically and among various sectors of\nthe economy, and no assurance can be given\nthat such growth will continue. Economic\ngrowth has also been accompanied by periods of\nhigh inflation. The PRC government has\nimplemented various measures from time to time\nto control inflation and restrain the rate of\neconomic growth. There can, however, be no\nassurance that the PRC government will\ncontinue to pursue such economic policies or,\nif it does, that those policies will continue\nto be successful. Any such adjustment and\nmodification of those economic policies may\nhave an adverse impact on the securities\nmarkets in the PRC as well as the portfolio\nsecurities of a Fund. Further, the PRC\ngovernment may from time to time adopt\ncorrective measures to control the growth of\nthe PRC economy, which may also have an\nadverse impact on the capital growth and\nperformance of a Fund. Political changes,\nsocial instability and adverse diplomatic\ndevelopments in the PRC could result in the\nimposition of additional government\nrestrictions, including expropriation of\nassets, confiscatory taxes, limits on\nrepatriation, or nationalization of some or\nall of the property held by the underlying\nissuers of a Fund's portfolio securities. PRC\nLaws and Regulations Risk: The regulatory and\nlegal framework for capital markets and\ncompanies in the PRC may not be as well\ndeveloped as those of developed countries. PRC\nlaws and regulations affecting securities\nmarkets are relatively new and evolving, and\nbecause of the limited volume of published\ncases and judicial interpretation and their\nnon-binding nature, interpretation and\nenforcement of these regulations involve\nsignificant uncertainties. In addition, as the\nPRC legal system develops, no assurance can be\ngiven that changes in such laws and\nregulations or new laws, regulations or\npractices relating to transactions in Chinese\nsecurities will be promulgated, or that their\ninterpretation or enforcement will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on a Fund's portfolio\nsecurities. In addition, the effect of future\ndevelopments in the PRC legal system is\nunpredictable, such as changes to the existing\nregulatory environment and government scrutiny\nin certain areas, uncertain interpretation and\nimplementation of existing laws or enforcement\nthereof, or the preemption of local\nregulations by national laws. For instance,\nChina has tightened regulatory requirements\nwith respect to privacy, data protection and\ninformation security, and has promulgated new\nregulations and policy to regulate certain\nindustries in the past year, which may in turn\nimpact the business operation of the\nunderlying issuers of a Fund's portfolio\nsecurities. The rapid evolving legal system of\nChina may have a material adverse effect on a\nFund's portfolio securities. PRC Tax Risk:\nUncertainties in PRC tax rules governing\ntaxation of income and gains from investments\nin China bonds could result in unexpected tax\nliabilities for a Fund. A Fund's investments\nin China bonds may cause the Fund to become\nsubject to withholding and other taxes imposed\nby the PRC. The Ministry of Finance of the PRC\nand the State Administration of Taxation of\nthe PRC issued Caishui No. 108 on November 7,\n2018, which states that bond interests derived\nfrom investment in the China bond market\n(including through CIBM, a QFI license or Bond\nConnect) by foreign investors will be\ntemporarily exempt from withholding income tax\nand value added tax. According to the\nAnnouncement on\n\n20\n\nContinuation of Corporate Income Tax and\nValue-added Tax Policies for Overseas\nInstitutions Investing in the Domestic Bond\nMarket (Announcement [2021] No. 34), which was\njointly made by the Ministry of Finance and\nthe State Administration of Taxation on\nNovember 22, 2021, the temporary exemption\napplies to the withholding tax and value-added\ntax on bond interest derived from investment\nin the China bond market by foreign\ninstitutional investors and will continue\nuntil December 31, 2025. If, in the future,\nChina begins applying tax rules regarding the\ntaxation of investment in China bonds by\nforeign investors, and/or begins collecting\nwithholding and other taxes on interest\nderived by such investment, a Fund's return\nmight be adversely affected. Political Tension\nRisk: Recently there have been heightened\ntensions in international economic relations\nand rising political tensions. In particular,\npolitical tensions between the United States\nand China have escalated due to, among other\nthings, trade disputes, the COVID-19 outbreak,\nsanctions imposed by the U.S. Department of\nTreasury on certain officials of the Hong Kong\nSpecial Administrative Region and the PRC\ncentral government, as well as retaliatory\nactions of the PRC government. Rising\npolitical tensions could reduce levels of\ntrade, investments and other economic\nactivities between the two major economies,\nand any escalation thereof may have a negative\nimpact on the general, economic, political,\nand social conditions in China and, in turn,\nadversely impact a Fund's portfolio\nsecurities. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK An\ninvestment in a Fund may be subject to a\nnumber of actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest. For example, the Adviser or its\naffiliates may provide services to a Fund,\nsuch as securities lending agency services,\ncustodial, administrative, bookkeeping, and\naccounting services, transfer agency and\nshareholder servicing, securities brokerage\nservices, and other services for which the\nFund would compensate the Adviser and/or such\naffiliates. A Fund may invest in other pooled\ninvestment vehicles sponsored, managed, or\notherwise affiliated with the Adviser. There\nis no assurance that the rates at which a Fund\npays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its\naffiliates, or the terms on which it enters\ninto transactions with the Adviser or its\naffiliates, will be the most favorable\navailable in the market generally or as\nfavorable as the rates the Adviser makes\navailable to other clients. Because of its\nfinancial interest, the Adviser may have an\nincentive to enter into transactions or\narrangements on behalf of a Fund with itself\nor its affiliates in circumstances where it\nmight not have done so in the absence of that\ninterest. CONTINUOUS OFFERING The method by\nwhich Creation Units of Shares are created and\ntraded may raise certain issues under\napplicable securities laws. Because new\nCreation Units of Shares are issued and sold\nby the Trust on an ongoing basis, at any point\na \u201c distribution, \u201d as such term is used in\nthe Securities Act, may occur. Broker-dealers\nand other persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nwhich could render them statutory underwriters\nand subject them to the prospectus delivery\nand liability provisions of the Securities\nAct. For example, a broker-dealer firm or its\nclient may be deemed a statutory underwriter\nif it takes Creation Units after placing an\norder with the Distributor, breaks them down\ninto constituent Shares, and sells such Shares\ndirectly to customers, or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of a supply of new Shares\nwith an active selling effort involving\nsolicitation of secondary market demand for\nShares. A determination of whether one is an\nunderwriter for purposes of the Securities Act\nmust take into account all the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the activities of\nthe broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case, and the examples mentioned\nabove should not be considered a complete\ndescription of all the activities that could\nlead to a categorization as an underwriter.\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\neffecting transactions in Shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nShares, are generally required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\nSecurities Act is not available in respect of\nsuch transactions as a result of Section 24(d)\nof the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a\nprospectus-delivery obligation with respect to\nShares of a Fund are reminded that under\nSecurities Act Rule 153, a prospectus-delivery\nobligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the\nSecurities Act owed to an exchange member in\nconnection with a sale on the Exchange is\nsatisfied by the fact that a Fund's Prospectus\nis available at the Exchange upon request. The\nprospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule\n153 is only available with respect to\ntransactions on an exchange.\n\n21\n\nSSGA or its affiliates (the \u201c Selling\nShareholder \u201d ) may purchase Creation Units\nthrough a broker-dealer to \u201c seed \u201d (in whole\nor in part) Funds as they are launched, or may\npurchase shares from broker-dealers or other\ninvestors that have previously provided \u201c seed\n\u201d for Funds when they were launched or\notherwise in secondary market transactions,\nand because the Selling Shareholder may be\ndeemed an affiliate of such Funds, the Shares\nare being registered to permit the resale of\nthese shares from time to time after purchase.\nThe Funds will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese Shares. The Selling Shareholder intends\nto sell all or a portion of the Shares owned\nby it and offered hereby from time to time\ndirectly or through one or more broker-\ndealers, and may also hedge such positions.\nThe Shares may be sold on any national\nsecurities exchange on which the Shares may be\nlisted or quoted at the time of sale, in the\nover-the-counter market or in transactions\nother than on these exchanges or systems at\nfixed prices, at prevailing market prices at\nthe time of the sale, at varying prices\ndetermined at the time of sale, or at\nnegotiated prices. These sales may be effected\nin transactions, which may involve cross or\nblock transactions. The Selling Shareholder\nmay also loan or pledge Shares to broker-\ndealers that in turn may sell such Shares, to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. The\nSelling Shareholder may also enter into\noptions or other transactions with broker-\ndealers or other financial institutions or the\ncreation of one or more derivative securities\nwhich require the delivery to such broker-\ndealer or other financial institution of\nShares, which Shares such broker-dealer or\nother financial institution may resell. The\nSelling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or\nagents participating in the distribution of\nShares may be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the\nSecurities Act in connection with such sales.\nIn such event, any commissions paid to any\nsuch broker-dealer or agent and any profit on\nthe resale of the Shares purchased by them may\nbe deemed to be underwriting commissions or\ndiscounts under the Securities Act. The\nSelling Shareholder who may be deemed an \u201c\nunderwriter \u201d within the meaning of Section\n2(a)(11) of the Securities Act will be subject\nto the applicable prospectus delivery\nrequirements of the Securities Act.\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK Counterparty risk with\nrespect to derivatives has been and may\ncontinue to be affected by new rules and\nregulations affecting the derivatives market.\nSome derivatives transactions are required to\nbe centrally cleared, and a party to a cleared\nderivatives transaction is subject to the\ncredit risk of the clearing house and the\nclearing member through which it holds its\ncleared position, rather than the credit risk\nof its original counterparty to the\nderivatives transaction. Credit risk of market\nparticipants with respect to derivatives that\nare centrally cleared is concentrated in a few\nclearing houses, and it is not clear how an\ninsolvency proceeding of a clearing house\nwould be conducted, what effect the insolvency\nproceeding would have on any recovery by a\nFund, and what impact an insolvency of a\nclearing house would have on the financial\nsystem more generally. FUTURES AND OPTIONS\nTRANSACTIONS There can be no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market will exist for any\nparticular futures contract or option at any\nspecific time. Thus, it may not be possible to\nclose a futures or options position. In the\nevent of adverse price movements, a Fund would\ncontinue to be required to make daily cash\npayments to maintain its required margin. In\nsuch situations, if a Fund has insufficient\ncash, it may have to sell portfolio securities\nto meet daily margin requirements at a time\nwhen it may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, a Fund may be required to make\ndelivery of the instruments underlying futures\ncontracts it has sold. Each Fund will minimize\nthe risk that it will be unable to close out a\nfutures or options contract by only entering\ninto futures and options for which there\nappears to be a liquid secondary market. The\nrisk of loss in trading futures contracts or\nuncovered call options in some strategies\n(e.g., selling uncovered index futures\ncontracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds\ndo not plan to use futures and options\ncontracts, when available, in this manner. The\nrisk of a futures position may still be large\nas traditionally measured due to the low\nmargin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. A Fund, however, may utilize futures\nand options contracts in a manner designed to\nlimit its risk exposure to that which is\ncomparable to what it would have incurred\nthrough direct investment in securities.\n\n22\n\nUtilization of futures transactions by a Fund\ninvolves the risk of imperfect or even\nnegative correlation to its benchmark Index if\nthe index underlying the futures contracts\ndiffers from the benchmark Index or if the\nfutures contracts do not track the benchmark\nIndex as expected. There is also the risk of\nloss by a Fund of margin deposits in the event\nof bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has\nan open position in the futures contract or\noption. Certain financial futures exchanges\nlimit the amount of fluctuation permitted in\nfutures contract prices during a single\ntrading day. The \u201c daily price fluctuation\nlimit \u201d or \u201c daily limit \u201d establishes the\nmaximum amount that the price of a futures\ncontract may vary either up or down from the\nprevious day's settlement price at the end of\na trading session. Once the daily limit has\nbeen reached in a particular type of contract,\ngenerally no trades may be made on that day at\na price beyond that limit. The daily limit\ngoverns only price movement during a\nparticular trading day and therefore does not\nlimit potential losses, because the limit may\nprevent the liquidation of unfavorable\npositions. Futures contract prices have\noccasionally moved to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting some futures traders to substantial\nlosses. RISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS Swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nswap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, a Fund\nwill have contractual remedies pursuant to the\nagreements related to the transaction, but\nsuch remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and\ninsolvency laws which could affect the Fund's\nrights as a creditor. The use of interest-rate\nand index swaps is a highly specialized\nactivity that involves investment techniques\nand risks different from those associated with\nordinary portfolio security transactions. The\nuse of a swap requires an understanding not\nonly of the referenced asset, reference rate,\nor index, but also of the swap itself, without\nthe benefit of observing the performance of\nthe swap under all possible market conditions.\nThese transactions generally do not involve\nthe delivery of securities or other underlying\nassets or principal. The absence of a\nregulated execution facility or contract\nmarket and lack of liquidity for swap\ntransactions has led, in some instances, to\ndifficulties in trading and valuation,\nespecially in the event of market disruptions.\nUnder recently adopted rules and regulations,\ntransactions in some types of swaps are\nrequired to be centrally cleared. In a cleared\nderivatives transaction, a Fund's counterparty\nto the transaction is a central derivatives\nclearing organization, or clearing house,\nrather than a bank or broker. Because the\nFunds are not members of a clearing house, and\nonly members of a clearing house can\nparticipate directly in the clearing house,\neach Fund holds cleared derivatives through\naccounts at clearing members. In cleared\nderivatives transactions, a Fund will make\npayments (including margin payments) to and\nreceive payments from a clearing house through\nits accounts at clearing members. Clearing\nmembers guarantee performance of their\nclients' obligations to the clearing house.\nCentrally cleared derivative arrangements may\nbe less favorable to a Fund than bilateral\n(non-cleared) arrangements. For example, a\nFund may be required to provide greater\namounts of margin for cleared derivatives\ntransactions than for bilateral derivatives\ntransactions. Also, in contrast to bilateral\nderivatives transactions, in some cases\nfollowing a period of notice to a Fund, a\nclearing member generally can require\ntermination of existing cleared derivatives\ntransactions at any time or an increase in\nmargin requirements above the margin that the\nclearing member required at the beginning of a\ntransaction. Clearing houses also have broad\nrights to increase margin requirements for\nexisting transactions or to terminate\ntransactions at any time in accordance with\ntheir rules. A Fund is subject to risk if it\nenters into a derivatives transaction that is\nrequired to be cleared (or which SSGA FM\nexpects to be cleared), and no clearing member\nis willing or able to clear the transaction on\nthe Fund's behalf. In that case, the\ntransaction might have to be terminated, and\nthe Fund could lose some or all of the benefit\nof the transaction, including loss of an\nincrease in the value of the transaction and\nloss of hedging protection. In addition, the\ndocumentation governing the relationship\nbetween a Fund and clearing members is drafted\nby the clearing members and generally is less\nfavorable to the Fund than typical bilateral\nderivatives documentation. These clearing\nrules and other new rules and regulations\ncould, among other things, restrict a Fund's\nability to engage in, or increase the cost to\nthe Fund of, derivatives transactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available to the Fund, increasing\nmargin or capital requirements, or otherwise\nlimiting liquidity or increasing transaction\ncosts. These regulations, as applicable to\nswaps, are relatively new and evolving, so\ntheir potential impact on a Fund and the\nfinancial system are not yet known.\n\n23\n\nBecause they are two party contracts that may\nbe subject to contractual restrictions on\ntransferability and termination and because\nthey may have terms of greater than seven\ndays, swap agreements may be considered to be\nilliquid and subject to a Fund's limitation on\ninvestments in illiquid investments. To the\nextent that a swap is not liquid, it may not\nbe possible to initiate a transaction or\nliquidate a position at an advantageous time\nor price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Like most other investments, swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nmarket value of the instrument will change in\na way detrimental to a Fund's interest. If a\nFund uses a swap as a hedge against, or as a\nsubstitute for, a portfolio investment, the\nFund will be exposed to the risk that the swap\nwill have or will develop imperfect or no\ncorrelation with the portfolio investment.\nThis could cause substantial losses for the\nFund. While hedging strategies involving swap\ninstruments can reduce the risk of loss, they\ncan also reduce the opportunity for gain or\neven result in losses by offsetting favorable\nprice movements in other Fund investments.\nMany swaps are complex and often valued\nsubjectively. EUROPE \u2013 RECENT EVENTS A number\nof countries in Europe, including Greece,\nSpain, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal, have\nsubstantial government debt levels. The\nconcern over these debt levels has led to\nvolatility in the European financial markets,\nwhich has adversely affected the exchange rate\nof the euro and may continue to significantly\naffect every country in Europe. For some\ncountries, the ability to repay sovereign debt\nis in question, and default is possible, which\ncould affect their ability to borrow in the\nfuture. Several countries have agreed to\nmulti-year bailout loans from the European\nCentral Bank, the IMF, and other institutions.\nA default or debt restructuring by any\nEuropean country can adversely impact holders\nof that country's debt and can affect\nexposures to other European Union ( \u201c EU \u201d )\ncountries and their financial companies as\nwell. These financial difficulties may\ncontinue, worsen or spread within or outside\nEurope. Responses to the financial problems by\nEuropean governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not work, may result in social\nunrest and may limit future growth and\neconomic recovery or have other unintended\nconsequences. Uncertainties regarding the\nviability of the EU have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact markets in the United\nStates and around the world. On January 31,\n2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew\nfrom the EU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit\n\u201d ) and entered an 11-month transition period.\nThe transition period concluded on December\n31, 2020, and the United Kingdom left the EU\nsingle market and customs union under the\nterms of a new trade agreement. The agreement\ngoverns the new relationship between the\nUnited Kingdom and EU with respect to trading\ngoods and services, but critical aspects of\nthe relationship remain unresolved and subject\nto further negotiation and agreement. The full\nscope and nature of the consequences of the\nexit are not at this time known and are\nunlikely to be known for a significant period\nof time. It is also unknown whether the United\nKingdom's exit will increase the likelihood of\nother countries also departing the EU. Any\nadditional exits from the EU, or the\npossibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of a Fund's\ninvestments. LIBOR RISK Instruments or\ncontracts in which the Funds invest may pay\ninterest at floating or adjusting rates based\non LIBOR or may be subject to interest caps or\nfloors tied to LIBOR. LIBOR is used\nextensively in the U.S. and globally as a\nbenchmark or reference rate for various\ncommercial and financial contracts, including\ncorporate and municipal bonds, bank loans,\nasset-backed and mortgage-related securities,\ninterest rate swaps and other derivatives. On\nJuly 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial\nConduct Authority (FCA), which regulates\nLIBOR, announced that after 2021, it would\ncease its active encouragement of banks to\nprovide quotations needed to sustain the LIBOR\nrate. On March 5, 2021, the administrator of\nLIBOR announced a delay in the phase out of\nthe majority of the USD LIBOR publications\nuntil June 30, 2023, with the remainder of USD\nLIBOR publications having ceased on December\n31, 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in\nconjunction with the Alternative Reference\nRates Committee, a steering committee\ncomprised of large U.S. financial\ninstitutions, has identified the Secured\nOvernight Financial Rate (SOFR) as the\npreferred alternative rate to LIBOR. SOFR is a\nrelatively new index calculated by short-term\nrepurchase agreements, backed by Treasury\nsecurities. While some instruments or\ncontracts may contemplate a scenario where\nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for\nan alternative rate setting methodology, not\nall instruments or contracts may have such \u201c\nfallback provisions. \u201d Abandonment of or\nmodifications to LIBOR could lead to\nsignificant short-term and long-term\nuncertainty and market instability and the\nextent to which that may impact a Fund may\nvary depending on various factors, which\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i)\n\n24\n\nexisting fallback or termination provisions in\nindividual contracts and (ii) whether, how,\nand when industry participants develop and\nadopt new successor reference rates and/or\nfallbacks for both legacy and new instruments\nor contracts. To address the potential risks\nand uncertainty associated with instruments or\ncontracts containing no fallback provisions,\nin March 2022, the Biden administration\nenacted legislation that provides a uniform\nnational approach for replacing USD LIBOR. In\ninstances where a contract or instrument does\nnot contain an effective fallback provision,\nthe USD LIBOR rate will be replaced by a rate\nbased on SOFR that is selected by the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System. The\ntransition to a successor rate may result in\n(i) increased volatility or illiquidity in\nmarkets for instruments or contracts that\ncurrently rely on LIBOR, (ii) a reduction in\nthe value of certain instruments or contracts\nheld by a Fund, (iii) reduced effectiveness of\nrelated Fund transactions, such as hedging,\n(iv) additional tax, accounting and regulatory\nrisks, or (v) costs incurred in connection\nwith closing out positions and entering into\nnew trades. Any pricing adjustments to a\nFund's investments resulting from a substitute\nreference rate may also adversely affect a\nFund's performance and/or NAV. Additionally,\nif LIBOR ultimately ceases to exist, a Fund\nmay need to renegotiate the credit agreements\nextending beyond the LIBOR phase out date with\na Fund's obligors that utilize LIBOR as a\nfactor in determining the interest rate and\ncertain of a Fund's existing credit facilities\nto replace LIBOR with a new rate. Any pricing\nadjustments to a Fund's investments resulting\nfrom a substitute reference rate may also\nadversely affect a Fund's performance and/or\nNAV. There is no assurance that the\ncomposition or characteristics of any such\nalternative reference rate will be similar to\nor produce the same value or economic\nequivalence as LIBOR or that instruments or\ncontracts using an alternative rate will have\nthe same volume or liquidity. MARKET\nTURBULENCE RESULTING FROM COVID-19 An outbreak\nof a respiratory disease caused by a novel\ncoronavirus (known as COVID-19) first detected\nin China in December 2019 has spread globally.\nIn an organized attempt to contain and\nmitigate the effects of the spread of\nCOVID-19, governments and businesses world-\nwide took and may continue to take aggressive\nmeasures, including closing borders,\nrestricting international and domestic travel,\nand the imposition of prolonged quarantines of\nlarge populations. COVID-19 has resulted in\nand may continue to result in the disruption\nof and delays in the delivery of healthcare\nservices and processes, the cancellation of\norganized events and educational institutions,\nthe disruption of production and supply\nchains, a decline in consumer demand for\ncertain goods and services, and general\nconcern and uncertainty, all of which have\ncontributed to increased volatility in global\nmarkets. The effects of COVID-19 will likely\naffect certain sectors and industries more\ndramatically than others, which may adversely\naffect the value of a Fund's investments in\nthose sectors or industries. COVID-19, and\nother epidemics and pandemics that may arise\nin the future, could adversely affect the\neconomies of many nations, the global economy,\nindividual companies and capital markets in\nways that cannot be foreseen at the present\ntime. In addition, the impact of infectious\ndiseases in developing or emerging market\ncountries may be greater due to limited health\ncare resources. Political, economic and social\nstresses caused by COVID-19 also may\nexacerbate other pre-existing political,\nsocial and economic risks in certain\ncountries. The duration of COVID-19 and its\neffects cannot be determined at this time, but\nthe effects could be present for an extended\nperiod of time. RUSSIA SANCTIONS RISK\nSanctions threatened or imposed by a number of\njurisdictions, including the United States,\nthe European Union and the United Kingdom, and\nother intergovernmental actions that have been\nor may be undertaken in the future, against\nRussia, Russian entities or Russian\nindividuals, may result in the devaluation of\nRussian currency, a downgrade in the country's\ncredit rating, an immediate freeze of Russian\nassets, a decline in the value and liquidity\nof Russian securities, property or interests,\nand/or other adverse consequences to the\nRussian economy or a Fund. The scope and scale\nof sanctions in place at a particular time may\nbe expanded or otherwise modified in a way\nthat have negative effects on a Fund.\nSanctions, or the threat of new or modified\nsanctions, could impair the ability of a Fund\nto buy, sell, hold, receive, deliver or\notherwise transact in certain affected\nsecurities or other investment instruments.\nSanctions could also result in Russia taking\ncounter measures or other actions in response,\nwhich may further impair the value and\nliquidity of Russian securities. These\nsanctions, and the resulting disruption of the\nRussian economy, may cause volatility in other\nregional and global markets and may negatively\nimpact the performance of various sectors and\nindustries, as well as companies in other\ncountries, which could have a negative effect\non the performance of a Fund, even if a Fund\ndoes not have direct exposure to securities of\nRussian issuers. As a collective result of the\nimposition of sanctions, Russian government\ncountermeasures and the impact that they have\nhad on the trading markets for Russian\nsecurities, certain Funds have used, and may\nin the future use, fair valuation procedures\napproved by the Fund's Board to value certain\nRussian securities, which could result in such\nsecurities being deemed to have a zero value.\n\n25\n\nA reduction in liquidity of certain Fund\nholdings as a result of sanctions and related\nactions may cause a Fund to experience\nincreased premiums or discounts to its NAV\nand/or wider bid-ask spreads. Additionally, if\nit becomes impracticable or unlawful for a\nFund to hold securities subject to, or\notherwise affected by, sanctions, or if deemed\nappropriate by the Fund's investment adviser,\nthe Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the\naffected securities in connection with\ncreation transactions and instead require a\ncash deposit, which may also increase the\nFund's transaction costs. TAX RISKS As with\nany investment, you should consider how your\ninvestment in Shares of a Fund will be taxed.\nThe tax information in the Prospectus and this\nSAI is provided as general information. You\nshould consult your own tax professional about\nthe tax consequences of an investment in\nShares of a Fund. Unless your investment in\nShares is made through a tax-exempt entity or\ntax-advantaged retirement account, such as an\nindividual retirement account, you need to be\naware of the possible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or you sell Shares.\nInvestment Restrictions The Trust has adopted\nthe following investment restrictions as\nfundamental policies with respect to each\nFund. These restrictions cannot be changed\nwithout the approval of the holders of a\nmajority of a Fund's outstanding voting\nsecurities. For purposes of the 1940 Act, a\nmajority of the outstanding voting securities\nof a Fund means the vote, at an annual or a\nspecial meeting of the security holders of the\nTrust, of the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the\nvoting securities of the Fund present at such\nmeeting, if the holders of more than 50% of\nthe outstanding voting securities of the Fund\nare present or represented by proxy, or (2)\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund. Except with the\napproval of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities, each Fund may not: 1.\nConcentrate its investments in securities of\nissuers in the same industry, except as may be\nnecessary to approximate the composition of\nthe Fund's underlying Index; (1) 2. Make loans\nto another person except as permitted by the\n1940 Act or other governing statute, by the\nRules thereunder, or by the SEC or other\nregulatory agency with authority over the\nFund; 3. Issue senior securities or borrow\nmoney except as permitted by the 1940 Act or\nother governing statute, by the Rules\nthereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory\nagency with authority over the Fund; 4. Invest\ndirectly in real estate unless the real estate\nis acquired as a result of ownership of\nsecurities or other instruments. This\nrestriction shall not preclude the Fund from\ninvesting in companies that deal in real\nestate or in instruments that are backed or\nsecured by real estate; 5. Act as an\nunderwriter of another issuer's securities,\nexcept to the extent the Fund may be deemed to\nbe an underwriter within the meaning of the\nSecurities Act in connection with the Fund's\npurchase and sale of portfolio securities; or\n6. Invest in commodities except as permitted\nby the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by\nthe Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other\nregulatory agency with authority over the\nFund. In addition to the investment\nrestrictions adopted as fundamental policies\nas set forth above, each Fund observes the\nfollowing restrictions, which may be changed\nby the Board without a shareholder vote. Each\nFund will not: 1. Invest in the securities of\na company for the purpose of exercising\nmanagement or control, provided that the Trust\nmay vote the investment securities owned by\nthe Fund in accordance with its views; or 2.\nWith respect to each Fund, under normal\ncircumstances, invest less than 80% of its\ntotal assets in securities that comprise its\nrelevant Index. Securities that have economic\ncharacteristics substantially identical to the\neconomic characteristics of the securities\nthat comprise the Index are included within\nthis 80% investment policy.\n\n(1) The SEC Staff considers concentration to\ninvolve more than 25% of a fund's assets to be\ninvested in an industry or group of\nindustries.\n\n26\n\n3. With respect to the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging\nMarkets Local Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE\nInternational Government Inflation-Protected\nBond ETF, under normal circumstances, invest\nless than 80% of its net assets, plus the\namount of borrowings for investment purposes,\nin debt securities. Prior to any change in a\nFund's 80% investment policy, the Fund will\nprovide shareholders with 60 days written\nnotice. 4. With respect to the SPDR Bloomberg\nInternational Corporate Bond ETF, invest,\nunder normal circumstances, less than 80% of\nits net assets, plus the amount of borrowings\nfor investment purposes, in corporate bonds.\nPrior to any change in this 80% investment\npolicy, the Fund will provide shareholders\nwith 60 days written notice. 5. With respect\nto the SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury\nBond ETF and SPDR Bloomberg Short Term\nInternational Treasury Bond ETF, under normal\ncircumstances, invest less than 80% of its net\nassets, plus the amount of borrowings for\ninvestment purposes, in government bonds.\nPrior to any change in the Fund's 80%\ninvestment policy, the Fund will provide\nshareholders with 60 days written notice. The\nFunds define the foregoing terms in accordance\nwith the definition of such terms per the\napplicable Index. If a percentage limitation\nis adhered to at the time of investment or\ncontract, a later increase or decrease in\npercentage resulting from any change in value\nor total or net assets will not result in a\nviolation of such restriction, except that the\npercentage limitations with respect to the\nborrowing of money will be observed\ncontinuously. With respect to the limitation\non borrowing, in the event that a subsequent\nchange in net assets or other circumstances\ncause a Fund to exceed its limitation, the\nFund will take steps to bring the aggregate\namount of borrowing back within the\nlimitations within three days thereafter (not\nincluding Sundays and holidays). The 1940 Act\ncurrently permits each Fund to loan up to 33\n1/3% of its total assets. With respect to\nborrowing, the 1940 Act presently allows each\nFund to: (1) borrow from any bank (including\npledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets)\nin an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total\nassets, (2) borrow money for temporary\npurposes in an amount not exceeding 5% of the\nvalue of the Fund's total assets at the time\nof the loan, and (3) enter into reverse\nrepurchase agreements. However, under normal\ncircumstances any borrowings by a Fund will\nnot exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. The\n1940 Act generally prohibits funds from\nissuing senior securities, although it does\nnot treat certain transactions as senior\nsecurities, such as certain borrowings, with\nappropriate asset coverage. With respect to\ninvestments in commodities, the 1940 Act\npresently permits the Funds to invest in\ncommodities in accordance with investment\npolicies contained in its prospectus and SAI.\nAny such investment shall also comply with the\nCEA and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe 1940 Act does not directly restrict an\ninvestment company's ability to invest in real\nestate, but does require that every investment\ncompany have the fundamental investment policy\ngoverning such investments. The Funds will not\npurchase or sell real estate, except that a\nFund may invest in companies that deal in real\nestate (including REITs) or in instruments\nthat are backed or secured by real estate.\nExchange Listing and Trading A discussion of\nexchange listing and trading matters\nassociated with an investment in a Fund is\ncontained in the Prospectus under \u201c PURCHASE\nAND SALE INFORMATION \u201d and \u201c ADDITIONAL\nPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d The\ndiscussion below supplements, and should be\nread in conjunction with, such sections of the\nProspectus. The Shares of each Fund are\napproved for listing and trading on the\nExchange, subject to notice of issuance.\nShares trade on the Exchange at prices that\nmay differ to some degree from their net asset\nvalue. There can be no assurance that the\nrequirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of Shares of a Fund will\ncontinue to be met. The Exchange may consider\nthe suspension of trading in, and may initiate\ndelisting proceedings of, the Shares of a Fund\nunder any of the following circumstances: (i)\nif the Exchange becomes aware that the Fund is\nno longer eligible to operate in reliance on\nRule 6c-11 under the 1940 Act; (ii) if the\nFund no longer complies with the applicable\nlisting requirements set forth in the\nExchange's rules; (iii) if, following the\ninitial twelve-month period after commencement\nof trading on the Exchange of the Fund, there\nare fewer than 50 beneficial holders of the\nFund; or (iv) if such other event shall occur\nor condition exists which, in the opinion of\nthe Exchange, makes further dealings on the\nExchange inadvisable. The Exchange will remove\nthe Shares from listing and trading upon\ntermination of a Fund. The Trust reserves the\nright to adjust the Share price of a Fund in\nthe future to maintain convenient trading\nranges for investors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor's\nequity interest in the Fund. As in the case of\nother publicly traded securities, brokers'\ncommissions on transactions will be based on\nnegotiated commission rates at customary\nlevels.\n\n27\n\nThe base and trading currencies of each Fund\nis the U.S. dollar. The base currency is the\ncurrency in which a Fund's net asset value per\nShare is calculated and the trading currency\nis the currency in which Shares of a Fund are\nlisted and traded on the Exchange. Management\nof the Trust The following information\nsupplements and should be read in conjunction\nwith the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c\nMANAGEMENT. \u201d BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES The\nmanagement and affairs of the Trust and its\nseries, including the Funds described in this\nSAI, are overseen by the Trustees. The Board\nhas approved contracts, as described in this\nSAI, under which certain companies provide\nessential management services to the Trust.\nLike most mutual funds, the day-to-day\nbusiness of the Trust, including the\nmanagement of risk, is performed by third\nparty service providers, such as the Adviser,\nDistributor, Administrator, and Sub-\nAdministrator. The Trustees are responsible\nfor overseeing the Trust's service providers\nand, thus, have oversight responsibility with\nrespect to risk management performed by those\nservice providers. Risk management seeks to\nidentify and address risks, i.e ., events or\ncircumstances that could have material adverse\neffects on the business, operations,\nshareholder services, investment performance\nor reputation of the Funds. The Funds and\ntheir service providers employ a variety of\nprocesses, procedures and controls to identify\nvarious of those possible events or\ncircumstances, to lessen the probability of\ntheir occurrence and/or to mitigate the\neffects of such events or circumstances if\nthey do occur. Each service provider is\nresponsible for one or more discrete aspects\nof the Trust's business and, consequently, for\nmanaging the risks associated with that\nbusiness. The Board has emphasized to the\nFunds' service providers the importance of\nmaintaining vigorous risk management. The\nTrustees' role in risk oversight begins before\nthe inception of a Fund, at which time the\nFund's Adviser presents the Board with\ninformation concerning the investment\nobjectives, strategies and risks of the Fund,\nas well as proposed investment limitations for\nthe Fund. Additionally, the Fund's Adviser\nprovides the Board with an overview of, among\nother things, their investment philosophies,\nbrokerage practices and compliance\ninfrastructures. Thereafter, the Board\ncontinues its oversight function as various\npersonnel, including the Trust's Chief\nCompliance Officer, as well as personnel of\nthe Adviser and other service providers, such\nas the Fund's independent accountants, make\nperiodic reports to the Audit Committee or to\nthe Board with respect to various aspects of\nrisk management. The Board and the Audit\nCommittee oversee efforts by management and\nservice providers to manage risks to which a\nFund may be exposed. The Board is responsible\nfor overseeing the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided to the Funds by the\nAdviser and receives information about those\nservices at its regular meetings. In addition,\non an annual basis, in connection with its\nconsideration of whether to renew the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with the\nAdviser, the Board meets with the Adviser to\nreview such services. Among other things, the\nBoard regularly considers the Adviser's\nadherence to each Fund's investment\nrestrictions and compliance with various Fund\npolicies and procedures and with applicable\nsecurities regulations. The Board also reviews\ninformation about each Fund's investments. The\nTrust's Chief Compliance Officer reports\nregularly to the Board to review and discuss\ncompliance issues. At least annually, the\nTrust's Chief Compliance Officer provides the\nBoard with a report reviewing the adequacy and\neffectiveness of the Trust's policies and\nprocedures and those of its service providers,\nincluding the Adviser. The report addresses\nthe operation of the policies and procedures\nof the Trust and each service provider since\nthe date of the last report; any material\nchanges to the policies and procedures since\nthe date of the last report; any\nrecommendations for material changes to the\npolicies and procedures; and any material\ncompliance matters since the date of the last\nreport. The Board receives reports from the\nFunds' service providers regarding operational\nrisks and risks related to the valuation and\nliquidity of portfolio securities. Regular\nreports are made to the Board concerning\ninvestments for which market quotations are\nnot readily available. Annually, the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nreviews with the Audit Committee its audit of\neach Fund's financial statements, focusing on\nmajor areas of risk encountered by the Fund\nand noting any significant deficiencies or\nmaterial weaknesses in the Fund's internal\ncontrols. Additionally, in connection with its\noversight function, the Board oversees Fund\nmanagement's implementation of disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, which are designed to\nensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports\nwith the SEC are\n\n28\n\nrecorded, processed, summarized, and reported\nwithin the required time periods. The Board\nalso oversees the Trust's internal controls\nover financial reporting, which comprise\npolicies and procedures designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof the Trust's financial reporting and the\npreparation of the Trust's financial\nstatements. From their review of these reports\nand discussions with the Adviser, the Chief\nCompliance Officer, the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and other service\nproviders, the Board and the Audit Committee\nlearn in detail about the material risks of\nthe Funds, thereby facilitating a dialogue\nabout how management and service providers\nidentify and mitigate those risks. The Board\nrecognizes that not all risks that may affect\na Fund can be identified and/or quantified,\nthat it may not be practical or cost-effective\nto eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that\nit may be necessary to bear certain risks\n(such as investment-related risks) to achieve\na Fund's goals, and that the processes,\nprocedures and controls employed to address\ncertain risks may be limited in their\neffectiveness. Moreover, reports received by\nthe Trustees as to risk management matters are\ntypically summaries of the relevant\ninformation. Most of the Funds' investment\nmanagement and business affairs are carried\nout by or through a Fund's Adviser and other\nservice providers, each of which has an\nindependent interest in risk management but\nwhose policies and the methods by which one or\nmore risk management functions are carried out\nmay differ from the Funds' and each other's in\nthe setting of priorities, the resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. As a result of the foregoing and\nother factors, the Board's ability to monitor\nand manage risk, as a practical matter, is\nsubject to limitations. TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS\nThere are eight members of the Board of\nTrustees, six of whom are not interested\npersons of the Trust, as that term is defined\nin the 1940 Act ( \u201c Independent Trustees \u201d ).\nCarl Verboncoeur, an Independent Trustee,\nserves as Chairman of the Board. The Board has\ndetermined its leadership structure is\nappropriate given the specific characteristics\nand circumstances of the Trust. The Board made\nthis determination in consideration of, among\nother things, the fact that the Independent\nTrustees constitute a super-majority (75%) of\nthe Board, the fact that the chairperson of\neach Committee of the Board is an Independent\nTrustee, the amount of assets under management\nin the Trust, and the number of funds overseen\nby the Board. The Board also believes that its\nleadership structure facilitates the orderly\nand efficient flow of information to the\nIndependent Trustees from fund management. The\nBoard of Trustees has two standing committees:\nthe Audit Committee and Trustee Committee. The\nAudit Committee and Trustee Committee are each\nchaired by an Independent Trustee and composed\nof all of the Independent Trustees. Set forth\nbelow are the names, year of birth, position\nwith the Trust, length of term of office, and\nthe principal occupations during the last five\nyears and other directorships held of each of\nthe persons currently serving as a Trustee or\nOfficer of the Trust.

The portfolio\nmanagers listed above did not beneficially own\nany interests of any Fund as of December 31,\n2022. Conflicts of Interest. A portfolio\nmanager that has responsibility for managing\nmore than one account may be subject to\npotential conflicts of interest because he or\nshe is responsible for other accounts in\naddition to the Funds. Those conflicts could\ninclude preferential treatment of one account\nover others in terms of: (a) the portfolio\nmanager's execution of different investment\nstrategies for various accounts; or (b) the\nallocation of resources or of investment\nopportunities. Portfolio managers may manage\nnumerous accounts for multiple clients. These\naccounts may include registered investment\ncompanies, other types of pooled accounts\n(e.g., collective investment funds), and\nseparate accounts (i.e., accounts managed on\nbehalf of individuals or public or private\ninstitutions). Portfolio managers make\ninvestment decisions for each account based on\nthe investment objectives and policies and\nother relevant investment considerations\napplicable to that portfolio. A potential\nconflict of interest may arise as a result of\na portfolio manager's responsibility for\nmultiple accounts with similar investment\nguidelines. Under these circumstances, a\npotential investment may be suitable for more\nthan one of the portfolio manager's accounts,\nbut the quantity of the investment available\nfor purchase is less than the aggregate amount\nthe accounts would ideally devote to the\nopportunity. Similar conflicts may arise when\nmultiple accounts seek to dispose of the same\ninvestment. The portfolio managers may also\nmanage accounts whose objectives and policies\ndiffer from that of the Funds. These\ndifferences may be such that under certain\ncircumstances, trading activity appropriate\nfor one account managed by the portfolio\nmanager may have adverse consequences for\nanother account managed by the portfolio\nmanager. For example, an account may sell a\nsignificant position in a security, which\ncould cause the market price of that security\nto decrease, while a Fund maintained its\nposition in that security. A potential\nconflict may arise when the portfolio managers\nare responsible for accounts that have\ndifferent advisory fees\u2014 the difference in\nfees could create an incentive for the\nportfolio manager to favor one account over\nanother, for example, in terms of access to\ninvestment opportunities. This conflict may be\nheightened if an account is subject to a\nperformance-based fee, as applicable. Another\npotential conflict may arise when the\nportfolio manager has an investment in one or\nmore accounts that participate in transactions\nwith other accounts. His or her investment(s)\nmay create an incentive for the portfolio\nmanager to favor one account over another. The\nAdviser has adopted policies and procedures\nreasonably designed to address these potential\nmaterial conflicts. For instance, portfolio\nmanagers are normally responsible for all\naccounts within a certain investment\ndiscipline and do not, absent special\ncircumstances, differentiate among the various\naccounts when allocating resources.\nAdditionally, the Adviser and its advisory\naffiliates have processes and procedures for\nallocating investment opportunities among\nportfolios that are designed to provide a fair\nand equitable allocation. With respect to\nconflicts arising from personal investments,\nall employees, including portfolio managers,\nmust comply with personal trading controls\nestablished by each of the Adviser's and\nTrust's Code of Ethics. SSGA's culture is\ncomplemented and reinforced by a total rewards\nstrategy that is based on a pay for\nperformance philosophy which seeks to offer a\ncompetitive pay mix of base salary, benefits,\ncash incentives and deferred compensation.\nSalary is based on a number of factors,\nincluding external benchmarking data and\nmarket trends, and performance both at the\nbusiness and individual level. SSGA's Global\nHuman Resources department regularly\nparticipates in compensation surveys in order\nto provide SSGA with market-based compensation\ninformation that helps support individual pay\ndecisions.\n\n39\n\nAdditionally, subject to State Street and SSGA\nbusiness results, an incentive pool is\nallocated to SSGA to reward its employees. The\nsize of the incentive pool for most business\nunits is based on the firm's overall\nprofitability and other factors, including\nperformance against risk-related goals. For\nmost SSGA investment teams, SSGA recognizes\nand rewards performance by linking annual\nincentive decisions for investment teams to\nthe firm's or business unit's profitability\nand business unit investment performance over\na multi-year period. Incentive pool funding\nfor most active investment teams is driven in\npart by the post-tax investment performance of\nfund(s) managed by the team versus the return\nlevels of the benchmark index(es) of the\nfund(s) on a one-, three- and, in some cases,\nfive-year basis. For most active investment\nteams, a material portion of incentive\ncompensation for senior staff is deferred over\na four-year period into the SSGA Long-Term\nIncentive ( \u201c SSGA LTI \u201d ) program. For these\nteams, The SSGA LTI program indexes the\nperformance of these deferred awards against\nthe post-tax investment performance of fund(s)\nmanaged by the team. This is intended to align\nour investment team's compensation with client\ninterests, both through annual incentive\ncompensation awards and through the long-term\nvalue of deferred awards in the SSGA LTI\nprogram. For the index equity investment team,\nincentive pool funding is driven in part by\nthe post-tax 1 and 3-year tracking error of\nthe funds managed by the team against the\nbenchmark indexes of the funds. The\ndiscretionary allocation of the incentive pool\nto the business units within SSGA is\ninfluenced by market-based compensation data,\nas well as the overall performance of each\nbusiness unit. Individual compensation\ndecisions are made by the employee's manager,\nin conjunction with the senior management of\nthe employee's business unit. These decisions\nare based on the overall performance of the\nemployee and, as mentioned above, on the\nperformance of the firm and business unit.\nDepending on the job level, a portion of the\nannual incentive may be awarded in deferred\ncompensation, which may include cash and/or\nDeferred Stock Awards (State Street stock),\nwhich typically vest over a four-year period.\nThis helps to retain staff and further aligns\nSSGA employees' interests with SSGA clients'\nand shareholders' long-term interests. SSGA\nrecognizes and rewards outstanding performance\nby: \u2022 Promoting employee ownership to connect\nemployees directly to the company's success. \u2022\nUsing rewards to reinforce mission, vision,\nvalues and business strategy. \u2022 Seeking to\nrecognize and preserve the firm's unique\nculture and team orientation. \u2022 Providing all\nemployees the opportunity to share in the\nsuccess of SSGA.

THE DISTRIBUTOR State\nStreet Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC\nis the principal underwriter and Distributor\nof Shares. Its principal address is One Iron\nStreet, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. Investor\ninformation can be obtained by calling\n1-866-787-2257. The Distributor has entered\ninto a distribution agreement ( \u201c Distribution\nAgreement \u201d ) with the Trust pursuant to which\nit distributes Shares of each Fund. The\nDistribution Agreement will continue for two\nyears from its effective date and is renewable\nannually thereafter. Shares will be\ncontinuously offered for sale by the Trust\nthrough the Distributor only in Creation\nUnits, as described in the Prospectus and\nbelow under \u201c PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF\nCREATION UNITS. \u201d Shares in less than Creation\nUnits are not distributed by the Distributor.\nThe Distributor will deliver the Prospectus to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nand confirmations of acceptance furnished by\nit. The Distributor is a broker-dealer\nregistered under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (the \u201c Exchange Act \u201d )\nand a member of the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority ( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The\nDistributor has no role in determining the\ninvestment policies of the Trust or which\nsecurities are to be purchased or sold by the\nTrust. An affiliate of the Distributor may\nassist Authorized Participants (as defined\nbelow) in assembling shares to purchase\nCreation Units or upon redemption, for which\nit may receive commissions or other fees from\nsuch Authorized Participants. An affiliate of\nthe Distributor also receives compensation\nfrom State Street for providing on-line\ncreation and redemption functionality to\nAuthorized Participants through its Fund\nConnect application. The Adviser or\nDistributor, or an affiliate of the Adviser or\nDistributor, may directly or indirectly make\ncash payments to certain broker-dealers for\nparticipating in activities that are designed\nto make registered representatives and other\nprofessionals more knowledgeable about\nexchange-traded products, including the SPDR\nfunds, or for other activities, such as\nparticipation in marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems.\n\n42\n\nIn addition, as of the date of this SAI, the\nAdviser and/or Distributor had arrangements\nwhereby they may make payments, other than for\nthe educational programs and marketing\nactivities described above, to Pershing LLC (\n\u201c Pershing \u201d ), RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( \u201c\nRBC \u201d ), LPL Financial, LLC ( \u201c LPL \u201d ), and\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management, LLC. These\namounts, which may be significant, are paid by\nthe Adviser and/or Distributor from their own\nresources and not from Fund assets. Pursuant\nto these arrangements, Pershing, RBC and LPL\nhave agreed to offer certain SPDR funds to\ntheir customers and not to charge certain of\ntheir customers any commissions when those\ncustomers purchase or sell shares of certain\nSPDR funds. Payments to a broker-dealer or\nintermediary may create potential conflicts of\ninterest between the broker dealer or\nintermediary and its clients. In addition, the\nAdviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of the\nAdviser or Distributor, as well as an index\nprovider that is not affiliated with the\nAdviser or Distributor, may reimburse expenses\nor make payments from their own assets to\nother persons in consideration of services,\nprovision of data, or other activities that\nthey believe may benefit the SPDR business or\nfacilitate investment in SPDR funds. The\nDistribution Agreement provides that it may be\nterminated at any time, without the payment of\nany penalty, as to a Fund: (i) by vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees or (ii)\nby vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the outstanding voting securities of\nthe Fund, on at least 60 days' written notice\nto the Distributor. The Distribution Agreement\nis also terminable upon 60 days' notice by the\nDistributor and will terminate automatically\nin the event of its assignment (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act). The continuation of the\nDistribution Agreement and any other related\nagreements is subject to annual approval of\nthe Board, including by a majority of the\nIndependent Trustees, as described above. The\nallocation among the Trust's series of fees\nand expenses payable under the Distribution\nAgreement will be made pro rata in accordance\nwith the daily net assets of the respective\nseries. The Distributor may also enter into\nagreements with securities dealers ( \u201c\nSoliciting Dealers \u201d ) who will solicit\npurchases of Creation Unit aggregations of\nShares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be\nParticipating Parties (as defined in the \u201c\nBook Entry Only System \u201d section below) and/or\nDTC Participants (as defined below). Pursuant\nto the Distribution Agreement, the Trust has\nagreed to indemnify the Distributor, and may\nindemnify Soliciting Dealers and Authorized\nParticipants (as described below) entering\ninto agreements with the Distributor, for\ncertain liabilities, including certain\nliabilities arising under the federal\nsecurities laws, unless such loss or liability\nresults from willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence in the performance of its\nduties or the reckless disregard of its\nobligations and duties under the Distribution\nAgreement or other agreement, as applicable.\nBrokerage Transactions All portfolio\ntransactions are placed on behalf of the Funds\nby the Adviser. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities on a securities exchange are\naffected through brokers who charge a\ncommission for their services. Ordinarily\ncommissions are not charged on over-the-\ncounter orders (e.g., fixed income securities)\nbecause the Funds pay a spread which is\nincluded in the cost of the security and\nrepresents the difference between the dealer's\nquoted price at which it is willing to sell\nthe security and the dealer's quoted price at\nwhich it is willing to buy the security. When\na Fund executes an over-the-counter order with\nan electronic communications network or an\nalternative trading system, a commission is\ncharged by such electronic communications\nnetworks and alternative trading systems as\nthey execute such orders on an agency basis.\nSecurities may be purchased from underwriters\nat prices that include underwriting fees. In\nplacing a portfolio transaction, the Adviser\nseeks to achieve best execution. The Adviser's\nduty to seek best execution requires the\nAdviser to take reasonable steps to obtain for\nthe client as favorable an overall result as\npossible for Fund portfolio transactions under\nthe circumstances, taking into account various\nfactors that are relevant to the particular\ntransaction. The Adviser refers to and selects\nfrom the list of approved trading\ncounterparties maintained by the Adviser's\nCredit Risk Management team. In selecting a\ntrading counterparty for a particular trade,\nthe Adviser seeks to weigh relevant factors\nincluding, but not limited to the following: \u2022\nPrompt and reliable execution; \u2022 The\ncompetitiveness of commission rates and\nspreads, if applicable; \u2022 The financial\nstrength, stability and/or reputation of the\ntrading counterparty;\n\n43\n\n\u2022 The willingness and ability of the executing\ntrading counterparty to execute transactions\n(and commit capital) of size in liquid and\nilliquid markets without disrupting the market\nfor the security; \u2022 Local laws, regulations or\nrestrictions; \u2022 The ability of the trading\ncounterparty to maintain confidentiality; \u2022\nThe availability and capability of execution\nvenues, including electronic communications\nnetworks for trading and execution management\nsystems made available to Adviser; \u2022 Market\nshare; \u2022 Liquidity; \u2022 Price; \u2022 Execution\nrelated costs; \u2022 History of execution of\norders; \u2022 Likelihood of execution and\nsettlement; \u2022 Order size and nature; \u2022\nClearance and settlement capabilities,\nespecially in high volatility market\nenvironments; \u2022 Availability of lendable\nsecurities; \u2022 Sophistication of the trading\ncounterparty's trading capabilities and\ninfrastructure/facilities; \u2022 The operational\nefficiency with which transactions are\nprocessed and cleared, taking into account the\norder size and complexity; \u2022 Speed and\nresponsiveness to the Adviser; \u2022 Access to\nsecondary markets; \u2022 Counterparty exposure;\nand \u2022 Depending upon the circumstances, the\nAdviser may take other relevant factors into\naccount if the Adviser believes that these are\nimportant in taking all sufficient steps to\nobtain the best possible result for execution\nof the order. In selecting a trading\ncounterparty, the price of the transaction and\ncosts related to the execution of the\ntransaction typically merit a high relative\nimportance, depending on the circumstances.\nThe Adviser does not necessarily select a\ntrading counterparty based upon price and\ncosts but may take other relevant factors into\naccount if it believes that these are\nimportant in taking reasonable steps to obtain\nthe best possible result for a Fund under the\ncircumstances. Consequently, the Adviser may\ncause a client to pay a trading counterparty\nmore than another trading counterparty might\nhave charged for the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value and quality of the\nbrokerage services provided. The following\nmatters may influence the relative importance\nthat the Adviser places upon the relevant\nfactors: (i) The nature and characteristics of\nthe order or transaction. For example, size of\norder, market impact of order, limits, or\nother instructions relating to the order; (ii)\nThe characteristics of the financial\ninstrument(s) or other assets which are the\nsubject of that order. For example, whether\nthe order pertains to an equity, fixed income,\nderivative or convertible instrument; (iii)\nThe characteristics of the execution venues to\nwhich that order can be directed, if relevant.\nFor example, availability and capabilities of\nelectronic trading systems; (iv) Whether the\ntransaction is a \u2018delivery versus payment' or\n\u2018over-the-counter' transaction. The\ncreditworthiness of the trading counterparty,\nthe amount of existing exposure to a trading\ncounterparty and trading counterparty\nsettlement capabilities may be given a higher\nrelative importance in the case of \u2018over-the-\ncounter' transactions; and/or (v) Any other\ncircumstances that the Adviser believes are\nrelevant at the time. The process by which\ntrading counterparties are selected to effect\ntransactions is designed to exclude\nconsideration of the sales efforts conducted\nby broker-dealers in relation to the Funds.\nThe Adviser does not currently use the Funds'\nassets in connection with third-party soft\ndollar arrangements. While the Adviser does\nnot currently use \u201c soft \u201d or commission\ndollars paid by the Funds for the purchase of\nthird-party research, the Adviser reserves the\nright to do so in the future.\n\n44\n\nThe table below shows the aggregate dollar\namount of brokerage commissions paid by SPDR\nBloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF for\nthe past three fiscal years ended December 31.\nNone of the brokerage commissions paid were\npaid to affiliated brokers and the SPDR\nBloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF,\nSPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond\nETF, SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International\nTreasury Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International\nGovernment Inflation-Protected Bond ETF did\nnot pay any brokerage commissions.

As of December 31, 2022, the Funds did\nnot have any holdings in securities of Regular\nBroker-Dealers. Portfolio Turnover: Portfolio\nturnover may vary from year to year, as well\nas within a year. The Funds may experience\nhigher portfolio turnover when migrating to a\ndifferent benchmark index. High turnover rates\nare likely to result in comparatively greater\nbrokerage expenses or transaction costs. The\noverall reasonableness of brokerage\ncommissions and transaction costs is evaluated\nby the Adviser based upon its knowledge of\navailable information as to the general level\nof commissions and transaction costs paid by\nother institutional investors for comparable\nservices. Book Entry Only System The following\ninformation supplements and should be read in\nconjunction with the section in the Prospectus\nentitled \u201c ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION. \u201d The Depository Trust Company (\n\u201c DTC \u201d ) acts as securities depositary for\nthe Shares. Shares of each Fund are\nrepresented by securities registered in the\nname of DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., and\ndeposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. Except\nin the limited circumstance provided below,\ncertificates will not be issued for Shares.\nDTC, a limited-purpose trust company, was\ncreated to hold securities of its participants\n(the \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ) and to facilitate\nthe clearance and settlement of securities\ntransactions among the DTC Participants in\nsuch securities through electronic book-entry\nchanges in accounts of the DTC Participants,\nthereby eliminating the need for physical\nmovement of securities certificates. DTC\nParticipants include securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and certain other organizations,\nsome of whom (and/or their representatives)\nown DTC. More specifically, DTC is owned by a\nnumber of its DTC Participants and by the New\nYork Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) and FINRA.\nAccess to the DTC system is also available to\nothers such as banks, brokers, dealers and\ntrust companies that clear through or maintain\na custodial relationship with a DTC\nParticipant, either directly or indirectly\n(the \u201c Indirect Participants \u201d ). Beneficial\nownership of Shares is limited to DTC\nParticipants, Indirect Participants and\npersons holding interests through DTC\nParticipants and Indirect Participants.\nOwnership of beneficial interests in Shares\n(owners of such beneficial interests are\nreferred to herein as \u201c Beneficial Owners \u201d )\nis shown on, and the transfer of ownership is\neffected only through, records maintained by\nDTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on\nthe records of DTC Participants (with respect\nto Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of Shares. Conveyance of all\nnotices, statements and other communications\nto Beneficial Owners is effected as follows.\nPursuant to the Depositary Agreement between\nthe Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make\navailable to the Trust upon request and for a\nfee to be charged to the Trust a listing of\nthe Shares of each Fund held by each DTC\nParticipant. The Trust, either directly or\nthrough a third party service, shall inquire\nof each such DTC Participant as to the number\nof Beneficial Owners holding Shares, directly\nor indirectly, through such DTC Participant.\nThe Trust, either directly or through a third\nparty service, shall provide each such DTC\nParticipant with copies of such notice,\nstatement or other communication, in such\nform, number and at such place as such DTC\nParticipant may reasonably request, in order\nthat\n\n45\n\nsuch notice, statement or communication may be\ntransmitted by such DTC Participant, directly\nor indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In\naddition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC\nParticipant and/or third party service a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all Shares. DTC or its\nnominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants' accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in Shares of a Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of Shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspects of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nShares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may\ndetermine to discontinue providing its service\nwith respect to Shares at any time by giving\nreasonable notice to the Trust and discharging\nits responsibilities with respect thereto\nunder applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action\neither to find a replacement for DTC to\nperform its functions at a comparable cost or,\nif such a replacement is unavailable, to issue\nand deliver printed certificates representing\nownership of Shares, unless the Trust makes\nother arrangements with respect thereto\nsatisfactory to the Exchange.

The principal\nconsideration for creations and redemptions\nfor each Fund is in-kind, although this may be\nrevised at any time without notice. PURCHASE\n(CREATION) The Trust issues and sells Shares\nof each Fund only: in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Principal\nUnderwriter, without a sales load (but subject\nto transaction fees), at their NAV per share\nnext determined after receipt of an order, on\nany Business Day (as defined below), in proper\nform pursuant to the terms of the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement ( \u201c Participant\nAgreement \u201d ). A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect\nto a Fund is, generally, any day on which the\nNYSE is open for business, although the Funds\nwill also not be open for orders on Veterans\nDay and Columbus Day. FUND DEPOSIT The\nconsideration for purchase of a Creation Unit\nof a Fund generally consists of either (i) the\nDeposit Securities and the Cash Component\n(defined below), computed as described below\nor (ii) the cash value of the Deposit\nSecurities and the \u201c Cash Component, \u201d\ncomputed as described below. When accepting\npurchases of Creation Units for cash, a Fund\nmay incur additional costs associated with the\nacquisition of Deposit Securities that would\notherwise be provided by an in-kind purchaser.\n\n48\n\nTogether, the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, and the Cash Component\nconstitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d which\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent\ninvestment amount for a Creation Unit of a\nFund. The \u201c Cash Component, \u201d which may\ninclude a Dividend Equivalent Payment, is an\namount equal to the difference between the net\nasset value of the Shares (per Creation Unit)\nand the market value of the Deposit Securities\nor Deposit Cash, as applicable. The \u201c Dividend\nEquivalent Payment \u201d enables a Fund to make a\ncomplete distribution of dividends on the day\npreceding the next dividend payment date, and\nis an amount equal, on a per Creation Unit\nbasis, to the dividends on all the portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund ( \u201c Dividend Securities\n\u201d ) with ex-dividend dates within the\naccumulation period for such distribution (the\n\u201c Accumulation Period \u201d ), net of expenses and\nliabilities for such period, as if all of the\nDividend Securities had been held by the Fund\nfor the entire Accumulation Period. The\nAccumulation Period begins on the ex-dividend\ndate for each Fund and ends on the day\npreceding the next ex-dividend date. If the\nCash Component is a positive number (i.e., the\nnet asset value per Creation Unit exceeds the\nmarket value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash\nComponent shall be such positive amount. If\nthe Cash Component is a negative number (i.e.,\nthe net asset value per Creation Unit is less\nthan the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable),\nthe Cash Component shall be such negative\namount and the creator will be entitled to\nreceive cash in an amount equal to the Cash\nComponent. The Cash Component serves the\nfunction of compensating for any differences\nbetween the net asset value per Creation Unit\nand the market value of the Deposit Securities\nor Deposit Cash, as applicable. Computation of\nthe Cash Component excludes any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities, if applicable, which shall\nbe the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below). The Custodian,\nthrough NSCC, makes available on each Business\nDay, prior to the opening of business on the\nExchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern time),\nthe list of the names and the required number\nof shares of each Deposit Security or the\nrequired amount of Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, to be included in the current\nstandard Fund Deposit (based on information at\nthe end of the previous Business Day) for a\nFund. Such standard Fund Deposit is subject to\nany applicable adjustments as described below,\nin order to effect purchases of Creation Units\nof a Fund until such time as the next-\nannounced composition of the Deposit\nSecurities or the required amount of Deposit\nCash, as applicable, is made available. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Deposit\nSecurities or the amount of Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, required for a Fund Deposit for\neach Fund may be changed from time to time\nwith a view to the investment objective of the\nFund. Information regarding the Fund Deposit\nnecessary for the purchase of a Creation Unit\nis made available to Authorized Participants\nand other market participants seeking to\ntransact in Creation Unit aggregations. The\nTrust intends to require the substitution of\nan amount of cash (i.e., a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount) to replace any Deposit Security that\nis a TBA transaction. The amount of cash\ncontributed will be equivalent to the price of\nthe TBA transaction listed as a Deposit\nSecurity. As noted above, the Trust reserves\nthe right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of Deposit Cash to replace any\nDeposit Security, which shall be added to the\nCash Component, including, without limitation,\nin situations where the Deposit Security: (i)\nmay not be available in sufficient quantity\nfor delivery, (ii) may not be eligible for\ntransfer through the systems of DTC for\ncorporate securities and municipal securities\nor the Federal Reserve System for U.S.\nTreasury securities; (iii) may not be eligible\nfor trading by an Authorized Participant (as\ndefined below) or the investor for which it is\nacting; (iv) would be restricted under the\nsecurities laws or where the delivery of the\nDeposit Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in the disposition of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant\nbecoming restricted under the securities laws,\nor (v) in certain other situations\n(collectively, \u201c non-standard orders \u201d ). The\nTrust also reserves the right to: (i) permit\nor require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of Deposit Cash; and (ii)\ninclude or remove Deposit Securities from the\nbasket in anticipation of portfolio changes.\nThe adjustments described above will reflect\nchanges, known to the Adviser on the date of\nannouncement to be in effect by the time of\ndelivery of the Fund Deposit, in the\ncomposition of the subject Index being tracked\nby the relevant Fund or resulting from certain\ncorporate actions. PROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF\nCREATION UNITS To be eligible to place orders\nwith the Principal Underwriter, as facilitated\nvia the Transfer Agent, to purchase a Creation\nUnit of a Fund, an entity must be (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party \u201d , i.e., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC; or (ii) a DTC Participant (see \u201c Book\nEntry Only System \u201d ), and (except with\nrespect to the SPDR Bloomberg International\nTreasury Bond ETF and SPDR Bloomberg Short\nTerm International Treasury Bond ETF) must\nhave the ability to clear through the Federal\nReserve System. In addition, each\nParticipating Party or DTC Participant (each,\nan \u201c Authorized Participant \u201d ) must execute a\nParticipant Agreement that has been agreed to\nby the Principal Underwriter and the Transfer\nAgent, and that has been accepted by the\nTrust, with respect to purchases and\nredemptions of Creation\n\n49\n\nUnits. Each Authorized Participant will agree,\npursuant to the terms of a Participant\nAgreement, on behalf of itself or any investor\non whose behalf it will act, to certain\nconditions, including that it will pay to the\nTrust, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the\nCash Component together with the creation\ntransaction fee (described below) and any\nother applicable fees, taxes and additional\nvariable charge. All orders to purchase Shares\ndirectly from a Fund, including non-standard\norders, must be placed for one or more\nCreation Units and in the manner and by the\ntime set forth in the Participant Agreement\nand/or the applicable order form. The date on\nwhich an order to purchase Creation Units (or\nan order to redeem Creation Units, as set\nforth below) is received and accepted is\nreferred to as the \u201c Order Placement Date. \u201d\nAn Authorized Participant may require an\ninvestor to make certain representations or\nenter into agreements with respect to the\norder (e.g., to provide for payments of cash,\nwhen required). Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not have executed\na Participant Agreement and that, therefore,\norders to purchase Shares directly from a Fund\nin Creation Units have to be placed by the\ninvestor's broker through an Authorized\nParticipant that has executed a Participant\nAgreement. In such cases there may be\nadditional charges to such investor. At any\ngiven time, there may be only a limited number\nof broker-dealers that have executed a\nParticipant Agreement and only a small number\nof such Authorized Participants may have\ninternational capabilities. On days when the\nExchange or the bond markets close earlier\nthan normal, a Fund may require orders to\ncreate Creation Units to be placed earlier in\nthe day. In addition, if a market or markets\non which a Fund's investments are primarily\ntraded is closed, the Fund will also generally\nnot accept orders on such day(s). Orders must\nbe transmitted by an Authorized Participant by\ntelephone or other transmission method\nacceptable to the Distributor pursuant to\nprocedures set forth in the Participant\nAgreement and in accordance with the\napplicable order form. Those placing orders\nthrough an Authorized Participant should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe purchase order by the cut-off time.\nEconomic or market disruptions or changes, or\ntelephone or other communication failure may\nimpede the ability to reach the Distributor or\nan Authorized Participant. Fund Deposits must\nbe delivered by an Authorized Participant\nthrough the Federal Reserve System (for cash\nand U.S. government securities), or through\nDTC (for corporate securities and municipal\nsecurities), through a subcustody agent (for\nforeign securities) and/or through such other\narrangements allowed by the Trust or its\nagents. With respect to foreign Deposit\nSecurities, the Custodian shall cause the\nsubcustodian of a Fund to maintain an account\ninto which the Authorized Participant shall\ndeliver, on behalf of itself or the party on\nwhose behalf it is acting, such Deposit\nSecurities. Foreign Deposit Securities must be\ndelivered to an account maintained at the\napplicable local subcustodian. The Fund\nDeposit transfer must be ordered by the\nAuthorized Participant in a timely fashion so\nas to ensure the delivery of the requisite\nnumber of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash,\nas applicable, to the account of a Fund or its\nagents by no later than the Settlement Date.\nThe \u201c Settlement Date \u201d for a Fund is\ngenerally the second Business Day ( \u201c T+2 \u201d )\nafter the Order Placement Date. The Settlement\nDate for the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets\nLocal Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International\nGovernment Inflation-Protected Bond ETF is the\nthird Business Day ( \u201c T+3 \u201d ) after the Order\nPlacement Date. All questions as to the number\nof Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash to be\ndelivered, as applicable, and the validity,\nform and eligibility (including time of\nreceipt) for the deposit of any tendered\nsecurities or cash, as applicable, will be\ndetermined by the Trust, whose determination\nshall be final and binding. The amount of cash\nrepresented by the Cash Component must be\ntransferred directly to the Custodian through\nthe Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system\nin a timely manner so as to be received by the\nCustodian no later than the Settlement Date.\nIf the Cash Component and the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, are\nnot received in a timely manner by the\nSettlement Date, the creation order may be\ncancelled. Upon written notice to the\nDistributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the following Business Day using a\nFund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect\nthe then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery\nof Creation Units so created generally will\noccur no later than the second Business Day\nfollowing the day on which the purchase order\nis deemed received by the Distributor.\nDelivery of Creation Units will occur no later\nthan the third Business Day following the day\non which the purchase order is deemed received\nby the Distributor for the SPDR Bloomberg\nEmerging Markets Local Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE\nInternational Government Inflation-Protected\nBond ETF. The order shall be deemed to be\nreceived on the Business Day on which the\norder is placed provided that the order is\nplaced in proper form prior to the applicable\ncut-off time and the federal funds in the\nappropriate amount are deposited by 2:00 p.m.\nor 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions), with the Custodian on the\nSettlement Date. If the order is not placed in\nproper form as required, or federal funds in\nthe appropriate amount are not received by\n2:00 p.m. or 3:00\n\n50\n\np.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, then the\norder may be deemed to be rejected and the\nAuthorized Participant shall be liable to the\nFund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom.\nA creation request is considered to be in \u201c\nproper form \u201d if all procedures set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, order form and this\nSAI are properly followed. ISSUANCE OF A\nCREATION UNIT Except as provided herein,\nCreation Units will not be issued until the\ntransfer of good title to the Trust of the\nDeposit Securities or payment of Deposit Cash,\nas applicable, and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the\nsubcustodian has confirmed to the Custodian\nthat the required Deposit Securities (or the\ncash value thereof) have been delivered to the\naccount of the relevant subcustodian or\nsubcustodians, the Principal Underwriter and\nthe Adviser shall be notified of such\ndelivery, and the Trust will issue and cause\nthe delivery of the Creation Units. In\ninstances where the Trust accepts Deposit\nSecurities for the purchase of a Creation\nUnit, the Creation Unit may be purchased in\nadvance of receipt by the Trust of all or a\nportion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nas described below. In these circumstances,\nthe initial deposit will have a value greater\nthan the net asset value of the Shares on the\ndate the order is placed in proper form since\nin addition to available Deposit Securities,\ncash must be deposited in an amount equal to\nthe sum of (i) the Cash Component, plus (ii)\nan additional amount of cash equal to a\npercentage of the market value as set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, of the undelivered\nDeposit Securities (the \u201c Additional Cash\nDeposit \u201d ), which shall be maintained in a\ngeneral non-interest bearing collateral\naccount. An additional amount of cash shall be\nrequired to be deposited with the Trust,\npending delivery of the missing Deposit\nSecurities to the extent necessary to maintain\nthe Additional Cash Deposit with the Trust in\nan amount at least equal to the applicable\npercentage, as set forth in the Participant\nAgreement, of the daily marked to market value\nof the missing Deposit Securities. The Trust\nmay use such Additional Cash Deposit to buy\nthe missing Deposit Securities at any time.\nAuthorized Participants will be liable to the\nTrust for all costs, expenses, dividends,\nincome and taxes associated with missing\nDeposit Securities, including the costs\nincurred by the Trust in connection with any\nsuch purchases. These costs will be deemed to\ninclude the amount by which the actual\npurchase price of the Deposit Securities\nexceeds the market value of such Deposit\nSecurities on the day the purchase order was\ndeemed received by the Principal Underwriter\nplus the brokerage and related transaction\ncosts associated with such purchases. The\nTrust will return any unused portion of the\nAdditional Cash Deposit once all of the\nmissing Deposit Securities have been properly\nreceived by the Custodian or purchased by the\nTrust and deposited into the Trust. In\naddition, a transaction fee as set forth below\nunder \u201c Creation Transaction Fees \u201d will be\ncharged in all cases and an additional\nvariable charge may also be applied. The\ndelivery of Creation Units so created\ngenerally will occur no later than the\nSettlement Date. ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF\nCREATION UNITS The Trust reserves the right to\nreject an order for Creation Units transmitted\nin respect of a Fund at its discretion,\nincluding, without limitation, if (a) the\norder is not in proper form or the Deposit\nSecurities delivered do not consist of the\nsecurities that the Custodian specified; (b)\nthe Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, delivered by the Authorized\nParticipant are not as disseminated through\nthe facilities of the NSCC for that date by\nthe Custodian; (c) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the Shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding Shares of\nthe Fund; (d) the acceptance of the Fund\nDeposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be\nunlawful; (e) the acceptance or receipt of the\norder for a Creation Unit would, in the\nopinion of counsel to the Trust, be unlawful;\nor (f) in the event that circumstances outside\nthe control of the Trust, the Custodian, the\nTransfer Agent, the Distributor and/or the\nAdviser make it for all practical purposes not\nfeasible to process orders for Creation Units.\nExamples of such circumstances include acts of\nGod or public service or utility problems such\nas fires, floods, extreme weather conditions\nand power outages resulting in telephone,\ntelecopy and computer failures; market\nconditions or activities causing trading\nhalts; systems failures involving computer or\nother information systems affecting the Trust,\nthe Principal Underwriter, the Custodian, the\nTransfer Agent, DTC, NSCC, Federal Reserve\nSystem, or any other participant in the\ncreation process, and other extraordinary\nevents. The Trust or its agents shall\ncommunicate to the Authorized Participant its\nrejection of an order. The Trust, the Transfer\nAgent, the Custodian and the Principal\nUnderwriter are under no duty, however, to\ngive notification of any defects or\nirregularities in the delivery of Fund\nDeposits nor shall either of them incur any\nliability for the failure to give any such\nnotification. The Trust, the Transfer Agent,\nthe Custodian and the Principal Underwriter\nshall not be liable for the rejection of any\npurchase order for Creation Units. Given the\nimportance of the ongoing issuance of Creation\nUnits to maintaining a market price that is at\nor close to the underlying net asset value of\na Fund, the Trust does not intend to suspend\nacceptance of orders for Creation Units.\n\n51\n\nAll questions as to the number of shares of\neach security in the Deposit Securities and\nthe validity, form, eligibility and acceptance\nfor deposit of any securities to be delivered\nshall be determined by the Trust, and the\nTrust's determination shall be final and\nbinding. REDEMPTION Shares may be redeemed\nonly in Creation Units at their net asset\nvalue next determined after receipt of a\nredemption request in proper form by a Fund\nthrough the Transfer Agent and only on a\nBusiness Day. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF A\nFUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN\nAMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION UNITS. Investors\nmust accumulate enough Shares in the secondary\nmarket to constitute a Creation Unit in order\nto have such Shares redeemed by the Trust.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that there\nwill be sufficient liquidity in the public\ntrading market at any time to permit assembly\nof a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to\nincur brokerage and other costs in connection\nwith assembling a sufficient number of Shares\nto constitute a redeemable Creation Unit. With\nrespect to each Fund, the Custodian, through\nthe NSCC, makes available prior to the opening\nof business on the Exchange (currently 9:30\na.m. Eastern time) on each Business Day, the\nlist of the names and share quantities of\nsecurities designated by the Fund that will be\napplicable (subject to possible amendment or\ncorrection) to redemption requests received in\nproper form (as defined below) on that day ( \u201c\nRedemption Securities \u201d ). Redemption\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit Securities. The identity\nand number of shares of the Redemption\nSecurities or the Cash Redemption Amount\n(defined below) may be changed from time to\ntime with a view to the investment objective\nof a Fund. Redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit are paid either in-kind or in cash, or a\ncombination thereof, as determined by the\nTrust. With respect to in-kind redemptions of\na Fund, redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit will consist of Redemption Securities\nplus cash in an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the net asset value of the Fund Shares\nbeing redeemed, as next determined after a\nreceipt of a request in proper form, and the\nvalue of the Redemption Securities (the \u201c Cash\nRedemption Amount \u201d ), less a fixed redemption\ntransaction fee and any applicable additional\nvariable charge as set forth below. In the\nevent that the Redemption Securities have a\nvalue greater than the net asset value of the\nFund Shares, a compensating cash payment equal\nto the differential is required to be made by\nor through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, at the Trust's discretion, an\nAuthorized Participant may receive the\ncorresponding cash value of the securities in\nlieu of the in-kind securities value\nrepresenting one or more Redemption\nSecurities. PROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF\nCREATION UNITS After the Trust has deemed an\norder for redemption received, the Trust will\ninitiate procedures to transfer the requisite\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to the Authorized Participant by the\nSettlement Date. With respect to in-kind\nredemptions of a Fund, the calculation of the\nvalue of the Redemption Securities and the\nCash Redemption Amount to be delivered upon\nredemption will be made by the Custodian\naccording to the procedures set forth under \u201c\nDetermination of Net Asset Value \u201d , computed\non the Business Day on which a redemption\norder is deemed received by the Trust.\nTherefore, if a redemption order in proper\nform is submitted to the Principal Underwriter\nby a DTC Participant by the specified time on\nthe Order Placement Date, and the requisite\nnumber of Shares of a Fund are delivered to\nthe Custodian prior to 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions) on\nthe Settlement Date, then the value of the\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to be delivered will be determined by\nthe Custodian on such Order Placement Date. If\nthe requisite number of Shares of the Fund are\nnot delivered by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions) on\nthe Settlement Date, the Fund will not release\nthe underlying securities for delivery unless\ncollateral is posted in such percentage amount\nof missing Shares as set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement (marked to market\ndaily). With respect to in-kind redemptions of\na Fund, in connection with taking delivery of\nshares of Redemption Securities upon\nredemption of Creation Units, an Authorized\nParticipant must maintain appropriate custody\narrangements with a qualified broker-dealer,\nbank or other custody providers in each\njurisdiction in which any of the Redemption\nSecurities are customarily traded (or such\nother arrangements as allowed by the Trust or\nits agents), to which account such Redemption\nSecurities will be delivered. Deliveries of\nredemption proceeds generally will be made\nwithin two Business Days, or in the case of\nthe SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond\nETF and SPDR FTSE International Government\nInflation-Protected Bond ETF within three\nBusiness Days, of the trade date.\n\n52\n\nDue to the schedule of holidays in certain\ncountries, however, the delivery of in-kind\nredemption proceeds may take longer than two\nor three Business Days, as applicable, after\nthe day on which the redemption request is\nreceived in proper form. If the Authorized\nParticipant has not made appropriate\narrangements to take delivery of the\nRedemption Securities in the applicable\nforeign jurisdiction and it is not possible to\nmake other such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of the\nRedemption Securities in such jurisdiction,\nthe Trust may, in its discretion, exercise its\noption to redeem such Shares in cash, and the\nAuthorized Participant will be required to\nreceive its redemption proceeds in cash. If it\nis not possible to make other such\narrangements, or if it is not possible to\neffect deliveries of the Redemption\nSecurities, the Trust may in its discretion\nexercise its option to redeem such Shares in\ncash, and the redeeming investor will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in\ncash. In addition, an investor may request a\nredemption in cash that a Fund may, in its\nsole discretion, permit. In either case, the\ninvestor will receive a cash payment equal to\nthe NAV of its Shares based on the NAV of\nShares of the relevant Fund next determined\nafter the redemption request is received in\nproper form (minus a redemption transaction\nfee and additional charge for requested cash\nredemptions specified above, to offset the\nTrust's brokerage and other transaction costs\nassociated with the disposition of Redemption\nSecurities). A Fund may also, in its sole\ndiscretion, upon request of a shareholder,\nprovide such redeemer a portfolio of\nsecurities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Redemption Securities but\ndoes not differ in net asset value. An\nAuthorized Participant submitting a redemption\nrequest is deemed to represent to the Trust\nthat, as of the close of the Business Day on\nwhich the redemption request was submitted, it\n(or its client) will own (within the meaning\nof Rule 200 of Regulation SHO) or has arranged\nto borrow for delivery to the Trust on or\nprior to the Settlement Date of the redemption\nrequest, the requisite number of Shares of the\nrelevant Fund to be redeemed as a Creation\nUnit. In either case, the Authorized\nParticipant is deemed to acknowledge that: (i)\nit (or its client) has full legal authority\nand legal right to tender for redemption the\nrequisite number of Shares of the applicable\nFund and to receive the entire proceeds of the\nredemption; and (ii) if such Shares submitted\nfor redemption have been loaned or pledged to\nanother party or are the subject of a\nrepurchase agreement, securities lending\nagreement or any other arrangement affecting\nlegal or beneficial ownership of such Shares\nbeing tendered, there are no restrictions\nprecluding the tender and delivery of such\nShares (including borrowed shares, if any) for\nredemption, free and clear of liens, on the\nredemption Settlement Date. The Trust reserves\nthe right to verify these representations at\nits discretion, but will typically require\nverification with respect to a redemption\nrequest from a Fund in connection with higher\nlevels of redemption activity and/or short\ninterest in the Fund. If the Authorized\nParticipant, upon receipt of a verification\nrequest, does not provide sufficient\nverification of its representations as\ndetermined by the Trust, the redemption\nrequest will not be considered to have been\nreceived in proper form and may be rejected by\nthe Trust. Redemptions of Shares for\nRedemption Securities will be subject to\ncompliance with applicable federal and state\nsecurities laws and each Fund (whether or not\nit otherwise permits cash redemptions)\nreserves the right to redeem Creation Units\nfor cash to the extent that the Trust could\nnot lawfully deliver specific Redemption\nSecurities upon redemptions or could not do so\nwithout first registering the Redemption\nSecurities under such laws. An Authorized\nParticipant or an investor for which it is\nacting subject to a legal restriction with\nrespect to a particular security included in\nthe Redemption Securities applicable to the\nredemption of Creation Units may be paid an\nequivalent amount of cash. The Authorized\nParticipant may request the redeeming investor\nof the Shares to complete an order form or to\nenter into agreements with respect to such\nmatters as compensating cash payment. Further,\nan Authorized Participant that is not a \u201c\nqualified institutional buyer, \u201d ( \u201c QIB \u201d )\nas such term is defined under Rule 144A of the\nSecurities Act, will not be able to receive\nRedemption Securities that are restricted\nsecurities eligible for resale under Rule\n144A. An Authorized Participant may be\nrequired by the Trust to provide a written\nconfirmation with respect to QIB status in\norder to receive Redemption Securities. The\nright of redemption may be suspended or the\ndate of payment postponed with respect to a\nFund (1) for any period during which the\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (2) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Exchange is\nsuspended or restricted; (3) for any period\nduring which an emergency exists as a result\nof which disposal of the Shares of the Fund or\ndetermination of the NAV of the Shares is not\nreasonably practicable; or (4) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nREQUIRED EARLY ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS FOR\nCERTAIN INTERNATIONAL FUNDS Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, as described in the Participant\nAgreement and/or the applicable order form,\ncertain Funds may require orders to be placed\nprior to the trade date, as described in the\nParticipant Agreement or the applicable order\nform, in order to receive the trade date's net\nasset value. The cut-off time to receive the\ntrade date's net asset value will not precede\nthe calculation of the net asset value of a\nFund's shares on the prior Business Day.\nOrders to purchase\n\n53\n\nShares of such Funds that are submitted on the\nBusiness Day immediately preceding a holiday\nor a day (other than a weekend) that the\nequity markets in the relevant foreign market\nare closed may not be accepted. Authorized\nParticipants may be notified that the cut-off\ntime for an order may be earlier on a\nparticular Business Day, as described in the\nParticipant Agreement and the applicable order\nform. CREATION AND REDEMPTION TRANSACTION FEES\nA transaction fee, as set forth in the table\nbelow, is imposed for the transfer and other\ntransaction costs associated with the purchase\nor redemption of Creation Units, as\napplicable. Authorized Participants will be\nrequired to pay a fixed creation transaction\nfee and/or a fixed redemption transaction fee,\nas applicable, on a given day regardless of\nthe number of Creation Units created or\nredeemed on that day. A Fund may adjust the\ntransaction fee from time to time. An\nadditional charge or a variable charge\n(discussed below) will be applied to certain\ncreation and redemption transactions,\nincluding non-standard orders and whole or\npartial cash purchases or redemptions. With\nrespect to creation orders, Authorized\nParticipants are responsible for the costs of\ntransferring the securities constituting the\nDeposit Securities to the account of the Trust\nand with respect to redemption orders,\nAuthorized Participants are responsible for\nthe costs of transferring the Redemption\nSecurities from the Trust to their account or\non their order. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other such intermediary may\nalso be charged a fee for such services.\nCreation and Redemption Transaction Fees:\n                                              \n  Fund          TransactionF\u2026  MaximumTrans\u2026  \n  SPDR                                        \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  Emerging             $1,500         $6,000  \n  Markets                                     \n  Local Bond                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  SPDR                                        \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  Internation\u2026         $1,500         $6,000  \n  Corporate                                   \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  SPDR                                        \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  Internation\u2026         $1,500         $6,000  \n  Treasury                                    \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  SPDR                                        \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  Short Term           $1,500         $6,000  \n  Internation\u2026                                \n  Treasury                                    \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  SPDR FTSE                                   \n  Internation\u2026                                \n  Government           $1,500         $6,000  \n  Inflation-P\u2026                                \n  Bond ETF                                    \n                                              \n* From time to time, a Fund may waive all or a\nportion of its applicable transaction fee(s).\nAn additional charge of up to three (3) times\nthe standard transaction fee may be charged to\nthe extent a transaction is outside of the\nclearing process. ** In addition to the\ntransaction fees listed above, the Funds may\ncharge an additional variable fee for\ncreations and redemptions in cash to offset\nbrokerage and impact expenses associated with\nthe cash transaction. The variable transaction\nfee will be calculated based on historical\ntransaction cost data and the Adviser's view\nof current market conditions; however, the\nactual variable fee charged for a given\ntransaction may be lower or higher than the\ntrading expenses incurred by a Fund with\nrespect to that transaction. Determination of\nNet Asset Value The following information\nsupplements and should be read in conjunction\nwith the sections in the Prospectus entitled \u201c\nPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION \u201d and \u201c\nADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d\nNAV per Share for each Fund is computed by\ndividing the value of the net assets of the\nFund (i.e., the value of its total assets less\ntotal liabilities) by the total number of\nShares outstanding. Expenses and fees,\nincluding the management fees, are accrued\ndaily and taken into account for purposes of\ndetermining NAV. The NAV of each Fund is\ncalculated by State Street and determined once\ndaily as of the close of the regular trading\nsession on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m.\nEastern time) on each day that such exchange\nis open. Creation/redemption order cut-off\ntimes may be earlier on any day that the\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation (or applicable exchange or market\non which a Fund's investments are traded)\nannounces an early closing time. Any assets or\nliabilities denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S.\ndollars at market rates on the date of\nvaluation (generally as of 4:00 p.m. London\ntime) as quoted by one or more sources. In\ncalculating a Fund's net asset value per\nShare, the Fund's investments are generally\nvalued using market valuations. A market\nvaluation generally means a valuation (i)\nobtained from an exchange, a pricing service,\nor a major market maker (or dealer) or (ii)\nbased on a price quotation or other equivalent\nindication of value supplied by an exchange, a\npricing service, or a major market maker (or\ndealer). Each Fund relies on a third-party\nservice provider for assistance with the daily\ncalculation of the Fund's NAV. The third-party\nservice provider, in turn, relies on other\nparties for certain pricing data and other\ninputs used in the calculation of the Fund's\nNAV. Therefore, each Fund is subject to\ncertain operational risks associated with\nreliance on its service provider and that\nservice provider's sources of pricing and\nother data. NAV calculation may be adversely\naffected by operational risks arising from\nfactors such as errors or failures in systems\nand technology. Such errors or failures may\nresult in inaccurately calculated NAVs, delays\nin the calculation of NAVs and/or\n\n54\n\nthe inability to calculate NAV over extended\ntime periods. A Fund may be unable to recover\nany losses associated with such failures. In\nthe case of shares of other funds that are not\ntraded on an exchange, a market valuation\nmeans such fund's published net asset value\nper share. Each Fund may use various pricing\nservices, or discontinue the use of any\npricing service. Fixed-income assets are\ngenerally valued as of the announced closing\ntime for trading in fixed-income instruments\nin a particular market or exchange, and\ngenerally 4:00 p.m. EST for U.S. fixed-income\nassets. Fixed-income assets are generally\nvalued at the mean of the bid and ask prices\nfor bank loans and inflation protected\nsecurities, and at the bid price for all other\nfixed-income assets. Pursuant to Board\napproved valuation procedures, the Board has\ndesignated the Adviser as the valuation\ndesignee for each Fund. These procedures\naddress, among other things, (i) determining\n(a) when market quotations are not readily\navailable or reliable and (b) the\nmethodologies to be used for determining the\nfair value of investments, and (ii) the use\nand oversight of third-party pricing services\nfor fair valuation. The Adviser is responsible\nfor periodically reviewing the procedures, and\nthe selected methodologies used, for their\ncontinuing appropriateness and accuracy, and\nmaking any changes or adjustments to the\nprocedures and methodologies as appropriate.\nIn the event that current market valuations\nare not readily available or are deemed\nunreliable, the Trust's procedures require the\nAdviser to determine a security's fair value.\nIn determining a fair value, the Adviser may\nconsider, among other things, (i) price\ncomparisons among multiple sources, (ii) a\nreview of corporate actions and news events,\nand (iii) a review of relevant financial\nindicators (e.g., movement in interest rates,\nmarket indices, and prices from a Fund's Index\nprovider). In these cases, a Fund's net asset\nvalue may reflect certain portfolio\nsecurities' fair values rather than their\nmarket prices. The fair value of a portfolio\ninstrument is generally the price which a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive upon its\ncurrent sale in an orderly market between\nmarket participants. Ascertaining fair value\nrequires a determination of the amount that an\narm's-length buyer, under the circumstances,\nwould currently pay for the portfolio\ninstrument. Fair value pricing involves\nsubjective judgments and it is possible that\nthe fair value determination for a security is\nmaterially different than the value that could\nbe realized upon the sale of the security. In\naddition, fair value pricing could result in a\ndifference between the prices used to\ncalculate a Fund's net asset value and the\nprices used by the Index. This may result in a\ndifference between a Fund's performance and\nthe performance of the Index. Dividends and\nDistributions The following information\nsupplements and should be read in conjunction\nwith the section in each Prospectus entitled \u201c\nDISTRIBUTIONS. \u201d GENERAL POLICIES Dividends\nfrom net investment income, if any, are\ngenerally declared and paid monthly by each\nFund. Distributions of net realized securities\ngains, if any, generally are declared and paid\nonce a year, but the Trust may make\ndistributions on a more frequent basis for a\nFund to improve index tracking or to comply\nwith the distribution requirements of the\nInternal Revenue Code, in all events in a\nmanner consistent with the provisions of the\n1940 Act. Dividends and other distributions on\nShares are distributed, as described below, on\na pro rata basis to Beneficial Owners of such\nShares. Dividend payments are made through DTC\nParticipants and Indirect Participants to\nBeneficial Owners then of record with proceeds\nreceived from the Trust. Management of the\nTrust reserves the right to declare special\ndividends if, in its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or advisable to\npreserve a Fund's eligibility for treatment as\na RIC under the Internal Revenue Code or to\navoid imposition of income or excise taxes at\nthe Fund level. DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT Broker\ndealers, at their own discretion, may offer a\ndividend reinvestment service under which\nShares are purchased in the secondary market\nat current market prices. Investors should\nconsult their broker dealer for further\ninformation regarding any dividend\nreinvestment service offered by such broker\ndealer.\n\n55\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nfederal income tax considerations generally\naffecting the Funds and their shareholders\nthat supplements the discussions in the\nProspectus. No attempt is made to present a\ncomprehensive explanation of the federal,\nstate, local or foreign tax treatment of the\nFunds or their shareholders, and the\ndiscussion here and in each Prospectus is not\nintended to be a substitute for careful tax\nplanning. The following general discussion of\ncertain federal income tax consequences is\nbased on the Internal Revenue Code and the\nregulations issued thereunder as in effect on\nthe date of this SAI. New legislation, as well\nas administrative changes or court decisions,\nmay significantly change the conclusions\nexpressed herein, and may have a retroactive\neffect with respect to the transactions\ncontemplated herein. The following information\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled \u201c ADDITIONAL TAX\nINFORMATION. \u201d TAXATION OF THE FUNDS Each Fund\nis treated as a separate corporation for\nfederal income tax purposes. A Fund therefore\nis considered to be a separate entity in\ndetermining its treatment under the rules for\nRICs described herein and in the Prospectus.\nLosses in one series of the Trust do not\noffset gains in any other series of the Trust\nand the requirements (other than certain\norganizational requirements) for qualifying\nfor treatment as a RIC are determined at the\nFund level rather than at the Trust level.\nEach Fund has elected or will elect and\nintends to qualify each year to be treated as\na separate RIC under Subchapter M of the\nInternal Revenue Code. As such, each Fund\nshould not be subject to federal income tax on\nits net investment income and capital gains,\nif any, to the extent that it timely\ndistributes such income and capital gains to\nits shareholders. In order to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC, a Fund must distribute\nannually to its shareholders at least the sum\nof 90% of its taxable net investment income\n(generally including the excess of net short-\nterm capital gains over net long-term capital\nlosses) and 90% of its net tax-exempt interest\nincome, if any (the \u201c Distribution Requirement\n\u201d ) and also must meet several additional\nrequirements. Among these requirements are the\nfollowing: (i) at least 90% of a Fund's gross\nincome each taxable year must be derived from\ndividends, interest, payments with respect to\ncertain securities loans, gains from the sale\nor other disposition of stock, securities or\nforeign currencies, or other income derived\nwith respect to its business of investing in\nsuch stock, securities or currencies, and net\nincome derived from interests in qualified\npublicly traded partnerships (the \u201c Qualifying\nIncome Requirement \u201d ); and (ii) at the end of\neach quarter of a Fund's taxable year, its\nassets must be diversified so that (a) at\nleast 50% of the market value of its total\nassets must be represented by cash and cash\nitems, U.S. government securities, securities\nof other RICs and other securities, with such\nother securities limited, in respect to any\none issuer, to an amount not greater in value\nthan 5% of the value of the Fund's total\nassets and to not more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of its\ntotal assets is invested in the securities\n(other than U.S. government securities or\nsecurities of other RICs) of any one issuer,\nthe securities (other than securities of other\nRICs) of two or more issuers that it controls\nand that are engaged in the same, similar, or\nrelated trades or businesses, or the\nsecurities of one or more qualified publicly\ntraded partnerships (the \u201c Diversification\nRequirement \u201d ). If a Fund fails to satisfy\nthe Qualifying Income Requirement or the\nDiversification Requirement in any taxable\nyear, the Fund may be eligible for relief\nprovisions if the failures are due to\nreasonable cause and not willful neglect and\nif a penalty tax is paid with respect to each\nfailure to satisfy the applicable\nrequirements. Additionally, relief is provided\nfor certain de minimis failures of the\nDiversification Requirement where the Fund\ncorrects the failure within a specified period\nof time. In order to be eligible for the\nrelief provisions with respect to a failure to\nmeet the Diversification Requirement, a Fund\nmay be required to dispose of certain assets.\nIf these relief provisions were not available\nto a Fund and it were to fail to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all of\nits taxable income would be subject to tax at\nthe applicable corporate rate without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand its distributions (including capital gains\ndistributions) generally would be taxable as\nordinary income dividends to its shareholders,\nsubject to the dividends-received deduction\nfor corporate shareholders and the lower tax\nrates on qualified dividend income received by\nnoncorporate shareholders. To requalify for\ntreatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable\nyear, the Fund would be required to satisfy\nthe RIC qualification requirements for that\nyear and to distribute any earnings and\nprofits from any year in which the Fund failed\nto qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. If a\nFund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period\ngreater than two taxable years, it would\ngenerally be required to pay a Fund-level tax\non certain net built-in gains recognized with\nrespect to certain of its assets upon a\ndisposition of such assets within five years\nof qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year.\nThe Board reserves the right not to maintain\nthe qualification of a Fund for treatment as a\nRIC if it determines such course of action to\nbe beneficial to shareholders.\n\n56\n\nAs discussed more fully below, each Fund\nintends to distribute substantially all of its\nnet investment income and its capital gains\nfor each taxable year. If a Fund meets the\nDistribution Requirement but retains some or\nall of its income or gains, it will be subject\nto federal income tax to the extent any such\nincome or gains are not distributed. A Fund\nmay designate certain amounts retained as\nundistributed net capital gain in a notice to\nits shareholders, who (i) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gain, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount so designated, (ii) will be entitled to\ncredit their proportionate shares of the\nincome tax paid by the Fund on that\nundistributed amount against their federal\nincome tax liabilities and to claim refunds to\nthe extent such credits exceed their\nliabilities and (iii) will be entitled to\nincrease their tax basis, for federal income\ntax purposes, in their Shares by an amount\nequal to the excess of the amount of\nundistributed net capital gain included in\ntheir respective income over their respective\nincome tax credits. If a Fund failed to\nsatisfy the Distribution Requirement for any\ntaxable year, it would be taxed as a regular\ncorporation, with consequences generally\nsimilar to those described in the preceding\nparagraph. Given the concentration of certain\nof the Indexes in a relatively small number of\nsecurities, it may not be possible for certain\nFunds to fully implement sampling\nmethodologies while satisfying the\nDiversification Requirement. A Fund's efforts\nto satisfy the Diversification Requirement may\naffect the Fund's execution of its investment\nstrategy and may cause the Fund's return to\ndeviate from that of the applicable Index, and\nthe Fund's efforts to track the applicable\nIndex may cause it inadvertently to fail to\nsatisfy the Diversification Requirement. A\nFund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on\ncertain undistributed income if it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders in each\ncalendar year an amount at least equal to 98%\nof its ordinary income for the calendar year\nplus 98.2% of its capital gain net income for\nthe twelve months ended October 31 of such\nyear, subject to an increase for any shortfall\nin the prior year's distribution. Each Fund\nintends to declare and distribute dividends\nand distributions in the amounts and at the\ntimes necessary to avoid the application of\nthis 4% excise tax. A Fund may elect to treat\npart or all of any \u201c qualified late year loss\n\u201d as if it had been incurred in the succeeding\ntaxable year in determining the Fund's taxable\nincome, net capital gain, net short-term\ncapital gain, and earnings and profits. The\neffect of this election is to treat any such \u201c\nqualified late year loss \u201d as if it had been\nincurred in the succeeding taxable year in\ncharacterizing Fund distributions for any\ncalendar year. A \u201c qualified late year loss \u201d\ngenerally includes net capital loss, net long-\nterm capital loss, or net short-term capital\nloss incurred after October 31 of the current\ntaxable year (commonly referred to as \u201c post-\nOctober losses \u201d ) and certain other late-year\nlosses. Capital losses in excess of capital\ngains ( \u201c net capital losses \u201d ) are not\npermitted to be deducted against a RIC's net\ninvestment income. Instead, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, potentially subject to\ncertain limitations, a Fund may carry a net\ncapital loss from any taxable year forward\nindefinitely to offset its capital gains, if\nany, in years following the year of the loss.\nTo the extent subsequent capital gains are\noffset by such losses, they will not result in\nU.S. federal income tax liability to the Fund\nand may not be distributed as capital gains to\nits shareholders. Generally, the Funds may not\ncarry forward any losses other than net\ncapital losses. TAXATION OF\nSHAREHOLDERS\u2014DISTRIBUTIONS Each Fund intends\nto distribute annually to its shareholders\nsubstantially all of its investment company\ntaxable income (computed without regard to the\ndeduction for dividends paid), its net tax-\nexempt income, if any, and any net capital\ngain (net recognized long-term capital gains\nin excess of net recognized short-term capital\nlosses, taking into account any capital loss\ncarryforwards). Each Fund will report to\nshareholders annually the amounts of dividends\npaid from ordinary income and the amount of\ndistributions of net capital gain. Since the\nFunds primarily hold investments that do not\npay dividends, it is not expected that a\nsubstantial portion (if any) of the dividends\npaid by a Fund will qualify for either the\ndividends-received deduction for corporations\nor the favorable income tax rates available to\nindividuals on qualified dividend income.\nDistributions from a Fund's net short-term\ncapital gains will generally be taxable to\nshareholders as ordinary income. Distributions\nfrom a Fund's net capital gain will be taxable\nto shareholders at long-term capital gains\nrates, regardless of how long shareholders\nhave held their Shares. Long-term capital\ngains are generally taxed to noncorporate\nshareholders at reduced rates. Although\ndividends generally will be treated as\ndistributed when paid, any dividend declared\nby a Fund in October, November or December and\npayable to shareholders of record in such a\nmonth that is paid during the following\nJanuary will be treated for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes as received by\nshareholders on December 31 of the calendar\nyear in which it was declared.\n\n57\n\nIf a Fund's distributions exceed its earnings\nand profits, all or a portion of the\ndistributions made in the taxable year may be\ntreated as a return of capital to\nshareholders. A return of capital distribution\ngenerally will not be taxable but will reduce\nthe shareholder's cost basis and result in a\nhigher capital gain or lower capital loss when\nthe Shares on which the distribution was\nreceived are sold. After a shareholder's basis\nin the Shares has been reduced to zero,\ndistributions in excess of earnings and\nprofits will be treated as gain from the sale\nof the shareholder's Shares. Under Section\n163(j) of the Code, a taxpayer's business\ninterest expense is generally deductible to\nthe extent of its business interest income\nplus certain other amounts. If a Fund earns\nbusiness interest income, it may report a\nportion of its dividends as \u201c Section 163(j)\ninterest dividends, \u201d which its shareholders\nmay be able to treat as business interest\nincome for purposes of Section 163(j) of the\nCode. The Fund's \u201c Section 163(j) interest\ndividend \u201d for a tax year will be limited to\nthe excess of its business interest income\nover the sum of its business interest expense\nand other deductions properly allocable to its\nbusiness interest income. In general, a Fund's\nshareholders may treat a distribution reported\nas a Section 163(j) interest dividend as\ninterest income only to the extent the\ndistribution exceeds the sum of the portions\nof the distribution reported as other types of\ntax-favored income. To be eligible to treat a\nSection 163(j) interest dividend as interest\nincome, a shareholder may need to meet certain\nholding period requirements in respect of Fund\nShares and must not have hedged its position\nin Fund Shares in certain ways. Distributions\nthat are reinvested in additional Shares of a\nFund through the means of a dividend\nreinvestment service, if offered by your\nbroker-dealer, will nevertheless be taxable\ndividends to the same extent as if such\ndividends had been received in cash. A 3.8%\nMedicare contribution tax generally applies to\nall or a portion of the net investment income\nof a shareholder who is an individual and not\na nonresident alien for federal income tax\npurposes and who has adjusted gross income\n(subject to certain adjustments) that exceeds\na threshold amount ($250,000 if married filing\njointly or if considered a \u201c surviving spouse\n\u201d for federal income tax purposes, $125,000 if\nmarried filing separately, and $200,000 in\nother cases). This 3.8% tax also applies to\nall or a portion of the undistributed net\ninvestment income of certain shareholders that\nare estates and trusts. For these purposes,\ninterest, dividends and certain capital gains\n(generally including capital gain\ndistributions and capital gains realized on\nthe sale of Shares) are generally taken into\naccount in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. Distributions of ordinary\nincome and capital gains may also be subject\nto foreign, state and local taxes depending on\na shareholder's circumstances. TAXATION OF\nSHAREHOLDERS\u2014SALE OF SHARES In general, a sale\nof Shares results in capital gain or loss, and\nfor individual shareholders, is taxable at a\nfederal rate dependent upon the length of time\nthe Shares were held. A sale of Shares held\nfor a period of one year or less at the time\nof such sale will, for tax purposes, generally\nresult in short-term capital gains or losses,\nand a sale of those held for more than one\nyear will generally result in long-term\ncapital gains or losses. Long-term capital\ngains are generally taxed to noncorporate\nshareholders at reduced rates. Gain or loss on\nthe sale of Shares is measured by the\ndifference between the amount received and the\nadjusted tax basis of the Shares. Shareholders\nshould keep records of investments made\n(including Shares acquired through\nreinvestment of dividends and distributions)\nso they can compute the tax basis of their\nShares. A loss realized on a sale of Shares\nmay be disallowed if substantially identical\nShares are acquired (whether through the\nreinvestment of dividends or otherwise) within\na sixty-one (61) day period beginning thirty\n(30) days before and ending thirty (30) days\nafter the date that the Shares are disposed\nof. In such a case, the basis of the Shares\nacquired must be adjusted to reflect the\ndisallowed loss. Any loss upon the sale of\nShares held for six (6) months or less will be\ntreated as long-term capital loss to the\nextent of any amounts treated as distributions\nto the shareholder of long-term capital gain\n(including any amounts credited to the\nshareholder as undistributed capital gains).\nCOST BASIS REPORTING The cost basis of Shares\nacquired by purchase will generally be based\non the amount paid for the Shares and then may\nbe subsequently adjusted for other applicable\ntransactions as required by the Internal\nRevenue Code. The difference between the\nselling price and the cost basis of Shares\ngenerally determines the amount of the capital\ngain or loss realized on the sale or exchange\nof Shares. Contact the broker through whom you\npurchased your Shares to obtain information\nwith respect to the available cost basis\nreporting methods and elections for your\naccount.\n\n58\n\nTAXATION OF FUND INVESTMENTS Dividends and\ninterest received by a Fund on foreign\nsecurities may give rise to withholding and\nother taxes imposed by foreign countries. Tax\nconventions between certain countries and the\nUnited States may reduce or eliminate such\ntaxes. If a Fund meets certain requirements,\nwhich include a requirement that more than 50%\nof the value of the Fund's total assets at the\nclose of its respective taxable year consist\nof certain foreign securities (generally\nincluding foreign government securities), then\nthe Fund should be eligible to file an\nelection with the IRS that may enable its\nshareholders, in effect, to receive either the\nbenefit of a foreign tax credit, or a tax\ndeduction, with respect to certain foreign and\nU.S. possessions income taxes paid by the\nFund, subject to certain limitations. Pursuant\nto this election, a Fund would treat the\napplicable foreign taxes as dividends paid to\nits shareholders. Each such shareholder would\nbe required to include a proportionate share\nof those taxes in gross income as income\nreceived from a foreign source and must treat\nthe amount so included as if the shareholder\nhad paid the foreign tax directly. The\nshareholder may then either deduct the taxes\ndeemed paid by him or her in computing his or\nher taxable income or, alternatively, use the\nforegoing information in calculating any\nforeign tax credit the shareholder may be\nentitled to use against such shareholder's\nfederal income tax. If a Fund makes this\nelection, the Fund will report annually to its\nshareholders the respective amounts per share\nof the Fund's income from sources within, and\ntaxes paid to, foreign countries and U.S.\npossessions. No deduction for such taxes will\nbe permitted to individuals in computing their\nalternative minimum tax liability. If a Fund\ndoes not make this election, the Fund will be\nentitled to claim a deduction for certain\nforeign taxes incurred by the Fund. In certain\ninstances, the Fund might not elect to apply\notherwise allowable U.S. federal income tax\ndeductions for those foreign taxes, whether or\nnot credits or deductions for those foreign\ntaxes could be passed through to its\nshareholders pursuant to the election\ndescribed above. If the Fund does not elect to\napply these deductions, taxable distributions\nyou receive from the Fund may be larger than\nthey would have been if the Fund had taken\ndeductions for such taxes. Under certain\ncircumstances, if a Fund receives a refund of\nforeign taxes paid in respect of a prior year,\nthe value of Shares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions passed\nthrough to shareholders in respect of the\nFund's foreign taxes for the current year\ncould be reduced. Certain of the Funds'\ninvestments may be subject to complex\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code\n(including provisions relating to hedging\ntransactions, straddles, integrated\ntransactions, foreign currency contracts,\nforward foreign currency contracts, and\nnotional principal contracts) that, among\nother things, may affect the character of\ngains and losses realized by a Fund (e.g., may\naffect whether gains or losses are ordinary or\ncapital), accelerate recognition of income to\nthe Fund and defer losses. These rules could\ntherefore affect the character, amount and\ntiming of distributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also may require a Fund to mark-to-\nmarket certain types of positions in its\nportfolio (i.e., treat them as if they were\nclosed out) which may cause the Fund to\nrecognize income without receiving cash with\nwhich to make distributions to its\nshareholders in amounts necessary to satisfy\nthe RIC distribution requirements for avoiding\nincome and excise taxes. The Funds intend to\nmonitor their transactions, intend to make\nappropriate tax elections, and intend to make\nappropriate entries in their books and records\nin order to mitigate the effect of these rules\nand preserve the Funds' qualification for\ntreatment as RICs. Each Fund is required for\nfederal income tax purposes to mark-to-market\nand recognize as income for each taxable year\nits net unrealized gains and losses on certain\nfutures contracts as of the end of the year as\nwell as those actually realized during the\nyear. Gain or loss from futures and options\ncontracts on broad-based indexes required to\nbe marked to market will be 60% long-term and\n40% short-term capital gain or loss.\nApplication of this rule may alter the timing\nand character of distributions to\nshareholders. A Fund may be required to defer\nthe recognition of losses on futures\ncontracts, options contracts and swaps to the\nextent of any unrecognized gains on offsetting\npositions held by the Fund. It is anticipated\nthat certain net gain realized from the\nclosing out of futures or options contracts\nwill be considered gain from the sale of\nsecurities and therefore will be qualifying\nincome for purposes of the Qualifying Income\nRequirement. Investments by a Fund in zero\ncoupon or other discount securities will\nresult in income to the Fund equal to a\nportion of the excess face value of the\nsecurities over their issue price (the \u201c\noriginal issue discount \u201d or \u201c OID \u201d ) each\nyear that the securities are held, even though\nthe Fund may receive no cash interest payments\nor may receive cash interest payments that are\nless than the income recognized for tax\npurposes. In other circumstances, whether\npursuant to the terms of a security or as a\nresult of other factors outside the control of\nthe Fund, a Fund may recognize income without\nreceiving a commensurate amount of cash. Such\nincome is included in determining the amount\nof income that a Fund must distribute to\nmaintain its eligibility for treatment as a\nRIC and to avoid the payment of federal income\ntax, including the nondeductible 4% excise tax\ndescribed above.\n\n59\n\nAny market discount recognized on a market\ndiscount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A\nmarket discount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue, or below adjusted issue price if issued\nwith original issue discount. Absent an\nelection by a Fund to include the market\ndiscount in income as it accrues, gain on the\nFund's disposition of such an obligation will\nbe treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued\nmarket discount. Where the income required to\nbe recognized as a result of the OID and/or\nmarket discount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash receipt by a Fund, the Fund\nmay be required to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to enable the Fund to make\ndistributions to its shareholders in order to\nqualify for treatment as a RIC and eliminate\ntaxes at the Fund level. Special rules apply\nif a Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds, such\nas Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities\n(TIPS). Generally, all stated interest on\ninflation-indexed bonds is taken into income\nby a Fund under its regular method of\naccounting for interest income. The amount of\nany positive inflation adjustment for a\ntaxable year, which results from an increase\nin the inflation-adjusted principal amount of\nthe bond, is treated as OID. The amount of a\nFund's OID in a taxable year with respect to a\nbond will increase a Fund's taxable income for\nsuch year without a corresponding receipt of\ncash, until the bond matures. As a result, the\nFund may need to use other sources of cash to\nsatisfy its distribution requirements for the\napplicable year. The amount of any negative\ninflation adjustments, which result from a\ndecrease in the inflation-adjusted principal\namount of the bond, first reduces the amount\nof interest (including stated interest, OID,\nand market discount, if any) otherwise\nincludable in the Fund's taxable income with\nrespect to the bond for the taxable year; any\nremaining negative adjustments will be either\ntreated as ordinary loss or, in certain\ncircumstances, carried forward to reduce the\namount of interest income taken into account\nwith respect to the bond in future taxable\nyears. TAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS Certain tax-\nexempt shareholders, including qualified\npension plans, individual retirement accounts,\nsalary deferral arrangements, 401(k) plans,\nand other tax-exempt entities, generally are\nexempt from federal income taxation except\nwith respect to their unrelated business\ntaxable income ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ). Under current\nlaw, a Fund generally serves to block UBTI\nfrom being realized by its tax-exempt\nshareholders. However, notwithstanding the\nforegoing, tax-exempt shareholders could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of their investment in\na Fund where, for example, (i) the Fund\ninvests in REITs that hold residual interests\nin real estate mortgage investment conduits (\n\u201c REMICs \u201d ) or (ii) Shares constitute debt-\nfinanced property in the hands of the tax-\nexempt shareholders within the meaning of\nsection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCharitable remainder trusts are subject to\nspecial rules and should consult their tax\nadvisors. The IRS has issued guidance with\nrespect to these issues and prospective\nshareholders, especially charitable remainder\ntrusts, are strongly encouraged to consult\nwith their tax advisors regarding these\nissues. Certain tax-exempt educational\ninstitutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on\nnet investment income. For these purposes,\ncertain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Shares (among other categories\nof income), are generally taken into account\nin computing a shareholder's net investment\nincome. FOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS Dividends, other\nthan capital gains dividends, \u201c short-term\ncapital gain dividends \u201d and \u201c interest-\nrelated dividends \u201d (described below), paid by\na Fund to shareholders who are nonresident\naliens or foreign entities will be subject to\na 30% United States withholding tax unless a\nreduced rate of withholding or a withholding\nexemption is provided under applicable treaty\nlaw to the extent derived from investment\nincome and short-term capital gain or unless\nsuch income is effectively connected with a\nU.S. trade or business carried on through a\npermanent establishment in the United States.\nNonresident shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors concerning the\napplicability of the United States withholding\ntax and the proper withholding form(s) to be\nsubmitted to a Fund. A non-U.S. shareholder\nwho fails to provide an appropriate IRS Form\nW-8 may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Dividends reported by a\nFund as (i) interest-related dividends, to the\nextent such dividends are derived from the\nFund's \u201c qualified net interest income, \u201d or\n(ii) short-term capital gain dividends, to the\nextent such dividends are derived from the\nFund's \u201c qualified short-term gain, \u201d are\ngenerally exempt from this 30% withholding\ntax. \u201c Qualified net interest income \u201d is a\nFund's net income derived from U.S.-source\ninterest and original issue discount, subject\nto certain exceptions and limitations. \u201c\nQualified short-term gain \u201d generally means\nthe excess of a Fund's net short-term capital\ngain for the taxable year over its net long-\nterm capital loss, if any. In the case of\nShares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if a Fund\nreports the payment as an interest-related\ndividend or as a short-term capital gain\ndividend. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact\ntheir intermediaries with respect to the\napplication of these rules to their accounts.\n\n60\n\nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold\nShares comply with IRS requirements that will\ngenerally require them to report information\nregarding U.S. persons investing in, or\nholding accounts with, such entities, a 30%\nwithholding tax may apply to Fund\ndistributions payable to such entities. A\nnon-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the\nwithholding described in this paragraph under\nan applicable intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the U.S. and a foreign government,\nprovided that the shareholder and the\napplicable foreign government comply with the\nterms of such agreement. BACKUP WITHHOLDING A\nFund will be required in certain cases to\nwithhold (as \u201c backup withholding \u201d ) on\namounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has\nprovided the Fund either an incorrect tax\nidentification number or no number at all, (2)\nis subject to backup withholding by the IRS\nfor failure to properly report payments of\ninterest or dividends, (3) has failed to\ncertify to the Fund that such shareholder is\nnot subject to backup withholding, or (4) has\nnot certified that such shareholder is a U.S.\nperson (including a U.S. resident alien). The\nbackup withholding rate is currently 24%.\nBackup withholding will not be applied to\npayments that have been subject to the 30%\nwithholding tax on shareholders who are\nneither citizens nor permanent residents of\nthe U.S. CREATION UNITS An Authorized\nParticipant who exchanges securities for\nCreation Units generally will recognize a gain\nor a loss. The gain or loss will be equal to\nthe difference between the market value of the\nCreation Units at the time and the sum of the\nexchanger's aggregate basis in the securities\nsurrendered plus the amount of cash paid for\nsuch Creation Units. A person who redeems\nCreation Units will generally recognize a gain\nor loss equal to the difference between the\nexchanger's basis in the Creation Units and\nthe sum of the aggregate market value of any\nsecurities received plus the amount of any\ncash received for such Creation Units. The\nIRS, however, may assert that a loss realized\nupon an exchange of securities for Creation\nUnits cannot be deducted currently under the\nrules governing \u201c wash sales, \u201d or on the\nbasis that there has been no significant\nchange in economic position. Any gain or loss\nrealized upon a creation of Creation Units\nwill be treated as capital gain or loss if the\nAuthorized Participant holds the securities\nexchanged therefor as capital assets, and\notherwise will be ordinary income or loss.\nSimilarly, any gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption of Creation Units will be treated\nas capital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Shares comprising the\nCreation Units as capital assets, and\notherwise will be ordinary income or loss. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon the\ncreation of Creation Units will generally be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss if\nthe securities exchanged for such Creation\nUnits have been held for more than one year,\nand otherwise will be short-term capital gain\nor loss. Any capital gain or loss realized\nupon the redemption of Creation Units will\ngenerally be treated as long-term capital gain\nor loss if the Shares comprising the Creation\nUnits have been held for more than one year,\nand otherwise, will generally be short-term\ncapital gain or loss. Any capital loss\nrealized upon a redemption of Creation Units\nheld for six (6) months or less will be\ntreated as a long-term capital loss to the\nextent of any amounts treated as distributions\nto the applicable Authorized Participant of\nlong-term capital gains with respect to the\nCreation Units (including any amounts credited\nto the Authorized Participant as undistributed\ncapital gains). A Fund has the right to reject\nan order for Creation Units if the purchaser\n(or a group of purchasers) would, upon\nobtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80% or\nmore of the outstanding shares of the Fund and\nif, pursuant to section 351 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, the Fund would have a basis in\nany deposit securities different from the\nmarket value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. A Fund also has the right to require\ninformation necessary to determine beneficial\nShare ownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. If a Fund does issue Creation\nUnits to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund, the purchaser\n(or a group of purchasers) may not recognize\ngain or loss upon the exchange of securities\nfor Creation Units. If a Fund redeems Creation\nUnits in cash, it may bear additional costs\nand recognize more capital gains than it would\nif it redeems Creation Units in kind. Persons\npurchasing or redeeming Creation Units should\nconsult their own tax advisors with respect to\nthe tax treatment of any creation or\nredemption transaction.\n\n61\n\nCERTAIN POTENTIAL TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\nUnder promulgated Treasury regulations, if a\nshareholder recognizes a loss on disposition\nof a Fund's shares of $2 million or more for\nan individual shareholder or $10 million or\nmore for a corporate shareholder (or certain\ngreater amounts over a combination of years),\nthe shareholder must file with the IRS a\ndisclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct\nshareholders of portfolio securities are in\nmany cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not excepted. A\nshareholder who fails to make the required\ndisclosure to the IRS may be subject to\nadverse tax consequences, including\nsignificant penalties. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer's treatment of the loss is proper.\nShareholders should consult their tax advisers\nto determine the applicability of these\nregulations in light of their individual\ncircumstances. The foregoing discussion is a\nsummary only and is not intended as a\nsubstitute for careful tax planning.\nPurchasers of Shares should consult their own\ntax advisors as to the tax consequences of\ninvesting in such Shares, including under\nstate, local and other tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date hereof. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur. STATE TAX MATTERS The discussion\nof state and local tax treatment is based on\nthe assumptions that the Funds will qualify\nfor treatment under Subchapter M of the\nInternal Revenue Code as RICs and that each\nFund will distribute all interest and\ndividends it receives to its shareholders. The\ntax discussion summarizes general state and\nlocal tax laws which are currently in effect\nand which are subject to change by\nlegislative, judicial or administrative\naction; any such changes may be retroactive\nwith respect to the applicable Fund's\ntransactions. Investors should consult a tax\nadvisor for more detailed information about\nstate and local taxes to which they may be\nsubject. Many states grant tax-free status to\ndividends paid to you from interest earned on\ndirect obligations of the U.S. government,\nsubject in some states to minimum investment\nrequirements that must be met by the Fund.\nInvestment in Government National Mortgage\nAssociation ( \u201c Ginnie Mae \u201d ) or Federal\nNational Mortgage Association ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d\n) securities, banker's acceptances, commercial\npaper, and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\ndo not generally qualify for such tax-free\ntreatment. The rules on exclusion of this\nincome are different for corporate\nshareholders. Capital Stock and Other\nSecurities Each Fund issues Shares of\nbeneficial interest, par value $.01 per Share.\nThe Board may designate additional funds. Each\nShare issued by the Trust has a pro rata\ninterest in the assets of the corresponding\nseries of the Trust. Shares have no\npreemptive, exchange, subscription or\nconversion rights and are freely transferable.\nEach Share is entitled to participate equally\nin dividends and distributions declared by the\nBoard with respect to each Fund, and in the\nnet distributable assets of each Fund on\nliquidation. Each Share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which a shareholder\nvote is required consistent with the\nrequirements of the 1940 Act and the rules\npromulgated thereunder. Shares of all series\nof the Trust ( \u201c Funds \u201d ) vote together as a\nsingle class except that if the matter being\nvoted on affects only a particular fund it\nwill be voted on only by that fund and if a\nmatter affects a particular fund differently\nfrom other Funds, that fund will vote\nseparately on such matter. Under Massachusetts\nlaw, the Trust is not required to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the\nTrust is not to hold an annual meeting of\nshareholders unless required to do so under\nthe 1940 Act. All Shares of the Trust\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights for the election of Trustees.\nUnder Massachusetts law, Trustees of the Trust\nmay be removed by vote of the shareholders.\nUnder Massachusetts law, shareholders of a\nbusiness trust may, under certain\ncircumstances, be held personally liable as\npartners for obligations of the Trust.\nHowever, the Declaration of Trust contains an\nexpress disclaimer of shareholder liability\nfor acts or obligations of the Trust, requires\nthat Trust obligations include such\ndisclaimer, and provides for indemnification\nand reimbursement of expenses out of the\nTrust's property for any shareholder held\npersonally liable for\n\n62\n\nthe obligations of the Trust. Thus, the risk\nof a shareholder incurring financial loss on\naccount of shareholder liability is limited to\ncircumstances in which the Trust itself would\nbe unable to meet its obligations. Given the\nabove limitations on shareholder personal\nliability, and the nature of each Fund's\nassets and operations, the risk to\nshareholders of personal liability is believed\nto be remote. Shareholder inquiries may be\nmade by writing to the Trust, c/o the\nDistributor, State Street Global Advisors\nFunds Distributors, LLC at One Iron Street,\nBoston, Massachusetts 02210. Counsel and\nIndependent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, located at 1111\nPennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004,\nserves as counsel to the Trust. Ernst & Young\nLLP, located at 200 Clarendon Street, Boston,\nMA 02116, serves as the independent registered\npublic accounting firm of the Trust. Ernst &\nYoung LLP performs annual audits of the Funds'\nfinancial statements and provides other audit,\ntax and related services. Local Market Holiday\nSchedules The Trust generally intends to\neffect deliveries of portfolio securities on a\nbasis of \u201c T \u201d plus two Business Days (i.e.,\ndays on which the NYSE is open), or in the\ncase of the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets\nLocal Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International\nGovernment Inflation-Protected Bond ETF on a\nbasis of \u201c T \u201d plus three Business Days, in\nthe relevant foreign market of a Fund. The\nability of the Trust to effect in-kind\nredemptions within two or three Business Days,\nas applicable, of receipt of a redemption\nrequest is subject, among other things, to the\ncondition that, within the time period from\nthe date of the request to the date of\ndelivery of the securities, there are no days\nthat are local market holidays on the relevant\nBusiness Days. For every occurrence of one or\nmore intervening holidays in the local market\nthat are not holidays observed in the United\nStates, the redemption settlement cycle may be\nextended by the number of such intervening\nlocal holidays. In addition to holidays, other\nunforeseeable closings in a foreign market due\nto emergencies may also prevent the Trust from\ndelivering securities within two or three\nBusiness Days, as applicable. The securities\ndelivery cycles currently practicable for\ntransferring portfolio securities to redeeming\ninvestors, coupled with local market holiday\nschedules, may require a delivery process\nlonger than the standard settlement period.

We conduct            \n            issuer-specific engagements with  \n            companies to discuss our          \n            principles, including             \n            sustainability-related risks and  \n            opportunities. In addition, we    \n            encourage issuers to find ways    \n            to increase the amount of direct  \n            communication board members have  \n            with shareholders. Direct         \n            communication with executive      \n            board members and independent     \n            non-executive directors is        \n            critical to helping companies     \n            understand shareholder concerns.  \n            In conducting our engagements,    \n            we also evaluate the various      \n            factors that influence the        \n            corporate governance framework    \n            of a country, including the       \n            macroeconomic conditions and      \n            broader political system, the     \n            quality of regulatory oversight,  \n            the enforcement of property and   \n            shareholder rights, and the       \n            independence of the judiciary.    \n            We understand that regulatory     \n            requirements and investor         \n            expectations relating to          \n            governance practices and          \n            engagement activities differ      \n            from country to country. As a     \n            result, we engage with issuers,   \n            regulators, or a combination of   \n            the two depending upon the        \n            market. We are also a member of   \n            various investor associations     \n            that seek to address broader      \n            corporate governance-related      \n            policy at the country level.      \n            The State Street Global Advisors  \n            Asset Stewardship Team may        \n            consult with members of various   \n            investment teams to engage with   \n            companies on corporate            \n            governance issues and to address  \n            any specific concerns. This       \n            facilitates our comprehensive     \n            approach to information           \n            gathering as it relates to items  \n            that are to be voted upon at      \n            upcoming shareholder meetings.    \n            We also conduct issuer-specific   \n            engagements with companies,       \n            covering various corporate        \n            governance and                    \n            sustainability-related topics     \n            outside of proxy season.          \n            The Asset Stewardship Team        \n            employs a blend of quantitative   \n            and qualitative research,         \n            analysis and data in order to     \n            support screens that identify     \n            issuers where active engagement   \n            may be necessary to protect and   \n            promote shareholder value.        \n            Issuer engagement may also be     \n            event-driven, focusing on         \n            issuer-specific corporate         \n            governance or sustainability      \n            concerns, or broader              \n            industry-related trends. We also  \n            consider the size of our total    \n            position in the issuer in         \n            question and/or the potential     \n            negative governance, performance  \n            profile, and circumstance at      \n            hand. As a result, we believe     \n            issuer engagement can take many   \n            forms and be triggered by         \n            numerous circumstances. The       \n            following approaches represent    \n            how we define engagement          \n            methods:                          \n            We use screening tools designed   \n            to capture a mix of               \n  Active    company-specific data, including  \n            governance and sustainability     \n            profiles, to inform our voting    \n            and engagement activity.          \n                                              \nC-3                                           \n                                              \n                 We will actively seek        \n                 direct dialogue with the     \n                 board and management of      \n                 companies that we have       \n                 identified through our       \n                 screening processes. Such    \n                 engagements may lead to      \n                 further monitoring to        \n                 ensure that the company      \n                 improves its governance or   \n                 sustainability practices.    \n                 In these cases, the          \n                 engagement process           \n                 represents the most          \n                 meaningful opportunity for   \n                 us to protect long-term      \n                 shareholder value from       \n                 excessive risk due to poor   \n                 governance and               \n                 sustainability practices.    \n                 Reactive engagement is       \n                 initiated by issuers. We     \n                 routinely discuss specific   \n                 voting issues and items      \n  Reactive       with the issuer community.   \n                 Reactive engagement is an    \n                 opportunity to address not   \n                 only voting items, but also  \n                 a wide range of governance   \n                 and sustainability issues.   \n                 We have established an       \n                 engagement protocol that     \n                 further describes our        \n                 approach to issuer           \n                 engagement.                  \n                 Our stewardship activities   \n                 are designed to have an      \n                 impact on company-specific   \n  Measurement    and market-level disclosure  \n                 and oversight practices      \n                 that we believe protect and  \n                 promote shareholder value.   \n                 Company-specific successes   \n                 Assessing the effectiveness  \n                 of our company-specific      \n                 engagement process can be    \n                 challenging to measure. To   \n                 limit subjectivity in        \n                 measuring our success, we    \n                 actively seek issuer         \n                 feedback and monitor the     \n                 actions taken by issuers     \n                 post-engagement in order to  \n                 identify tangible changes.   \n                 This enables us to           \n                 establish indicators to      \n                 gauge how issuers respond    \n                 to our concerns and to what  \n                 degree these responses       \n                 satisfy our requests.

Persons Controlled By or Under Common\nControl With Registrant The Board of Trustees\nof the Trust is the same as the Boards of\nTrustees of SPDR Index Shares Funds and SSGA\nActive Trust. In addition, the officers of the\nTrust are substantially identical to the\nofficers of SPDR Index Shares Funds and SSGA\nActive Trust. Additionally, the Trust\u2019s\ninvestment adviser, SSGA FM, also serves as\ninvestment adviser to each series of SPDR\nIndex Shares Funds and SSGA Active Trust.\nNonetheless, the Trust takes the position that\nit is not under common control with other\ntrusts because the power residing in the\nrespective boards and officers arises as the\nresult of an official position with the\nrespective trusts. Additionally, see the\n\u201cControl Persons and Principal Holders of\nSecurities\u201d section of the Statement of\nAdditional Information for a list of\nshareholders who own more than 5% of a\nspecific fund\u2019s outstanding shares and such\ninformation is incorporated by reference to\nthis Item. Item 30. Indemnification Pursuant\nto Section 5.3 of the Registrant\u2019s Amended and\nRestated Declaration of Trust and under\nSection 4.9 of the Registrant\u2019s By-Laws, the\nTrust will indemnify any person who is, or has\nbeen, a Trustee, officer, employee or agent of\nthe Trust against all expenses reasonably\nincurred or paid by him/her in connection with\nany claim, action, suit or proceeding in which\nhe/she becomes involved as a party or\notherwise by virtue of his/her being or having\nbeen a Trustee, officer, employee or agent and\nagainst amounts paid or incurred by him/her in\nthe settlement thereof, if he/she acted in\ngood faith and in a manner he/she reasonably\nbelieved to be in or not opposed to the best\ninterests of the Trust, and, with respect to\nany criminal action or proceeding, had no\nreasonable cause to believe his/her conduct\n\nwas unlawful. In addition, indemnification is\npermitted only if it is determined that the\nactions in question did not render him/her\nliable by reason of willful misfeasance, bad\nfaith or gross negligence in the performance\nof his/her duties or by reason of reckless\ndisregard of his/her obligations and duties to\nthe Registrant. The Registrant may also\nadvance money for litigation expenses provided\nthat Trustees, officers, employees and/or\nagents give their undertakings to repay the\nRegistrant unless their conduct is later\ndetermined to permit indemnification. Pursuant\nto Section 5.2 of the Registrant\u2019s Amended and\nRestated Declaration of Trust, no Trustee,\nofficer, employee or agent of the Registrant\nshall be liable for any action or failure to\nact, except in the case of willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence or\nreckless disregard of duties to the\nRegistrant. Pursuant to paragraph 9 of the\nRegistrant\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement,\nthe Adviser shall not be liable for any action\nor failure to act, except in the case of\nwillful misfeasance, bad faith or gross\nnegligence or reckless disregard of duties to\nthe Registrant. Insofar as indemnification for\nliability arising under the Securities Act of\n1933 (the \u201cAct\u201d) may be permitted to\ndirectors, officers and controlling persons of\nthe Registrant pursuant to the provisions of\nRule 484 under the Act, or otherwise, the\nRegistrant has been advised that in the\nopinion of the SEC such indemnification is\nagainst public policy as expressed in the Act\nand is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event\nthat a claim for indemnification against such\nliabilities (other than the payment by the\nRegistrant of expenses incurred or paid by a\ndirector, officer or controlling person of the\nRegistrant in the successful defense of any\naction, suit or proceeding) is asserted by\nsuch director, officer or controlling person\nin connection with the securities being\nregistered, the Registrant will, unless in the\nopinion of its counsel the matter has been\nsettled by controlling precedent, submit to a\ncourt of appropriate jurisdiction the question\nwhether such indemnification by it is against\npublic policy as expressed in the Act and will\nbe governed by the final adjudication of such\nissue. The Registrant hereby undertakes that\nit will apply the indemnification provision of\nits By-Laws in a manner consistent with\nRelease 11330 of the SEC under the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940\nAct\u201d), so long as the interpretation of\nSections 17(h) and 17(i) thereunder remains in\neffect. The Registrant maintains insurance on\nbehalf of any person who is or was a Trustee,\nofficer, employee or agent of the Registrant,\nor who is or was serving at the request of the\nRegistrant as a trustee, director, officer,\nemployee or agent of another trust or\ncorporation, against any liability asserted\nagainst him/her and incurred by him/her or\narising out of his/her position. However, in\nno event will the Registrant maintain\ninsurance to indemnify any such person for any\nact for which the Registrant itself is not\npermitted to indemnify him/her.
