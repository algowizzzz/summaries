Each Fund may lend its\nportfolio securities in an amount not to\nexceed 40% of the value of its net\nassets via a securities lending program\nthrough its securities lending agent, State\nStreet Bank and Trust Company (\u0093State Street\u0094\nor the \u0093Lending Agent\u0094), to brokers, dealers\nand other financial institutions desiring to\nborrow\nsecurities to complete transactions and for\nother purposes.

To the extent a\nFund receives cash collateral, as of the date\nof this Prospectus, the Adviser expects to\ninvest such cash\ncollateral in a fund managed by the Adviser\nthat invests in: a broad range of money market\ninstruments; certificates of deposit and time\ndeposits of U.S. and foreign banks; commercial\npaper and other high quality obligations of\nU.S. or foreign\ncompanies; asset-backed securities; mortgage-\nrelated securities; repurchase agreements; and\nshares of money market funds. In the\nsecurities lending program, the borrower\ngenerally has the right to vote the loaned\nsecurities; however, a Fund may call\nloans to vote proxies if a material issue\naffecting the Fund\u0092s economic interest in the\ninvestment is to be voted upon. Security loans\nmay be terminated at any time by a Fund.\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE\nREFERENCE\n\n050222SUPP4\n"
