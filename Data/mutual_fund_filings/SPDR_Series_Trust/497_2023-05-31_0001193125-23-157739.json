Scope 1 emissions     \n       are direct GHG emissions that occur    \n       from sources that are controlled or    \n       owned by an organization. Scope 2      \n       emissions are indirect GHG emissions   \n  \u2022    generated in the production of         \n       electricity consumed by the            \n       organization.
