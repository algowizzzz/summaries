  "text": "SPDR \u00aeSeries Trust\n\nSPDR FTSE International Government Inflation-\nProtected Bond ETF\n\n(the \u0093Fund\u0094)\n\nSupplement dated July 29, 2020 to the\nProspectus\n\ndated April 30, 2020, as may be supplemented\nfrom time to time\n\nEffective July 31, 2020, the fourth paragraph\nin \u0093THE FUND\u0092S PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY\u0094\n\nsection beginning on page 25 is deleted and\nreplaced with the following:\n\nThe Index is a market-value weight, capped\ntotal return index, in which the maximum\nmarket capitalization-based weights of each\nindividual country in the Index\ncannot exceed 22.5% of the total Index weight.\nThe total market weights of countries with\nmore than 4.6% market weight in the Index\ncannot collectively exceed 45% of the total\nIndex weight and the number of countries with\nmore than 4.6% market\nweight in the Index can be no less than five.\nIf the combined weights of each country with\nmore than 4.6% market weight exceeds 45% of\nthe total Index weight, then the weights of\nthose countries are reduced in proportion to\neach country\u0092s\nmarket capitalizations until they sum to 45%,\nand the weights of the remaining smaller\ncountries are increased in proportion to each\ncountry\u0092s market capitalizations by the same\namount. After the country weights are\ndetermined, constituents\nwithin each country are assigned weights in\nproportion to their market capitalization.\nAdditionally, an index quality is assigned to\neach Index bond as of profile fixing. The\nquality is first mapped to the S&P rating. If\na bond is not rated by\nS&P but is rated by Moody\u0092s, the S&P\nequivalent of the Moody\u0092s rating is assigned\nto the index quality. If a bond is rated as\ninvestment-grade by one rating agency and\nhigh-yield by the other, the S&P equivalent of\nthe\ninvestment-grade rating is assigned to the\nindex quality. If a bond is rated by neither\nS&P nor Moody\u0092s, the bond is not assigned an\nindex quality. When an issuer defaults, is\nassigned a D rating by S&P, or enters into\nChapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection\nin the U.S. (or equivalent in its local\nmarket), its bonds remain in the Index until\nthe end of the month. The Index is rebalanced\nmonthly, on the last day of the month.\nCountries covered in\nthe Index as of June 30, 2020 comprised:\nAustralia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia,\nFrance, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico,\nNew Zealand, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,\nSweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom,\nalthough this\nmay change from time to time. As of June 30,\n2020, a significant portion of the Fund\ncomprised companies located in Europe and the\nUnited Kingdom, although this may change from\ntime to time. As of June 30, 2020, there were\napproximately\n173 securities in the Index.\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE\nREFERENCE\n\n072920SUPP1\n"
