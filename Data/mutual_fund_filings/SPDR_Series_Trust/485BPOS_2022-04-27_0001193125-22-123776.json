You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.30%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.30%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the\nend of those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $31        $97    $169     $381  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal\nyear, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was\n22% of the average value of its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal Investment Strategy In\nseeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg EM Local Currency Government\nDiversified Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that\nthe Fund is not required to purchase all of\nthe securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe Fund's investment adviser, and/or State\nStreet Global Advisors Limited (\u201cSSGA LTD\u201d or\nthe \u201cSub-Adviser\u201d), the investment sub-adviser\nto the Fund, either may invest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of securities in the Index\nor may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined\nby the Adviser/Sub-Adviser to be in the best\ninterest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index and in\nsecurities that the Adviser/Sub-Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that\nare substantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index.\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents In addition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments, such as repurchase agreements and\nmoney market funds (including money market\nfunds advised by the Adviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries, but only to the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries. The Fund may also enter\ninto forward currency exchange contracts for\nhedging and/or investment purposes. Swaps and\nfutures contracts may be used by the Fund in\nseeking performance that corresponds to its\nIndex and in managing cash flows. The Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of the\nfixed-rate local currency sovereign debt of\nemerging market countries. The Index includes\ngovernment bonds issued by investment grade\nand non-investment grade countries outside the\nUnited States, in local currencies, that have\na remaining maturity of one year or more and\nare rated B3/B-/B- or higher using the middle\nrating of Moody's Investors Service, Inc., S&P\nGlobal Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Inc.,\nrespectively. Each of the component securities\nin the Index is a constituent of the Bloomberg\nEM Local Currency Government Index. As of\nFebruary 28, 2022, a significant portion of\nthe Fund comprised companies located in Asia,\nalthough this may change from time to time. As\nof February 28, 2022, there were approximately\n614 securities in the Index. The Index is\ncalculated by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\n(as defined below) using a modified \u201cmarket\ncapitalization\u201d methodology. This design\nensures that each constituent country within\nthe Index is represented in a proportion\nconsistent with its percentage with respect to\nthe total market capitalization of the Index.\nComponent securities in each constituent\ncountry are represented in a proportion\nconsistent with their percentage relative to\nthe other component securities in the\nconstituent country. The securities in the\nIndex are updated on the last business day of\neach month. The Index is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund, the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the\nFund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund\nShares will change in value, and you could\nlose money by investing in the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other\npublic health issues, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). If the principal on a\ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,\nthe prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by the\nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. 2 Table of Contents Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk: Non-U.S. securities are\nsubject to political, regulatory, and economic\nrisks not present in domestic investments.\nThere may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to accounting, auditing, legal and\nfinancial report standards comparable to those\nin the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to\nrisks associated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility; differing securities market\nstructures; higher transaction costs; and\nvarious administrative difficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and settling portfolio\ntransactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges\nthat are closed when the exchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is open, there may be\ndeviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed\nforeign market. These deviations could result\nin the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts\ngreater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on\nforeign markets may be less liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities traded domestically.\nForeign governments may impose restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated in a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks such as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign\nexchange transactions. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Certain countries have recently\nexperienced (or currently are expected to\nexperience) negative interest rates on certain\nfixed-income securities, and similar interest\nrate conditions may be experienced in other\nregions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest\nrates may magnify the Fund's susceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and diminish yield and\nperformance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced\nliquidity. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets include, among\nothers, greater political and economic\ninstability, greater volatility in currency\nexchange rates, less developed securities\nmarkets, possible trade barriers, currency\ntransfer restrictions, a more limited number\nof potential buyers and issuers, an emerging\nmarket country's dependence on revenue from\nparticular commodities or international aid,\nless governmental supervision and regulation,\nunavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial\nreporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for\nunfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The\nsecurities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections\nmay limit very significantly the liquidity of\nsecurities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of\nall companies in the country or region. The\nFund may be unable to liquidate its positions\nin such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater\nfor investments in frontier market countries,\nwhich typically have smaller economies or less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries. Sovereign Debt\nObligations Risk: Investments in debt\nsecurities issued by governments or by\ngovernment agencies and instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that the governmental\nentities responsible for repayment may be\nunable or unwilling to pay interest and repay\nprincipal when due. Many sovereign debt\nobligations may be rated below investment-\ngrade (\u201cjunk\u201d bonds). Any restructuring of a\nsovereign debt obligation held by the Fund\nwill likely have a significant adverse effect\non the value of the obligation. In the event\nof default of sovereign debt, the Fund may be\nunable to pursue legal action against the\nsovereign issuer or to realize on collateral\nsecuring the debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares\nmay be bought and sold in the secondary market\nat market prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Below\nInvestment-Grade Securities Risk: Lower-\nquality debt securities (\u201chigh yield\u201d or\n\u201cjunk\u201d bonds) are considered predominantly\nspeculative, and can involve a substantially\ngreater risk of default than higher quality\ndebt securities. Issuers of lower-quality debt\nsecurities may have substantially greater risk\nof insolvency or bankruptcy than issuers of\nhigher-quality debt securities. They can be\nilliquid, and their values can have\nsignificant volatility and may decline\nsignificantly over short periods of time.\nLower-quality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or\nthe market or economy in general. 3 Table of\nContents Currency Risk: The value of the\nFund's assets may be affected favorably or\nunfavorably by currency exchange rates,\ncurrency exchange control regulations, and\ndelays, restrictions or prohibitions on the\nrepatriation of foreign currencies. Foreign\ncurrency exchange rates may have significant\nvolatility, and changes in the values of\nforeign currencies against the U.S. dollar may\nresult in substantial declines in the values\nof the Fund's assets denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. Forward Currency Contracts Risk:\nIn a forward currency contract, the Fund\nagrees to buy in the future an amount in one\ncurrency in return for another currency, at an\nexchange rate determined at the time the\ncontract is entered into. If currency exchange\nrates have moved against the Fund's position\nat the time the contract is settled or closed,\nthe Fund will lose money on the contract.\nThere is no limit on the extent to which\nexchange rates may move against the Fund's\nposition. The markets for certain currencies\nmay at times become illiquid, and the Fund may\nbe unable to enter into new forward contracts\nor to close out existing contracts. Forward\ncurrency contracts are entered into in the\nover-the-counter market, and the Fund's\nability to profit from a contract will depend\non the willingness and ability of its\ncounterparty to perform its obligations under\nthe contract. Futures Contract Risks: A\nfutures contract is a standardized agreement\nthat calls for the purchase or sale of a\nspecific asset at a specific price at a\nspecific future time, or cash settlement of\nthe terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment\nleverage and may have significant volatility.\nIt is possible that a futures contract\ntransaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the\nFund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There\nis no assurance that a liquid secondary market\non an exchange will exist for any particular\nfutures contract. In the event no such market\nexists, it might not be possible to effect\nclosing transactions, and the Fund will be\nunable to terminate its exposure to the\nfutures contract. There is also a risk of\nimperfect correlation between movements in the\nprices of the futures contract and movements\nin the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be\nunable or unwilling to make timely settlement\npayments, return the Fund's margin, or\notherwise honor its obligations. Geographic\nFocus Risk: The performance of a fund that is\nless diversified across countries or\ngeographic regions will be closely tied to\nmarket, currency, economic, political,\nenvironmental, or regulatory conditions and\ndevelopments in the countries or regions in\nwhich the fund invests, and may be more\nvolatile than the performance of a more\ngeographically-diversified fund. Asia: Certain\nAsian economies have experienced high\ninflation, high unemployment, currency\ndevaluations and restrictions, and over-\nextension of credit. Many Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid growth and\nindustrialization, and there is no assurance\nthat this growth rate will be maintained.\nEconomic events in any one Asian country may\nhave a significant economic effect on the\nentire Asian region, as well as on major\ntrading partners outside Asia. Any adverse\nevent in the Asian markets may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on some or all of\nthe economies of the countries in which the\nFund invests. Many Asian countries are subject\nto political risk, including corruption and\nregional conflict with neighboring countries.\nIn addition, many Asian countries are subject\nto social and labor risks associated with\ndemands for improved political, economic and\nsocial conditions. These risks, among others,\nmay adversely affect the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. Income Risk: The Fund's income\nmay decline due to falling interest rates or\nother factors. Issuers of securities held by\nthe Fund may call or redeem the securities\nduring periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest\nin securities paying lower interest rates. If\nan obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in\nother obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk:\nThe Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy.\nThe structure and composition of the Index\nwill affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to\ntime and may not be identified and corrected\nby the Index Provider for a period of time or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of\nthe Index and the Fund in turn makes similar\nchanges to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by\nthe Fund and its shareholders. The Fund may\nrecognize gains as a result of rebalancing or\nreconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in\nthe Index. The Fund also may be required to\ndistribute any such gains to its shareholders\nto avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Sub-Adviser seeks to\ntrack the 4\n\nTable of Contents performance of the Index (\ni.e., achieve a high degree of correlation\nwith the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs\na number of operating expenses not applicable\nto the Index, and incurs costs in buying and\nselling securities. In addition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund\nor reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track\nthe Index return by investing in fewer than\nall of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index,\npotentially increasing the risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's return and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market,\nstressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an advantageous time or\nprice or at all. Illiquid investments may\ntrade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. If the liquidity\nof the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may\nlead to differences between the market price\nof Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares\nbeing less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the\nFund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a\ntimely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in\npurchasing and selling such investments, may\nbe unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk: As a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of\nportfolio securities than many other funds. To\nthe extent the Fund invests in a relatively\nsmall number of issuers, a decline in the\nmarket value of a particular security held by\nthe Fund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than\nthe values of shares of more diversified\nfunds. The Fund may become diversified for\nperiods of time solely as a result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one\nor more component securities). Swaps Risk: A\nswap is a two-party contract that generally\nobligates the parties to exchange payments\nbased on a specified reference security,\nbasket of securities, security index or index\ncomponent. Swaps can involve greater risks\nthan direct investment in securities because\nswaps may be leveraged and are subject to\ncounterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a\ncounterparty's defaulting on the obligation or\nbankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk\n(i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It\nmay not be possible for the Fund to liquidate\na swap position at an advantageous time or\nprice, which may result in significant losses.\nValuation Risk: Some portfolio holdings,\npotentially a large portion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio, may be valued on the\nbasis of factors other than market quotations.\nThis may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a\nportfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time.

Purchase and\nSale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other\nbroker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation\nUnit transactions are conducted in exchange\nfor the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash.\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased\nand sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Some\ndistributions may be treated as a return of\ncapital for tax purposes. 6 Table of Contents\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.50%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.50%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the\nend of those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $51       $160    $280     $628  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal\nyear, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was\n14% of the average value of its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal Investment Strategy In\nseeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg Global Aggregate ex-USD >$1B:\nCorporate Bond Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that\nthe Fund is not required to purchase all of\nthe securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, State Street Global\nAdvisors Limited (\u201cSSGA LTD\u201d or the \u201cSub-\nAdviser\u201d), the investment sub-adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a\nsubset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Sub-Adviser to be\nin the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions,\nthe Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index and in\nsecurities that the Adviser determines have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments, such as repurchase agreements and\nmoney market funds (including money market\nfunds advised by SSGA Funds Management, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment\nadviser to the Fund). In seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's assets may be concentrated\nin an industry or group of industries, but\nonly to the\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group\nof industries. The Fund may also enter into\nforward currency exchange contracts for\nhedging and/or investment purposes. Swaps and\nfutures contracts may be used by the Fund in\nseeking performance that corresponds to its\nIndex and in managing cash flows. The Index is\ndesigned to be a broad based measure of the\nglobal investment grade, fixed rate, fixed\nincome corporate markets outside the United\nStates. The Index is part of the Bloomberg\nGlobal ex-USD Aggregate Bond Index. The\nsecurities in the Index must have a $1 billion\nUSD equivalent market capitalization\noutstanding and at least 1 year remaining.\nSecurities must be fixed rate, although zero\ncoupon bonds and step-ups are permitted.\nAdditionally, securities must be rated\ninvestment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or better)\nusing the middle rating from Moody's Investors\nService, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc., or S&P\nGlobal Ratings after dropping the highest and\nlowest available ratings. If only two agencies\nrate a security, then the more conservative\n(lower) rating will be used. If only one\nrating agency rates a security, then that one\nrating will be used. Excluded from the Index\nare subordinated debt, convertible securities,\nfloating-rate notes, fixed-rate perpetuals,\nwarrants, inflation-linked bonds, and\nstructured notes. The Index is market\ncapitalization weighted and the securities in\nthe Index are updated on the last business day\nof each month. As of February 28, 2022, there\nwere approximately 880 securities in the\nIndex. As of February 28, 2022, the following\ncountries were represented in the Index:\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China,\nDenmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland,\nItaly, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the\nNetherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, the United Kingdom and the United\nStates. As of February 28, 2022, a significant\nportion of the Fund comprised companies\nlocated in Europe, although this may change\nfrom time to time. As of February 28, 2022, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised\ncompanies in the financial and industrial\nsectors, although this may change from time to\ntime. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund, the\nAdviser or the Sub-Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Index. Principal Risks of\nInvesting in the Fund As with all investments,\nthere are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and\nyou could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other\npublic health issues, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). If the principal on a\ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,\nthe prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by the\nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a\nnon-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial\nreport standards comparable to those in the\nUnited States. Further, such entities and/or\ntheir securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility; differing securities 9\nTable of Contents market structures; higher\ntransaction costs; and various administrative\ndifficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in\nreceiving payment of dividends. To the extent\nunderlying securities held by the Fund trade\non foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be deviations between the\ncurrent price of an underlying security and\nthe last quoted price for the underlying\nsecurity on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums or discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that invest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities traded on foreign\nmarkets may be less liquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded domestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose restrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated in a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks such as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign\nexchange transactions. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Certain countries have recently\nexperienced (or currently are expected to\nexperience) negative interest rates on certain\nfixed-income securities, and similar interest\nrate conditions may be experienced in other\nregions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest\nrates may magnify the Fund's susceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and diminish yield and\nperformance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced\nliquidity. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Currency\nRisk: The value of the Fund's assets may be\naffected favorably or unfavorably by currency\nexchange rates, currency exchange control\nregulations, and delays, restrictions or\nprohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates\nmay have significant volatility, and changes\nin the values of foreign currencies against\nthe U.S. dollar may result in substantial\ndeclines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation,\nwhich may limit both the amounts and types of\nloans and other financial commitments they can\nmake, the interest rates and fees they can\ncharge, the scope of their activities, the\nprices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is\nlargely dependent on the availability and cost\nof capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change or\ndue to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally\nmay cause an adverse impact in a broad range\nof markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally,\nthereby affecting a wide range of financial\ninstitutions and markets. Certain events in\nthe financial sector may cause an unusually\nhigh degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause\ncertain financial services companies to incur\nlarge losses. Securities of financial services\ncompanies may experience a dramatic decline in\nvalue when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of\ntheir assets, take action to raise capital\n(such as the issuance of debt or equity\nsecurities), or cease operations. Credit\nlosses resulting from financial difficulties\nof borrowers and financial losses associated\nwith investment activities can negatively\nimpact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse\neconomic, business or political developments\ncould adversely affect financial institutions\nengaged in mortgage finance or other lending\nor investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Forward\nCurrency Contracts Risk: In a forward currency\ncontract, the Fund agrees to buy in the future\nan amount in one currency in return for\nanother currency, at an exchange rate\ndetermined at the time the contract is entered\ninto. If currency exchange rates have moved\nagainst the Fund's position at the time the\ncontract is settled or closed, the Fund will\nlose money on the contract. There is no limit\non the extent to which exchange rates may move\nagainst the Fund's position. The markets for\ncertain currencies may at times become\nilliquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter\ninto new forward contracts or to close out\nexisting contracts. Forward currency contracts\nare entered into in the over-the-counter\nmarket, and the Fund's ability to profit from\na contract will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations under the contract. Futures\nContract Risks: A futures contract is a\nstandardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract.\nTransactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much\ngreater loss than the principal amount\ninvested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out the futures contract at a favorable\ntime or price. There is no assurance that a 10\nTable of Contents liquid secondary market on\nan exchange will exist for any particular\nfutures contract. In the event no such market\nexists, it might not be possible to effect\nclosing transactions, and the Fund will be\nunable to terminate its exposure to the\nfutures contract. There is also a risk of\nimperfect correlation between movements in the\nprices of the futures contract and movements\nin the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be\nunable or unwilling to make timely settlement\npayments, return the Fund's margin, or\notherwise honor its obligations. Geographic\nFocus Risk: The performance of a fund that is\nless diversified across countries or\ngeographic regions will be closely tied to\nmarket, currency, economic, political,\nenvironmental, or regulatory conditions and\ndevelopments in the countries or regions in\nwhich the fund invests, and may be more\nvolatile than the performance of a more\ngeographically-diversified fund. Europe:\nDeveloped and emerging market countries in\nEurope will be significantly affected by the\nfiscal and monetary controls of the Economic\nand Monetary Union of the European Union\n(\u201cEU\u201d). Changes in regulations on trade,\ndecreasing imports or exports, changes in the\nexchange rate of the euro and recessions among\nEuropean countries may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other\nEuropean countries. In addition, one or more\ncountries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw\nfrom the EU. For example, on January 31, 2020,\nthe United Kingdom formally withdrew from the\nEU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and,\nafter a transition period, left the EU single\nmarket and customs union under the terms of a\nnew trade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to\ntrading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain unresolved\nand subject to further negotiation and\nagreement. The full scope and nature of the\nconsequences of the exit are not at this time\nknown and are unlikely to be known for a\nsignificant period of time. It is also unknown\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Any exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist\nattacks and additional attacks may occur in\nthe future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty\nin financial markets and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. Income Risk: The Fund's\nincome may decline due to falling interest\nrates or other factors. Issuers of securities\nheld by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest\nrates, and the Fund would likely be required\nto reinvest in securities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest\nthe prepayment in other obligations paying\nincome at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy.\nThe structure and composition of the Index\nwill affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to\ntime and may not be identified and corrected\nby the Index Provider for a period of time or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of\nthe Index and the Fund in turn makes similar\nchanges to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by\nthe Fund and its shareholders. The Fund may\nrecognize gains as a result of rebalancing or\nreconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in\nthe Index. The Fund also may be required to\ndistribute any such gains to its shareholders\nto avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Sub-Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance of the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's return may not match the\nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number\nof operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, generally as a result\nof cash flows into or out of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held by the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track\nthe Index return by investing in fewer than\nall of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index,\npotentially increasing the risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's return and that of the\nIndex. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand\nboth for their specific product or service and\nfor industrial sector products in general.\nGovernment regulation, world events, exchange\nrates and economic conditions, technological\ndevelopments and liabilities for environmental\ndamage and general civil 11\n\nTable of Contents liabilities will likewise\naffect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component\nof the industrial sector, can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry\nrely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products\nand services. Thus, the financial condition\nof, and investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which\nare typically under pressure from efforts to\ncontrol the U.S. (and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation securities, a\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are\ncyclical and have occasional sharp price\nmovements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a\nready market, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIf the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could\nresult in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on\ninvestments in any illiquid investments and/or\nthe difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its\ndesired level of exposure to a certain market\nor sector. Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party\ncontract that generally obligates the parties\nto exchange payments based on a specified\nreference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can\ninvolve greater risks than direct investment\nin securities because swaps may be leveraged\nand are subject to counterparty risk (e.g.,\nthe risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and\npricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to\nvalue). It may not be possible for the Fund to\nliquidate a swap position at an advantageous\ntime or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets\nwithin one or more economic sectors or\nindustries, which may change from time to\ntime. Greater investment focus on one or more\nsectors or industries increases the potential\nfor volatility and the risk that events\nnegatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially\ncausing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio holdings, potentially a\nlarge portion of the Fund's investment\nportfolio, may be valued on the basis of\nfactors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or\nreduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding\nwhen market quotations are not readily\navailable. The value established for any\nportfolio holding at a point in time might\ndiffer from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced\nusing market quotations. Portfolio holdings\nthat are valued using techniques other than\nmarket quotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time. Fund Performance The following bar\nchart and table provide an indication of the\nrisks of investing in the Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average\nannual returns for certain time periods\ncompare with the average annual returns of the\nIndex and of a relevant broad-based securities\nindex.

To the extent\nthat a reference in this Prospectus refers to\nthe Adviser, with respect to the Fund, such\nreference should also be read to refer to SSGA\nLTD, where the context requires. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are Richard Darby-Dowman, Paul Brown\nand Peter Spano. Richard Darby-Dowman is a\nVice President and a Portfolio Manager in the\nFixed Income Beta Solutions Team at SSGA LTD.\nHe joined SSGA LTD in 2006. Paul Brown is a\nVice President and a Senior Portfolio Manager\nin the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Team at\nSSGA LTD. He joined SSGA LTD in 2013.

He joined SSGA LTD in 2007.\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Some\ndistributions may be treated as a return of\ncapital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such\nas a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the\nend of those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal\nyear, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was\n15% of the average value of its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal Investment Strategy In\nseeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg Global Treasury ex-US Capped Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling\nstrategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund\nmay purchase a subset of the securities in the\nIndex in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based\non a number of factors, including asset size\nof the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may invest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of securities in the Index\nor may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined\nby the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund generally\ninvests substantially all, but at least 80%,\nof its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that\nthe Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially\nidentical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt securities that are\nnot included in the Index, cash and cash\nequivalents\n\n14\n\nTable of Contents or money market instruments,\nsuch as repurchase agreements and money market\nfunds (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser). The Fund may also enter into\nforward currency exchange contracts for\nhedging and/or investment purposes. Futures\ncontracts may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to its Index and\nin managing cash flows. The Index is designed\nto track the fixed-rate local currency\nsovereign debt of investment grade countries\noutside the United States. The Index includes\ngovernment bonds issued by investment grade\ncountries outside the United States, in local\ncurrencies, that have a remaining maturity of\none year or more and are rated investment\ngrade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or higher using the\nmiddle rating of Moody's Investors Service,\nInc., S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings,\nInc., respectively). Securities included in\nthe Index may include securities that are\nsubject to restrictions on resale under the\nU.S. federal securities laws (\u201crestricted\nsecurities\u201d). Each of the component securities\nin the Index is a constituent of the Bloomberg\nGlobal Treasury ex-US Index. In addition, the\nsecurities in the Index must be fixed-rate and\nhave certain minimum amounts outstanding,\ndepending upon the currency in which the bonds\nare denominated. The Index is calculated by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited using a\nmodified \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d methodology.\nThis design ensures that each constituent\ncountry within the Index is represented in a\nproportion consistent with its percentage with\nrespect to the total market capitalization of\nthe Index. Component securities in each\nconstituent country are represented in a\nproportion consistent with their percentage\nrelative to the other component securities in\nthe constituent country. The securities in the\nIndex are updated on the last business day of\neach month. As of February 28, 2022, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised\ncompanies located in Europe and Japan,\nalthough this may change from time to time. As\nof February 28, 2022, there were approximately\n1,495 securities in the Index. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the\nFund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund\nShares will change in value, and you could\nlose money by investing in the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other\npublic health issues, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). If the principal on a\ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,\nthe prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by the\nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a\nnon-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial\nreport standards comparable to those in the\nUnited States. Further, such entities and/or\ntheir securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility; differing securities 15\nTable of Contents market structures; higher\ntransaction costs; and various administrative\ndifficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in\nreceiving payment of dividends. To the extent\nunderlying securities held by the Fund trade\non foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be deviations between the\ncurrent price of an underlying security and\nthe last quoted price for the underlying\nsecurity on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums or discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that invest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities traded on foreign\nmarkets may be less liquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded domestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose restrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated in a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks such as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign\nexchange transactions. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Certain countries have recently\nexperienced (or currently are expected to\nexperience) negative interest rates on certain\nfixed-income securities, and similar interest\nrate conditions may be experienced in other\nregions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest\nrates may magnify the Fund's susceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and diminish yield and\nperformance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced\nliquidity. Sovereign Debt Obligations Risk:\nInvestments in debt securities issued by\ngovernments or by government agencies and\ninstrumentalities involve the risk that the\ngovernmental entities responsible for\nrepayment may be unable or unwilling to pay\ninterest and repay principal when due. Many\nsovereign debt obligations may be rated below\ninvestment-grade (\u201cjunk\u201d bonds). Any\nrestructuring of a sovereign debt obligation\nheld by the Fund will likely have a\nsignificant adverse effect on the value of the\nobligation. In the event of default of\nsovereign debt, the Fund may be unable to\npursue legal action against the sovereign\nissuer or to realize on collateral securing\nthe debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Currency\nRisk: The value of the Fund's assets may be\naffected favorably or unfavorably by currency\nexchange rates, currency exchange control\nregulations, and delays, restrictions or\nprohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates\nmay have significant volatility, and changes\nin the values of foreign currencies against\nthe U.S. dollar may result in substantial\ndeclines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of investing in emerging\nmarkets include, among others, greater\npolitical and economic instability, greater\nvolatility in currency exchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities markets, possible trade\nbarriers, currency transfer restrictions, a\nmore limited number of potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging market country's\ndependence on revenue from particular\ncommodities or international aid, less\ngovernmental supervision and regulation,\nunavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial\nreporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for\nunfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The\nsecurities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections\nmay limit very significantly the liquidity of\nsecurities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of\nall companies in the country or region. The\nFund may be unable to liquidate its positions\nin such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater\nfor investments in frontier market countries,\nwhich typically have smaller economies or less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries. Forward Currency\nContracts Risk: In a forward currency\ncontract, the Fund agrees to buy in the future\nan amount in one currency in return for\nanother currency, at an exchange rate\ndetermined at the time the contract is entered\ninto. If currency exchange rates have moved\nagainst the Fund's position at the time the\ncontract is settled or closed, the Fund will\nlose money on the contract. There is no limit\non the extent to which exchange rates may move\nagainst the Fund's position. The markets for\ncertain currencies may at times become\nilliquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter\ninto new forward contracts or to close out\nexisting contracts. Forward currency contracts\nare entered into in the over-the-counter\nmarket, and the Fund's ability to profit from\na contract will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations under the contract. 16 Table of\nContents Futures Contract Risks: A futures\ncontract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future\ntime, or cash settlement of the terms of the\ncontract. Transactions in futures contracts\ncan create investment leverage and may have\nsignificant volatility. It is possible that a\nfutures contract transaction will result in a\nmuch greater loss than the principal amount\ninvested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out the futures contract at a favorable\ntime or price. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract. In\nthe event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions,\nand the Fund will be unable to terminate its\nexposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between\nmovements in the prices of the futures\ncontract and movements in the price of the\nunderlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to\nmake timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its\nobligations. Geographic Focus Risk: The\nperformance of a fund that is less diversified\nacross countries or geographic regions will be\nclosely tied to market, currency, economic,\npolitical, environmental, or regulatory\nconditions and developments in the countries\nor regions in which the fund invests, and may\nbe more volatile than the performance of a\nmore geographically-diversified fund. Europe:\nDeveloped and emerging market countries in\nEurope will be significantly affected by the\nfiscal and monetary controls of the Economic\nand Monetary Union of the European Union\n(\u201cEU\u201d). Changes in regulations on trade,\ndecreasing imports or exports, changes in the\nexchange rate of the euro and recessions among\nEuropean countries may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other\nEuropean countries. In addition, one or more\ncountries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw\nfrom the EU. For example, on January 31, 2020,\nthe United Kingdom formally withdrew from the\nEU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and,\nafter a transition period, left the EU single\nmarket and customs union under the terms of a\nnew trade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to\ntrading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain unresolved\nand subject to further negotiation and\nagreement. The full scope and nature of the\nconsequences of the exit are not at this time\nknown and are unlikely to be known for a\nsignificant period of time. It is also unknown\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Any exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist\nattacks and additional attacks may occur in\nthe future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty\nin financial markets and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. Japan: The growth of\nJapan's economy has historically lagged that\nof its Asian neighbors and other major\ndeveloped economies. The Japanese economy is\nheavily dependent on international trade and\nhas been adversely affected by trade tariffs,\nother protectionist measures, competition from\nemerging economies and the economic conditions\nof its trading partners. China has become an\nimportant trading partner with Japan, yet the\ncountries' political relationship has become\nstrained. Should political tension increase,\nit could adversely affect the economy,\nespecially the export sector, and destabilize\nthe region as a whole. Japan also remains\nheavily dependent on oil imports, and higher\ncommodity prices could therefore have a\nnegative impact on the economy. The Japanese\nyen has fluctuated widely at times and any\nincrease in its value may cause a decline in\nexports that could weaken the Japanese\neconomy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in\nthe currency markets to attempt to maintain or\nreduce the value of the yen. Japanese\nintervention in the currency markets could\ncause the value of the yen to fluctuate\nsharply and unpredictably and could cause\nlosses to investors. Japan has an aging\nworkforce and has experienced a significant\npopulation decline in recent years. Japan's\nlabor market appears to be undergoing\nfundamental structural changes, as a labor\nmarket traditionally accustomed to lifetime\nemployment adjusts to meet the need for\nincreased labor mobility, which may adversely\naffect Japan's economic competitiveness.\nNatural disasters, such as earthquakes,\nvolcanoes, typhoons or tsunamis, could occur\nin Japan or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Japanese economy and, in\nturn, the Fund. Income Risk: The Fund's income\nmay decline due to falling interest rates or\nother factors. Issuers of securities held by\nthe Fund may call or redeem the securities\nduring periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest\nin securities paying lower interest rates. If\nan obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in\nother obligations paying income at lower\nrates. 17 Table of Contents Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy,\nattempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of\nthe current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising\nthe Index. This differs from an actively-\nmanaged fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio managed using an active\ninvestment strategy. The structure and\ncomposition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index\nand, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with\nits methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the Fund\nand its shareholders. When there are changes\nmade to the component securities of the Index\nand the Fund in turn makes similar changes to\nits portfolio, any transaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains\nas a result of rebalancing or reconstituting\nits securities holdings to reflect changes in\nthe securities included in the Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to distribute any such\ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse\nfederal income tax consequences. While the\nAdviser seeks to track the performance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The\nFund incurs a number of operating expenses not\napplicable to the Index, and incurs costs in\nbuying and selling securities. In addition,\nthe Fund may not be fully invested at times,\ngenerally as a result of cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or reserves of cash held by\nthe Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing\nin fewer than all of the securities in the\nIndex, or in some securities not included in\nthe Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that\nof the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIf the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could\nresult in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on\ninvestments in any illiquid investments and/or\nthe difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its\ndesired level of exposure to a certain market\nor sector. Non-Diversification Risk: As a\n\u201cnon-diversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively small number of\nissuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may\naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund\nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome diversified for periods of time solely\nas a result of tracking the Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Restricted Securities Risk: The\nFund may hold securities that have not been\nregistered for sale to the public under the\nU.S. federal securities laws. There can be no\nassurance that a trading market will exist at\nany time for any particular restricted\nsecurity. Limitations on the resale of these\nsecurities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from\ndisposing of them promptly at reasonable\nprices. The Fund may have to bear the expense\nof registering the securities for resale and\nthe risk of substantial delays in effecting\nthe registration. Also, restricted securities\nmay be difficult to value because market\nquotations may not be readily available, and\nthe securities may have significant\nvolatility. Valuation Risk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of the\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time. Fund Performance The following bar\nchart and table provide an indication of the\nrisks of investing in the Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average\nannual returns for certain time periods\ncompare with the average annual returns of the\nIndex and of a relevant broad-based securities\nindex.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are James Kramer,\nJoanna Madden and Orhan Imer. James Kramer is\na Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1996. Joanna Madden is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed\nIncome Beta Solutions Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2003. Orhan Imer, CFA, Ph.D., is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2017. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs.\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents Tax Information The Fund's\ndistributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income and/or capital gains, unless\nyou are investing through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Some distributions may be\ntreated as a return of capital for tax\npurposes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other\nFinancial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund\nShares through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), the\nAdviser or its affiliates may pay the\nfinancial intermediary for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund, including educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeBloomberg Short Term International\nTreasury Bond ETF (formerly, SPDR \u00aeBloomberg\nBarclays Short Term International Treasury\nBond ETF)\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Bloomberg Short Term               \n  International                               \n  Treasury Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to     \n  provide                                     \n  investment results that, before fees and    \n  expenses,                                   \n  correspond generally to the price and       \n  yield                                       \n  performance of an index that tracks the     \n  short-term                                  \n  (1-3 year remaining maturity) fixed rate,   \n  investment grade debt issued by foreign     \n  governments of investment grade countries.  \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the\nend of those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal\nyear, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was\n64% of the average value of its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal Investment Strategy In\nseeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg 1-3 Year Global Treasury ex-US\nCapped Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the\nFund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index and in\nsecurities that the Adviser determines have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents or money market instruments,\nsuch as repurchase agreements and money market\nfunds (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser). The Fund may also enter into\nforward currency exchange contracts for\nhedging and/or investment purposes. Futures\ncontracts may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to its Index and\nin managing cash flows. The Index is designed\nto measure the performance of fixed-rate local\ncurrency sovereign debt of investment grade\ncountries outside the United States that have\nremaining maturities of one to three years.\nThe Index includes government bonds issued by\ninvestment grade countries outside the United\nStates, in local currencies, that have\nremaining maturities of one to three years and\nare rated investment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or\nhigher using the middle rating of Moody's\nInvestors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings\nand Fitch Ratings, Inc., respectively).\nSecurities included in the Index may include\nsecurities that are subject to restrictions on\nresale under the U.S. federal securities laws\n(\u201crestricted securities\u201d). Each of the\ncomponent securities in the Index is a\nconstituent of the Bloomberg Global Treasury\nex-US Index. In addition, the securities in\nthe Index must be fixed-rate and have certain\nminimum amounts outstanding, depending upon\nthe currency in which the bonds are\ndenominated. The Index is calculated by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited using a\nmodified \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d methodology.\nThis design ensures that each constituent\ncountry within the Index is represented in a\nproportion consistent with its percentage with\nrespect to the total market capitalization of\nthe Index. Component securities in each\nconstituent country are represented in a\nproportion consistent with their percentage\nrelative to the other component securities in\nthe constituent country. The securities in the\nIndex are updated on the last business day of\neach month. As of February 28, 2022, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised\ncompanies located in Europe and Japan,\nalthough this may change from time to time. As\nof February 28, 2022, there were approximately\n294 securities in the Index and the dollar-\nweighted average maturity of the securities in\nthe Index was 1.90 years. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the\nFund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund\nShares will change in value, and you could\nlose money by investing in the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other\npublic health issues, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). If the principal on a\ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,\nthe prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by the\nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a\nnon-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial\nreport standards 22 Table of Contents\ncomparable to those in the United States.\nFurther, such entities and/or their securities\nmay be subject to risks associated with\ncurrency controls; expropriation; changes in\ntax policy; greater market volatility;\ndiffering securities market structures; higher\ntransaction costs; and various administrative\ndifficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in\nreceiving payment of dividends. To the extent\nunderlying securities held by the Fund trade\non foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be deviations between the\ncurrent price of an underlying security and\nthe last quoted price for the underlying\nsecurity on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums or discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that invest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities traded on foreign\nmarkets may be less liquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded domestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose restrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated in a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks such as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign\nexchange transactions. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Certain countries have recently\nexperienced (or currently are expected to\nexperience) negative interest rates on certain\nfixed-income securities, and similar interest\nrate conditions may be experienced in other\nregions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest\nrates may magnify the Fund's susceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and diminish yield and\nperformance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced\nliquidity. Sovereign Debt Obligations Risk:\nInvestments in debt securities issued by\ngovernments or by government agencies and\ninstrumentalities involve the risk that the\ngovernmental entities responsible for\nrepayment may be unable or unwilling to pay\ninterest and repay principal when due. Many\nsovereign debt obligations may be rated below\ninvestment-grade (\u201cjunk\u201d bonds). Any\nrestructuring of a sovereign debt obligation\nheld by the Fund will likely have a\nsignificant adverse effect on the value of the\nobligation. In the event of default of\nsovereign debt, the Fund may be unable to\npursue legal action against the sovereign\nissuer or to realize on collateral securing\nthe debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Currency\nRisk: The value of the Fund's assets may be\naffected favorably or unfavorably by currency\nexchange rates, currency exchange control\nregulations, and delays, restrictions or\nprohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates\nmay have significant volatility, and changes\nin the values of foreign currencies against\nthe U.S. dollar may result in substantial\ndeclines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of investing in emerging\nmarkets include, among others, greater\npolitical and economic instability, greater\nvolatility in currency exchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities markets, possible trade\nbarriers, currency transfer restrictions, a\nmore limited number of potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging market country's\ndependence on revenue from particular\ncommodities or international aid, less\ngovernmental supervision and regulation,\nunavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial\nreporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for\nunfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The\nsecurities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections\nmay limit very significantly the liquidity of\nsecurities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of\nall companies in the country or region. The\nFund may be unable to liquidate its positions\nin such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater\nfor investments in frontier market countries,\nwhich typically have smaller economies or less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries. Forward Currency\nContracts Risk: In a forward currency\ncontract, the Fund agrees to buy in the future\nan amount in one currency in return for\nanother currency, at an exchange rate\ndetermined at the time the contract is entered\ninto. If currency exchange rates have moved\nagainst the Fund's position at the time the\ncontract is settled or closed, the Fund will\nlose money on the contract. There is no limit\non the extent to which exchange rates may move\nagainst the Fund's position. The markets for\ncertain currencies may at times become\nilliquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter\ninto new forward contracts or to close out\nexisting contracts. Forward currency contracts\nare entered into in the over-the-counter\nmarket, and the Fund's ability to profit from\na contract will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations under the contract. 23 Table of\nContents Futures Contract Risks: A futures\ncontract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future\ntime, or cash settlement of the terms of the\ncontract. Transactions in futures contracts\ncan create investment leverage and may have\nsignificant volatility. It is possible that a\nfutures contract transaction will result in a\nmuch greater loss than the principal amount\ninvested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out the futures contract at a favorable\ntime or price. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract. In\nthe event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions,\nand the Fund will be unable to terminate its\nexposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between\nmovements in the prices of the futures\ncontract and movements in the price of the\nunderlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to\nmake timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its\nobligations. Geographic Focus Risk: The\nperformance of a fund that is less diversified\nacross countries or geographic regions will be\nclosely tied to market, currency, economic,\npolitical, environmental, or regulatory\nconditions and developments in the countries\nor regions in which the fund invests, and may\nbe more volatile than the performance of a\nmore geographically-diversified fund. Europe:\nDeveloped and emerging market countries in\nEurope will be significantly affected by the\nfiscal and monetary controls of the Economic\nand Monetary Union of the European Union\n(\u201cEU\u201d). Changes in regulations on trade,\ndecreasing imports or exports, changes in the\nexchange rate of the euro and recessions among\nEuropean countries may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other\nEuropean countries. In addition, one or more\ncountries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw\nfrom the EU. For example, on January 31, 2020,\nthe United Kingdom formally withdrew from the\nEU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and,\nafter a transition period, left the EU single\nmarket and customs union under the terms of a\nnew trade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to\ntrading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain unresolved\nand subject to further negotiation and\nagreement. The full scope and nature of the\nconsequences of the exit are not at this time\nknown and are unlikely to be known for a\nsignificant period of time. It is also unknown\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Any exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist\nattacks and additional attacks may occur in\nthe future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty\nin financial markets and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. Japan: The growth of\nJapan's economy has historically lagged that\nof its Asian neighbors and other major\ndeveloped economies. The Japanese economy is\nheavily dependent on international trade and\nhas been adversely affected by trade tariffs,\nother protectionist measures, competition from\nemerging economies and the economic conditions\nof its trading partners. China has become an\nimportant trading partner with Japan, yet the\ncountries' political relationship has become\nstrained. Should political tension increase,\nit could adversely affect the economy,\nespecially the export sector, and destabilize\nthe region as a whole. Japan also remains\nheavily dependent on oil imports, and higher\ncommodity prices could therefore have a\nnegative impact on the economy. The Japanese\nyen has fluctuated widely at times and any\nincrease in its value may cause a decline in\nexports that could weaken the Japanese\neconomy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in\nthe currency markets to attempt to maintain or\nreduce the value of the yen. Japanese\nintervention in the currency markets could\ncause the value of the yen to fluctuate\nsharply and unpredictably and could cause\nlosses to investors. Japan has an aging\nworkforce and has experienced a significant\npopulation decline in recent years. Japan's\nlabor market appears to be undergoing\nfundamental structural changes, as a labor\nmarket traditionally accustomed to lifetime\nemployment adjusts to meet the need for\nincreased labor mobility, which may adversely\naffect Japan's economic competitiveness.\nNatural disasters, such as earthquakes,\nvolcanoes, typhoons or tsunamis, could occur\nin Japan or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Japanese economy and, in\nturn, the Fund. Income Risk: The Fund's income\nmay decline due to falling interest rates or\nother factors. Issuers of securities held by\nthe Fund may call or redeem the securities\nduring periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest\nin securities paying lower interest rates. If\nan obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in\nother obligations paying income at lower\nrates. 24 Table of Contents Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy,\nattempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of\nthe current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising\nthe Index. This differs from an actively-\nmanaged fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio managed using an active\ninvestment strategy. The structure and\ncomposition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index\nand, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with\nits methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the Fund\nand its shareholders. When there are changes\nmade to the component securities of the Index\nand the Fund in turn makes similar changes to\nits portfolio, any transaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains\nas a result of rebalancing or reconstituting\nits securities holdings to reflect changes in\nthe securities included in the Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to distribute any such\ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse\nfederal income tax consequences. While the\nAdviser seeks to track the performance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The\nFund incurs a number of operating expenses not\napplicable to the Index, and incurs costs in\nbuying and selling securities. In addition,\nthe Fund may not be fully invested at times,\ngenerally as a result of cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or reserves of cash held by\nthe Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing\nin fewer than all of the securities in the\nIndex, or in some securities not included in\nthe Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that\nof the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIf the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could\nresult in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on\ninvestments in any illiquid investments and/or\nthe difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its\ndesired level of exposure to a certain market\nor sector. Non-Diversification Risk: As a\n\u201cnon-diversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively small number of\nissuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may\naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund\nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome diversified for periods of time solely\nas a result of tracking the Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Restricted Securities Risk: The\nFund may hold securities that have not been\nregistered for sale to the public under the\nU.S. federal securities laws. There can be no\nassurance that a trading market will exist at\nany time for any particular restricted\nsecurity. Limitations on the resale of these\nsecurities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from\ndisposing of them promptly at reasonable\nprices. The Fund may have to bear the expense\nof registering the securities for resale and\nthe risk of substantial delays in effecting\nthe registration. Also, restricted securities\nmay be difficult to value because market\nquotations may not be readily available, and\nthe securities may have significant\nvolatility. Valuation Risk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of the\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time. 25\n\nTable of Contents Fund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and table provide an\nindication of the risks of investing in the\nFund by showing changes in the Fund's\nperformance from year to year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average\nannual returns of the Index and of a relevant\nbroad-based securities index.

Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are James Kramer,\nJoanna Madden and Orhan Imer. James Kramer is\na Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1996. Joanna Madden is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed\nIncome Beta Solutions Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2003. Orhan Imer, CFA, Ph.D., is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2017. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary\n\n26\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Some\ndistributions may be treated as a return of\ncapital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such\nas a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n27\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeFTSE International Government Inflation-\nProtected Bond ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR FTSE International Government      \n  Inflation-Protected Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)   \n  seeks to                                    \n  provide investment results that, before     \n  fees and                                    \n  expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  price and                                   \n  yield performance of an index that tracks   \n  the                                         \n  inflation protected sector of the global    \n  bond                                        \n  market outside the United States.           \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.50%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.50%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the\nend of those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $51       $160    $280     $628  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal\nyear, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was\n20% of the average value of its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal Investment Strategy In\nseeking to track the performance of the FTSE\nInternational Inflation-Linked Securities\nSelect Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the\nFund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index and in\nsecurities that the Adviser determines have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments, such as repurchase agreements and\nmoney market funds (including money market\nfunds advised by the Adviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an industry or\n\n28\n\nTable of Contents group of industries, but\nonly to the extent that the Index concentrates\nin a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Fund may use derivatives,\nincluding credit default swaps and credit\ndefault index swaps, to obtain investment\nexposure that the Adviser expects to correlate\nclosely with the Index, or a portion of the\nIndex, and in managing cash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure the total return\nperformance of inflation-linked bonds outside\nthe United States with fixed-rate coupon\npayments that are linked to an inflation\nindex. Inflation-protected public obligations\nof the inflation-linked government bond\nmarkets of developed and emerging market\ncountries, commonly known in the United States\nas TIPS, are securities issued by such\ngovernments that are designed to provide\ninflation protection to investors. The Index\nincludes government debt (direct obligations\nof the issuer country) but does not include\nquasi-government debt or corporate debt. To be\nincluded in the Index, bonds must be linked to\nan inflation index and (i) meet a country-\nspecific minimum issue size, depending on the\ncurrency in which the issue is denominated;\n(ii) have a fixed-rate stated coupon; (iii)\nhave at least one year remaining to maturity\nat the Index rebalancing date; (iv) settle on\nor before the Index rebalancing date; and (v)\nbe rated at least C by S&P Global Ratings\n(\u201cS&P\u201d) or at least Ca by Moody's Investors\nService, Inc. (excluding defaulted issuers).\nSecurities included in the Index may include\nsecurities that are subject to restrictions on\nresale under the U.S. federal securities laws\n(\u201crestricted securities\u201d). The Index is a\nmarket-value weight, capped total return\nindex, in which the maximum market\ncapitalization-based weights of each\nindividual country in the Index cannot exceed\n22.5% of the total Index weight. The total\nmarket weights of countries with more than\n4.6% market weight in the Index cannot\ncollectively exceed 45% of the total Index\nweight and the number of countries with more\nthan 4.6% market weight in the Index can be no\nless than five. If the combined weights of\neach country with more than 4.6% market weight\nexceeds 45% of the total Index weight, then\nthe weights of those countries are reduced in\nproportion to each country's market\ncapitalizations until they sum to 45%, and the\nweights of the remaining smaller countries are\nincreased in proportion to each country's\nmarket capitalizations by the same amount.\nAfter the country weights are determined,\nconstituents within each country are assigned\nweights in proportion to their market\ncapitalization. When an issuer defaults, is\nassigned a D rating by S&P, or enters into\nChapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection\nin the U.S. (or equivalent in its local\nmarket), its bonds remain in the Index until\nthe end of the month. The Index is rebalanced\nmonthly, on the last day of the month.\nCountries covered in the Index as of February\n28, 2022 comprised: Australia, Brazil, Canada,\nChile, Colombia, France, Germany, Israel,\nItaly, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South\nAfrica, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and\nthe United Kingdom, although this may change\nfrom time to time. As of February 28, 2022, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised\ncompanies located in Europe and the United\nKingdom, although this may change from time to\ntime. As of February 28, 2022, there were\napproximately 179 securities in the Index. The\nIndex is sponsored by FTSE Russell (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Index. Principal Risks of\nInvesting in the Fund As with all investments,\nthere are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and\nyou could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other\npublic health issues, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate 29\nTable of Contents environment heightens the\nrisks associated with rising interest rates.\nDuring periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the\nFund may have a negative yield (i.e., it may\nlose money on an operating basis). If the\nprincipal on a debt obligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the prepayments of principal\nmay have to be reinvested in obligations\npaying interest at lower rates. During periods\nof falling interest rates, the income received\nby the Fund may decline. Changes in interest\nrates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a\nnon-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial\nreport standards comparable to those in the\nUnited States. Further, such entities and/or\ntheir securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility; differing securities market\nstructures; higher transaction costs; and\nvarious administrative difficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and settling portfolio\ntransactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges\nthat are closed when the exchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is open, there may be\ndeviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed\nforeign market. These deviations could result\nin the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts\ngreater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on\nforeign markets may be less liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities traded domestically.\nForeign governments may impose restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated in a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks such as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign\nexchange transactions. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Certain countries have recently\nexperienced (or currently are expected to\nexperience) negative interest rates on certain\nfixed-income securities, and similar interest\nrate conditions may be experienced in other\nregions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest\nrates may magnify the Fund's susceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and diminish yield and\nperformance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced\nliquidity. Inflation-Indexed Securities Risk:\nThe principal amount of an inflation-indexed\nsecurity typically increases with inflation\nand decreases with deflation, as measured by a\nspecified index. It is possible that, in a\nperiod of declining inflation rates, the Fund\ncould receive at maturity less than the\ninitial principal amount of an inflation-\nindexed security. Changes in the values of\ninflation-indexed securities may be difficult\nto predict, and it is possible that an\ninvestment in such securities will have an\neffect different from that anticipated.\nSovereign Debt Obligations Risk: Investments\nin debt securities issued by governments or by\ngovernment agencies and instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that the governmental\nentities responsible for repayment may be\nunable or unwilling to pay interest and repay\nprincipal when due. Many sovereign debt\nobligations may be rated below investment-\ngrade (\u201cjunk\u201d bonds). Any restructuring of a\nsovereign debt obligation held by the Fund\nwill likely have a significant adverse effect\non the value of the obligation. In the event\nof default of sovereign debt, the Fund may be\nunable to pursue legal action against the\nsovereign issuer or to realize on collateral\nsecuring the debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares\nmay be bought and sold in the secondary market\nat market prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Below\nInvestment-Grade Securities Risk: Lower-\nquality debt securities (\u201chigh yield\u201d or\n\u201cjunk\u201d bonds) are considered predominantly\nspeculative, and can involve a substantially\ngreater risk of default than higher quality\ndebt securities. Issuers of lower-quality debt\nsecurities may have substantially greater risk\nof insolvency or bankruptcy than issuers of\nhigher-quality debt securities. They can be\nilliquid, and their values can have\nsignificant volatility and may decline\nsignificantly over short periods of time.\nLower-quality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or\nthe market or economy in general. 30 Table of\nContents Currency Risk: The value of the\nFund's assets may be affected favorably or\nunfavorably by currency exchange rates,\ncurrency exchange control regulations, and\ndelays, restrictions or prohibitions on the\nrepatriation of foreign currencies. Foreign\ncurrency exchange rates may have significant\nvolatility, and changes in the values of\nforeign currencies against the U.S. dollar may\nresult in substantial declines in the values\nof the Fund's assets denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets include, among\nothers, greater political and economic\ninstability, greater volatility in currency\nexchange rates, less developed securities\nmarkets, possible trade barriers, currency\ntransfer restrictions, a more limited number\nof potential buyers and issuers, an emerging\nmarket country's dependence on revenue from\nparticular commodities or international aid,\nless governmental supervision and regulation,\nunavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial\nreporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for\nunfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The\nsecurities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections\nmay limit very significantly the liquidity of\nsecurities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of\nall companies in the country or region. The\nFund may be unable to liquidate its positions\nin such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater\nfor investments in frontier market countries,\nwhich typically have smaller economies or less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries. Geographic Focus\nRisk: The performance of a fund that is less\ndiversified across countries or geographic\nregions will be closely tied to market,\ncurrency, economic, political, environmental,\nor regulatory conditions and developments in\nthe countries or regions in which the fund\ninvests, and may be more volatile than the\nperformance of a more geographically-\ndiversified fund. Europe: Developed and\nemerging market countries in Europe will be\nsignificantly affected by the fiscal and\nmonetary controls of the Economic and Monetary\nUnion of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). Changes in\nregulations on trade, decreasing imports or\nexports, changes in the exchange rate of the\neuro and recessions among European countries\nmay have a significant adverse effect on the\neconomies of other European countries. In\naddition, one or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the EU. For\nexample, on January 31, 2020, the United\nKingdom formally withdrew from the EU\n(commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and, after\na transition period, left the EU single market\nand customs union under the terms of a new\ntrade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to\ntrading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain unresolved\nand subject to further negotiation and\nagreement. The full scope and nature of the\nconsequences of the exit are not at this time\nknown and are unlikely to be known for a\nsignificant period of time. It is also unknown\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Any exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist\nattacks and additional attacks may occur in\nthe future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty\nin financial markets and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. United Kingdom: The United\nKingdom has one of the largest economies in\nEurope, and the United States and other\nEuropean countries are substantial trading\npartners of the United Kingdom. As a result,\nthe British economy may be impacted by changes\nto the economic condition of the United States\nand other European countries. The British\neconomy, along with certain other EU\neconomies, experienced a significant economic\nslowdown during the recent financial crisis,\nand certain British financial institutions\nsuffered significant losses, were severely\nunder-capitalized and required government\nintervention to survive. The British economy\nrelies heavily on the export of financial\nservices to the United States and other\nEuropean countries and, therefore, a prolonged\nslowdown in the financial services sector may\nhave a negative impact on the British economy.\nContinued governmental involvement or control\nin certain sectors may stifle competition in\ncertain sectors or cause adverse effects on\neconomic growth. On January 31, 2020, the\nUnited Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU\n(commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and, after\na transition period, left the EU single market\nand customs union under the terms of a new\ntrade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to\ntrading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain unresolved\nand subject to further negotiation and\nagreement. There is still considerable\nuncertainty relating to the potential\nconsequences associated with the exit and\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the 31 Table of Contents likelihood\nof other countries also departing the EU. Any\nexits from the EU, or the possibility of such\nexits, may have a significant impact on the\nUnited Kingdom, Europe, and global economies,\nwhich may result in increased volatility and\nilliquidity, new legal and regulatory\nuncertainties and potentially lower economic\ngrowth for these economies that could\npotentially have an adverse effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. In addition,\nthe United Kingdom has been a target of\nterrorism in the past. Acts of terrorism in\nthe United Kingdom or against British\ninterests abroad may cause uncertainty in the\nBritish financial markets and adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. Income Risk: The Fund's\nincome may decline due to falling interest\nrates or other factors. Issuers of securities\nheld by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest\nrates, and the Fund would likely be required\nto reinvest in securities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest\nthe prepayment in other obligations paying\nincome at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy.\nThe structure and composition of the Index\nwill affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to\ntime and may not be identified and corrected\nby the Index Provider for a period of time or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of\nthe Index and the Fund in turn makes similar\nchanges to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by\nthe Fund and its shareholders. The Fund may\nrecognize gains as a result of rebalancing or\nreconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in\nthe Index. The Fund also may be required to\ndistribute any such gains to its shareholders\nto avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track\nthe performance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of correlation with the Index),\nthe Fund's return may not match the return of\nthe Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, generally as a result\nof cash flows into or out of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held by the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track\nthe Index return by investing in fewer than\nall of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index,\npotentially increasing the risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's return and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market,\nstressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an advantageous time or\nprice or at all. Illiquid investments may\ntrade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. If the liquidity\nof the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may\nlead to differences between the market price\nof Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares\nbeing less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the\nFund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a\ntimely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in\npurchasing and selling such investments, may\nbe unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk: As a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of\nportfolio securities than many other funds. To\nthe extent the Fund invests in a relatively\nsmall number of issuers, a decline in the\nmarket value of a particular security held by\nthe Fund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than\nthe values of shares of more diversified\nfunds. The Fund may become diversified for\nperiods of time solely as a result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one\nor more component securities). Restricted\nSecurities Risk: The Fund may hold securities\nthat have not been registered for sale to the\npublic under the U.S. federal securities laws.\nThere can be no assurance that a trading\nmarket will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Limitations on\nthe resale of these securities may have an\nadverse effect on their marketability, and may\nprevent the Fund from disposing of them\npromptly at reasonable prices. The Fund may\nhave to bear the expense of registering the\nsecurities for resale and the risk of\nsubstantial delays in effecting the\nregistration. Also, restricted securities may\nbe difficult to value because market\nquotations may not be readily available, and\nthe securities may have significant\nvolatility. 32\n\nTable of Contents Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-\nparty contract that generally obligates the\nparties to exchange payments based on a\nspecified reference security, basket of\nsecurities, security index or index component.\nSwaps can involve greater risks than direct\ninvestment in securities because swaps may be\nleveraged and are subject to counterparty risk\n(e.g., the risk of a counterparty's defaulting\non the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk\nand pricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult\nto value). It may not be possible for the Fund\nto liquidate a swap position at an\nadvantageous time or price, which may result\nin significant losses. Valuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings, potentially a large\nportion of the Fund's investment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other\nthan market quotations. This may occur more\noften in times of market turmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are multiple methods that can\nbe used to value a portfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from\nwhat would be produced using a different\nmethodology or if it had been priced using\nmarket quotations. Portfolio holdings that are\nvalued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time. Fund Performance The following bar\nchart and table provide an indication of the\nrisks of investing in the Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average\nannual returns for certain time periods\ncompare with the average annual returns of the\nIndex and of a relevant broad-based securities\nindex. The Fund's past performance (before and\nafter taxes) is not necessarily an indication\nof how the Fund will perform in the\nfuture.Updated performance information is\navailable by calling 1-866-787-2257or visiting\nour website at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs.\nAnnual Total Returns (years ended 12/31)\nHighest Quarterly Return: 9.29% ( Q4, 2020)\nLowest Quarterly Return:- 11.23% ( Q1, 2020)\n\nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/21) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes. Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective February 12, 2016 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the DB Global\nGovernment ex-U.S. Inflation-Linked Bond\nCapped Index (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d)\nto the FTSE International Inflation-Linked\nSecurities Select Index, consistent with a\nchange in the Fund's principal investment\nstrategy to track the performance of the\ncurrent index. Performance of the Fund prior\nto the Benchmark Index Change Date is\ntherefore based on the Fund's investment\nstrategy to track the Previous Benchmark\nIndex.\n                                              \n                        One     Five   Ten    \n                        Year    Years  Years  \n  Return Before Taxes   -3.68%  3.46%  1.90%  \n  Return After Taxes    -5.36%  2.64%  1.15%  \n  on Distributions                            \n  Return After Taxes                          \n  on Distributions and  -2.11%  2.36%  1.19%  \n  Sale of                                     \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  FTSE International                          \n  Inflation-Linked                            \n  Securities                                  \n  Select Index/DB                             \n  Global Government                           \n  ex-U.S.               -3.10%  4.03%  2.47%  \n  Inflation-Linked                            \n  Bond Capped Index1,2                        \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for fees,                         \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n  Bloomberg Global                            \n  Aggregate Bond Index                        \n  (reflects no          -4.71%  3.36%  1.77%  \n  deduction for fees,                         \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     Index for periods beginning on the       \n     Benchmark Index Change Date and the      \n     Previous Benchmark Index for periods     \n     prior to the Benchmark Index Change      \n     Date.                                    \n     Prior to May 31, 2018, the FTSE          \n     International Inflation-Linked           \n     Securities Select Index was named the    \n  1  Citi International Inflation-Linked      \n  2  Securities Select Index.                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n33\n\nTable of Contents Portfolio Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are James Kramer, Cynthia Moy and\nOrhan Imer. James Kramer is a Vice President\nof the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager\nin the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He\njoined the Adviser in 1996. Cynthia Moy is a\nPrincipal of the Adviser and a Portfolio\nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions\nGroup. She joined the Adviser in 2007. Orhan\nImer, CFA, Ph.D., is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nFixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined\nthe Adviser in 2017. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Some\ndistributions may be treated as a return of\ncapital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such\nas a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n34 Table of Contents Additional Strategies\nInformation Principal Strategies General .\nPlease see each Fund's \u201cThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy\u201d section under \u201cFund\nSummaries\u201d above for a complete discussion of\neach Fund's principal investment strategies. A\nFund may invest in various types of securities\nand engage in various investment techniques\nwhich are not the principal focus of the Fund\nand therefore are not described in this\nProspectus. These securities, techniques and\npractices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional\nInformation (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain\nfree of charge by contacting shareholder\nservices (see the back cover of this\nProspectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of\neach Fund's Index as closely as possible\n(i.e., obtain a high degree of correlation\nwith the Index). A number of factors may\naffect a Fund's ability to achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with its Index, and\nthere can be no guarantee that a Fund will\nachieve a high degree of correlation. For\nexample, a Fund may not be able to achieve a\nhigh degree of correlation with its Index when\nthere are practical difficulties or\nsubstantial costs involved in compiling a\nportfolio of securities to follow the Index,\nwhen a security in the Index becomes\ntemporarily illiquid, unavailable or less\nliquid, or legal restrictions exist that\nprohibit the Fund from investing in a security\nin the Index. The Adviser will utilize a\nsampling strategy in managing the Funds.\nSampling means that the Adviser uses\nquantitative analysis to select securities,\nincluding securities in the Index, outside of\nthe Index and derivatives that have a similar\ninvestment profile as the relevant Index in\nterms of key risk factors, performance\nattributes and other economic characteristics.\nThese include industry weightings, market\ncapitalization, and other financial\ncharacteristics of securities. The quantity of\nholdings in a Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nIn addition, from time to time, securities are\nadded to or removed from each Index. The\nAdviser may sell securities that are\nrepresented in an Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in an\nIndex, in anticipation of their removal from\nor addition to an Index. Further, the Adviser\nmay choose to overweight securities in an\nIndex, purchase or sell securities not in an\nIndex, or utilize various combinations of\nother available techniques, in seeking to\ntrack an Index. Each Fund has adopted a non-\nfundamental investment policy to invest at\nleast 80% of its respective net assets, plus\nthe amount of borrowings for investment\npurposes, in investments suggested by its\nname, measured at the time of investment. A\nFund will provide shareholders with at least\n60 days' notice prior to any change in this\nnon-fundamental 80% investment policy. The\nBoard of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201cBoard\u201d)\nmay change a Fund's investment strategy, Index\nand other policies without shareholder\napproval, except as otherwise indicated in\nthis Prospectus or in the SAI. The Board may\nalso change a Fund's investment objective\nwithout shareholder approval. Non-Principal\nStrategies Certain Other Investments . Each\nFund may invest in structured notes (notes on\nwhich the amount of principal repayment and\ninterest payments are based on the movement of\none or more specified factors such as the\nmovement of a particular security or index),\nswaps, options and futures contracts. Swaps,\noptions and futures contracts and structured\nnotes may be used by a Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to its Index and\nin managing cash flows. Temporary Defensive\nPositions . In certain situations or market\nconditions, a Fund may temporarily depart from\nits normal investment policies and strategies,\nprovided that the alternative is consistent\nwith the Fund's investment objective and is in\nthe best interest of the Fund. For example, a\nFund may make larger than normal investments\nin derivatives to maintain exposure to its\nIndex if it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . Each\nFund may borrow money from a bank as permitted\nby the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing\nstatute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund, but only for\ntemporary or emergency purposes. Each Fund may\nalso invest in reverse repurchase agreements,\nwhich are considered borrowings under the 1940\nAct. Although the 1940 Act presently allows a\nFund to borrow from any bank (including\npledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets)\nin an amount up to 33 1/ 3% of its total\nassets (not including temporary borrowings not\nin excess of 5% of its total assets), and\nthere is no percentage limit on Fund assets\nthat can be used in connection with reverse\nrepurchase agreements, under normal\ncircumstances any borrowings by a Fund will\nnot exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. 35\nTable of Contents Lending of Securities . Each\nFund may lend its portfolio securities in an\namount not to exceed 40% of the value of its\nnet assets via a securities lending program\nthrough its securities lending agent, State\nStreet Bank and Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d\nor the \u201cLending Agent\u201d), to brokers, dealers\nand other financial institutions desiring to\nborrow securities to complete transactions and\nfor other purposes. A securities lending\nprogram allows a Fund to receive a portion of\nthe income generated by lending its securities\nand investing the respective collateral. A\nFund will receive collateral for each loaned\nsecurity which is at least equal to the market\nvalue of that security, marked to market each\ntrading day. To the extent a Fund receives\ncash collateral, as of the date of this\nProspectus, the Adviser expects to invest such\ncash collateral in a fund managed by the\nAdviser that invests in: a broad range of\nmoney market instruments; certificates of\ndeposit and time deposits of U.S. and foreign\nbanks; commercial paper and other high quality\nobligations of U.S. or foreign companies;\nasset-backed securities; mortgage-related\nsecurities; repurchase agreements; and shares\nof money market funds. In the securities\nlending program, the borrower generally has\nthe right to vote the loaned securities;\nhowever, a Fund may call loans to vote proxies\nif a material issue affecting the Fund's\neconomic interest in the investment is to be\nvoted upon.

Securities rated below\ninvestment-grade and unrated securities of\ncomparable credit quality (commonly known as\n\u201chigh-yield bonds\u201d or \u201cjunk bonds\u201d) lack\nstrong investment-grade characteristics, are\nconsidered predominantly speculative with\nrespect to the issuer's continuing ability to\nmake principal and interest payments, and are\nsubject to greater levels of credit, liquidity\nand market risk than higher-rated securities.\nThey can involve a substantially greater risk\nof default than higher-rated securities, and\ntheir values can decline significantly over\nshort periods of time. Issuers of lower-\nquality debt securities may have substantially\ngreater risk of insolvency or bankruptcy than\nissuers of higher-quality debt securities. In\nthe event the issuer of a debt security held\nby a Fund defaults on its payments or becomes\ninsolvent or bankrupt, the Fund may not\nreceive the return it was promised on the\ninvestment and could lose its entire\ninvestment. The lower ratings of junk bonds\nreflect a greater possibility that actual or\nperceived adverse changes in the financial\ncondition of the issuer or in general economic\nconditions, or an unanticipated rise in\ninterest rates, may impair the ability of the\nissuer to make payments of interest and\nprincipal. If this were to occur, the values\nof such securities held by a Fund may fall\nsubstantially and a Fund could lose some or\nall of the value of its investment. Lower-\nquality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or\nthe market or economy in general, than higher\nquality debt securities. The market for lower\nquality debt securities can be less liquid\nthan for higher quality debt securities,\nespecially during periods of recession or\ngeneral market decline, which could make it\ndifficult at times for a Fund to sell certain\nsecurities at prices used in calculating a\nFund's net asset value. These securities may\nhave significant volatility. Call/Prepayment\nRisk . Call/prepayment risk is the risk that\nan issuer will exercise its right to pay\nprincipal on an obligation held by a Fund\nearlier than expected or required. This may\noccur, for example, when there is a decline in\ninterest rates, and an issuer of bonds or\npreferred stock redeems the bonds or stock in\norder to replace them with obligations on\nwhich it is required to pay a lower interest\nor dividend rate. It may also occur when there\nis an unanticipated increase in the rate at\nwhich mortgages or other receivables\nunderlying mortgage- or asset-backed\nsecurities held by a Fund are prepaid. In any\nsuch case, a Fund may be forced to invest the\nprepaid amounts in lower-yielding investments,\nresulting in a decline in the Fund's income.\nCounterparty Risk . A Fund will be subject to\ncredit risk with respect to the counterparties\nwith which the Fund enters into derivatives\ncontracts and other transactions such as\nrepurchase agreements or reverse repurchase\nagreements. A Fund's ability to profit from\nthese types of investments and transactions\nwill depend on the willingness and ability of\nits counterparty to perform its obligations.\nIf a counterparty fails to meet its\ncontractual obligations, a Fund may be unable\nto terminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss\nto the Fund. A Fund may experience significant\ndelays in obtaining any recovery in an\ninsolvency, bankruptcy, or other\nreorganization proceeding involving its\ncounterparty (including recovery of any\ncollateral posted by it) and may obtain only a\nlimited recovery or may obtain no recovery in\nsuch circumstances. If a Fund holds collateral\nposted by its counterparty, it may be delayed\nor prevented from realizing on the collateral\nin the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceeding relating to the counterparty. Under\napplicable law or contractual provisions,\nincluding if a Fund enters into an investment\nor transaction with a financial institution\nand such financial institution (or an\naffiliate of the financial institution)\nexperiences financial difficulties, then the\nFund may in certain situations be prevented or\ndelayed from exercising its rights to\nterminate the investment or transaction, or to\nrealize on any collateral and may result in\nthe suspension of payment and delivery\nobligations of the parties under such\ninvestment or transactions or in another\ninstitution being substituted for that\nfinancial institution without the consent of\nthe Fund. Further, a Fund may be subject to\n\u201cbail-in\u201d risk under applicable law whereby,\nif required by the financial institution's\nauthority, the financial institution's\nliabilities could be written down, eliminated\nor converted into equity or an alternative\ninstrument of ownership. A bail-in of a\nfinancial institution may result in a\nreduction in value of some or all of its\nsecurities and, if a Fund holds such\nsecurities or has entered into a transaction\nwith such a financial security when a bail-in\noccurs, such Fund may also be similarly\nimpacted. Credit Risk . Credit risk is the\nrisk that an issuer, guarantor or liquidity\nprovider of a fixed-income security held by a\nFund may be unable or unwilling, or may be\nperceived (whether by market participants,\nratings agencies, pricing services or\notherwise) as unable or unwilling, to make\ntimely principal and/or interest payments, or\nto otherwise honor its obligations. It\nincludes the risk that the security will be\ndowngraded by a credit rating agency;\ngenerally, lower credit quality issuers\npresent higher credit risks. An actual or\nperceived decline in creditworthiness of an\nissuer of a fixed-income security held by a\nFund may result in a decrease in the value of\nthe security. It is possible that the ability\nof an issuer to meet its obligations will\ndecline substantially during the period when a\nFund owns securities of the issuer or that the\nissuer will default on its obligations or that\nthe obligations of the issuer will be limited\nor restructured. 39 Table of Contents The\ncredit rating assigned to any particular\ninvestment does not necessarily reflect the\nissuer's current financial condition and does\nnot reflect an assessment of an investment's\nvolatility or liquidity. Securities rated in\nthe lowest category of investment-grade are\nconsidered to have speculative\ncharacteristics. If a security held by a Fund\nloses its rating or its rating is downgraded,\nthe Fund may nonetheless continue to hold the\nsecurity in the discretion of the Adviser. In\nthe case of asset-backed or mortgage-related\nsecurities, changes in the actual or perceived\nability of the obligors on the underlying\nassets or mortgages to make payments of\ninterest and/or principal may affect the\nvalues of those securities. Currency Risk.\nInvestments in issuers in different countries\nare often denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar. Changes in the values of\nthose currencies relative to the U.S. dollar\nmay have a positive or negative effect on the\nvalues of a Fund's investments denominated in\nthose currencies. The values of other\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar may\nfluctuate in response to, among other factors,\ninterest rate changes, intervention (or\nfailure to intervene) by national governments,\ncentral banks, or supranational entities such\nas the International Monetary Fund, the\nimposition of currency controls, and other\npolitical or regulatory developments. Currency\nvalues can decrease significantly both in the\nshort term and over the long term in response\nto these and other developments. Continuing\nuncertainty as to the status of the Euro and\nthe Economic and Monetary Union of the\nEuropean Union (the \u201cEMU\u201d) has created\nsignificant volatility in currency and\nfinancial markets generally. Any partial or\ncomplete dissolution of the EMU, or any\ncontinued uncertainty as to its status, could\nhave significant adverse effects on currency\nand financial markets, and on the values of a\nFund's portfolio investments. Debt Securities\nRisk . The values of debt securities may\nincrease or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability\nor unwillingness of issuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments or illiquidity\nin debt securities markets; the risk of low\nrates of return due to reinvestment of\nsecurities during periods of falling interest\nrates or repayment by issuers with higher\ncoupon or interest rates; and/or the risk of\nlow income due to falling interest rates. To\nthe extent that interest rates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally\nanticipated and the value of those securities\nmay fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of a Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, a decline\nin a Fund's income and yield, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of a Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and increased volatility of\nthe fixed income markets. The current\nhistorically low interest rate environment\nheightens the risks associated with rising\ninterest rates. During periods when interest\nrates are at low levels, a Fund's yield can be\nlow, and a Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). If the principal on a debt obligation\nis prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in\nobligations paying interest at lower rates.\nDuring periods of falling interest rates, the\nincome received by a Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater\neffect on the values of debt securities of\nlonger durations. Returns on investments in\ndebt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including\ninvestments in equity securities. Derivatives\nRisk. A derivative is a financial contract the\nvalue of which depends on, or is derived from,\nthe value of an underlying asset, interest\nrate, or index. Derivative transactions\ntypically involve leverage and may have\nsignificant volatility. It is possible that a\nderivative transaction will result in a loss\ngreater than the principal amount invested,\nand a Fund may not be able to close out a\nderivative transaction at a favorable time or\nprice. Risks associated with derivative\ninstruments include potential changes in value\nin response to interest rate changes or other\nmarket developments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential\nfor the derivative transaction not to have the\neffect the Adviser or Sub-Adviser anticipated\nor a different or less favorable effect than\nthe Adviser or Sub-Adviser anticipated; the\nfailure of the counterparty to the derivative\ntransaction to perform its obligations under\nthe transaction or to settle a trade; possible\nmispricing or improper valuation of the\nderivative instrument; imperfect correlation\nin the value of a derivative with the asset,\nrate, or index underlying the derivative; the\nrisk that a Fund may be required to post\ncollateral or margin with its counterparty,\nand will not be able to recover the collateral\nor margin in the event of the counterparty's\ninsolvency or bankruptcy; the risk that a Fund\nwill experience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative instrument, including, without\nlimitation, absence of a secondary trading\nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to a\nFund due to losses on the transaction and an\nincrease in volatility; the potential for the\nderivative transaction to have the effect of\naccelerating the recognition of gain; and\nlegal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction. 40\nTable of Contents Forward Currency Contracts\nRisk . In a forward currency contract, a Fund\nagrees to buy in the future an amount in one\ncurrency in return for another currency, at an\nexchange rate determined at the time the\ncontract is entered into. If currency exchange\nrates have moved against the Fund's position\nat the time the contract is settled or closed,\nthe Fund will lose money on the contract.\nThere is no limit on the extent to which\nexchange rates may move against a Fund's\nposition. The markets for certain currencies\nmay at times become illiquid, and a Fund may\nbe unable to enter into new forward contracts\nor to close out existing contracts. Forward\ncurrency contracts are entered into in the\nover-the-counter market, and a Fund's ability\nto profit from a contract will depend on the\nwillingness and ability of its counterparty to\nperform its obligations under the contract.\nUse by a Fund of foreign currency forward\ncontracts may give rise to investment\nleverage. Futures Contract Risk; Other\nExchange-Traded Derivatives Risk . The risk of\nloss relating to the use of futures contracts\nand other exchange-traded derivatives is\npotentially unlimited. The ability to\nestablish and close out positions in futures\ncontracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives will be subject to the development\nand maintenance of a liquid secondary market.\nThere is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any\nparticular futures contract or other exchange-\ntraded derivative or at any particular time.\nIn the event no such market exists for a\nparticular derivative, it might not be\npossible to effect closing transactions, and\nthe Fund will be unable to terminate the\nderivative. In using futures contracts and\nother exchange-traded derivatives, the Fund\nwill be reliant on the ability of the Adviser\nto predict market and price movements\ncorrectly; the skills needed to use such\nderivatives successfully are different from\nthose needed for traditional portfolio\nmanagement. If the Fund uses futures contracts\nor other exchange-traded derivatives for\nhedging purposes, there is a risk of imperfect\ncorrelation between movements in the prices of\nthe derivatives and movements in the\nsecurities or index underlying the derivatives\nor movements in the prices of the Fund's\ninvestments that are the subject of such\nhedge. The prices of futures and other\nexchange-traded derivatives, for a number of\nreasons, may not correlate perfectly with\nmovements in the securities or index\nunderlying them. For example, participants in\nthe futures markets and in markets for other\nexchange-traded derivatives are subject to\nmargin deposit requirements. Such requirements\nmay cause investors to take actions with\nrespect to their derivatives positions that\nthey would not otherwise take. The margin\nrequirements in the derivatives markets may be\nless onerous than margin requirements in the\nsecurities markets in general, and as a result\nthose markets may attract more speculators\nthan the securities markets do. Increased\nparticipation by speculators in those markets\nmay cause temporary price distortions. Due to\nthe possibility of price distortion, even a\ncorrect forecast of general market trends by\nthe Adviser still may not result in a\nsuccessful derivatives activity over a very\nshort time period. The risk of a position in a\nfutures contract or other exchange-traded\nderivative may be very large compared to the\nrelatively low level of margin the Fund is\nrequired to deposit. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund will incur brokerage fees in\nconnection with its exchange-traded\nderivatives transactions. The Fund will\ntypically be required to post margin with its\nfutures commission merchant in connection with\nits transactions in futures contracts and\nother exchange-traded derivatives. In the\nevent of an insolvency of the futures\ncommission merchant or a clearing house, the\nFund may not be able to recover all (or any)\nof the margin it has posted with the futures\ncommission merchant, or to realize the value\nof any increase in the price of its positions,\nor it may experience a significant delay in\ndoing so. The Fund also may be delayed or\nprevented from recovering margin or other\namounts deposited with a futures commission\nmerchant or futures clearinghouse. The\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (the\n\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various exchanges have\nestablished limits referred to as \u201cspeculative\nposition limits\u201d on the maximum net long or\nnet short positions that any person and\ncertain affiliated entities may hold or\ncontrol in a particular futures contract.\nTrading limits are imposed on the number of\ncontracts that any person may trade on a\nparticular trading day. An exchange may order\nthe liquidation of positions found to be in\nviolation of these limits and it may impose\nsanctions or restrictions. In addition, the\nDodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC to establish\nspeculative position limits on certain\ncommodity futures contracts and their\neconomically equivalent futures, options and\nswaps. Regulatory action taken by the CFTC to\nestablish these additional position limits may\nadversely affect the market liquidity of the\nfutures, options and economically equivalent\nderivatives in which the Fund may invest. It\nis possible that, as a result of such limits,\nthe Fund's Adviser will be precluded from\ntaking positions in certain futures contracts\nor over-the-counter derivatives as a result of\npositions held by other clients of the Adviser\nor Sub-Adviser or by the Adviser or Sub-\nAdviser or its affiliates themselves. 41 Table\nof Contents Futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives traded on markets\noutside the U.S. are not generally subject to\nthe same level of regulation by the CFTC or\nother U.S. regulatory entities as contracts\ntraded in the U.S., including without\nlimitation as to the execution, delivery, and\nclearing of transactions. U.S. regulators\nneither regulate the activities of a foreign\nexchange, nor have the power to compel\nenforcement of the rules of the foreign\nexchange or the laws of the foreign country in\nquestion. Margin and other payments made by a\nFund may not be afforded the same protections\nas are afforded those payments in the U.S.,\nincluding in connection with the insolvency of\nan executing or clearing broker or a\nclearinghouse or exchange. Certain foreign\nfutures contracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives may be less liquid and more\nvolatile than U.S. contracts. Swaps Risk. A\nswap is a two-party contract that generally\nobligates the parties to exchange payments\nbased on a specified reference security,\nbasket of securities, security index or index\ncomponent. Swaps can involve greater risks\nthan direct investment in securities because\nswaps may be leveraged and are subject to\ncounterparty risk (e.g. , the risk of a\ncounterparty's defaulting on the obligation or\nbankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk\n(i.e. , swaps may be difficult to value).\nSwaps may also be considered illiquid. It may\nnot be possible for a Fund to liquidate a swap\nposition at an advantageous time or price,\nwhich may result in significant losses.\nEmerging Markets Risk . Investments in\nemerging markets are generally subject to a\ngreater risk of loss than investments in\ndeveloped markets. This may be due to, among\nother things, the possibility of greater\nmarket volatility, lower trading volume and\nliquidity, greater risk of expropriation,\nnationalization, and social, political and\neconomic instability, greater reliance on a\nfew industries, international trade or revenue\nfrom particular commodities, less developed\naccounting, legal and regulatory systems,\nhigher levels of inflation, deflation or\ncurrency devaluation, greater risk of market\nshut down, and more significant governmental\nlimitations on investment policy as compared\nto those typically found in a developed\nmarket. There may be limited legal rights and\nremedies for investors in companies domiciled\nin emerging markets. In addition, issuers\n(including governments) in emerging market\ncountries may have less financial stability\nthan in other countries. The securities of\nemerging market companies may trade less\nfrequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. Market disruptions or\nsubstantial market corrections may limit very\nsignificantly the liquidity of securities of\ncertain companies in a particular country or\ngeographic region, or of all companies in the\ncountry or region. A Fund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions in such securities at\nany time, or at a favorable price, in order to\nmeet the Fund's obligations. There is also the\npotential for unfavorable action such as\nembargo and acts of war. As a result, there\nwill tend to be an increased risk of price\nvolatility in investments in emerging market\ncountries, which may be magnified by currency\nfluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar.\nSettlement and asset custody practices for\ntransactions in emerging markets may differ\nfrom those in developed markets. Such\ndifferences may include possible delays in\nsettlement and certain settlement practices,\nsuch as delivery of securities prior to\nreceipt of payment, which increase the\nlikelihood of a \u201cfailed settlement.\u201d Failed\nsettlements can result in losses. For these\nand other reasons, investments in emerging\nmarkets are often considered speculative.\nExtension Risk. During periods of rising\ninterest rates, the average life of certain\ntypes of securities may be extended because of\nslower-than-expected principal payments. This\nmay increase the period of time during which\nan investment earns a below-market interest\nrate, increase the security's duration and\nreduce the value of the security. Extension\nrisk may be heightened during periods of\nadverse economic conditions generally, as\npayment rates decline due to higher\nunemployment levels and other factors.\nFinancial Sector Risk. Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which may limit both\nthe amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition.\nIn addition, deterioration of the credit\nmarkets generally may cause an adverse impact\nin a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets.\nCertain events in the financial sector may\ncause an unusually high degree of volatility\nin the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services\ncompanies to incur large losses. Securities of\nfinancial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to\nraise capital (such as the issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or cease operations.\nCredit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses\nassociated with investment activities can 42\nTable of Contents negatively impact the\nsector. Insurance companies may be subject to\nsevere price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could\nadversely affect financial institutions\nengaged in mortgage finance or other lending\nor investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk . The net asset value of\nFund Shares will generally fluctuate with\nchanges in the market value of a Fund's\nsecurities holdings. The market prices of Fund\nShares will generally fluctuate in accordance\nwith changes in a Fund's net asset value and\nsupply and demand of Fund Shares on the\nExchange. It cannot be predicted whether Fund\nShares will trade below, at or above their net\nasset value. Price differences may be due, in\nlarge part, to the fact that supply and demand\nforces at work in the secondary trading market\nfor Fund Shares will be closely related to,\nbut not identical to, the same forces\ninfluencing the prices of the securities of an\nIndex trading individually or in the aggregate\nat any point in time. The market prices of\nFund Shares may deviate significantly from the\nnet asset value of Fund Shares during periods\nof market volatility. However, given that Fund\nShares can be created and redeemed in Creation\nUnits (unlike shares of many closed-end funds,\nwhich frequently trade at appreciable\ndiscounts from, and sometimes at premiums to,\ntheir net asset value), the Adviser (and Sub-\nAdviser, as applicable) believe that large\ndiscounts or premiums to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares should not be sustained over\nlong periods. While the creation/redemption\nfeature is designed to make it likely that\nFund Shares normally will trade close to a\nFund's net asset value, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions or market volatility\nmay result in trading prices that differ\nsignificantly from such Fund's net asset\nvalue. If an investor purchases Fund Shares at\na time when the market price is at a premium\nto the net asset value of Fund Shares or sells\nat a time when the market price is at a\ndiscount to the net asset value of Fund\nShares, then the investor may sustain losses.\nGeographic Focus Risk . The performance of a\nfund that is less diversified across countries\nor geographic regions will be closely tied to\nmarket, currency, economic, political,\nenvironmental, or regulatory conditions and\ndevelopments in the countries or regions in\nwhich the fund invests, and may be more\nvolatile than the performance of a more\ngeographically-diversified fund. Asia .\nCertain Asian economies have experienced high\ninflation, high unemployment, currency\ndevaluations and restrictions, and over-\nextension of credit. Many Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid growth and\nindustrialization, and there is no assurance\nthat this growth rate will be maintained.\nEconomic events in any one Asian country may\nhave a significant economic effect on the\nentire Asian region, as well as on major\ntrading partners outside Asia. Any adverse\nevent in the Asian markets may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on some or all of\nthe economies of the countries in which a Fund\ninvests. Many Asian countries are subject to\npolitical risk, including corruption and\nregional conflict with neighboring countries.\nIn addition, many Asian countries are subject\nto social and labor risks associated with\ndemands for improved political, economic and\nsocial conditions. These risks, among others,\nmay adversely affect the value of a Fund's\ninvestments. Europe . The Economic and\nMonetary Union of the EU requires compliance\nwith restrictions on inflation rates,\ndeficits, interest rates, debt levels and\nfiscal and monetary controls, each of which\nmay significantly affect every country in\nEurope. Decreasing imports or exports, changes\nin governmental or EU regulations on trade,\nchanges in the exchange rate of the euro (the\ncommon currency of certain EU countries), the\ndefault or threat of default by an EU member\ncountry on its sovereign debt, and/or an\neconomic recession in an EU member country may\nhave a significant adverse effect on the\neconomies of EU member countries and their\ntrading partners. The European financial\nmarkets have recently experienced volatility\nand adverse trends due to concerns about\neconomic downturns or rising government debt\nlevels in several European countries,\nincluding Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and\nSpain. These events have adversely affected\nthe exchange rate of the euro and may continue\nto significantly affect every country in\nEurope, including countries that do not use\nthe euro. Responses to the financial problems\nby European governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the desired results,\nmay result in social unrest and may limit\nfuture growth and economic recovery or have\nother unintended consequences. Further\ndefaults or restructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt could have\nadditional adverse effects on economies,\nfinancial markets and asset valuations around\nthe world. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. For example, on January 31, 2020, the\nUnited Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU\n(commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and, after\na transition period, left the EU single market\nand customs union under the terms of a new\ntrade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe 43 Table of Contents United Kingdom and EU\nwith respect to trading goods and services,\nbut critical aspects of the relationship\nremain unresolved and subject to further\nnegotiation and agreement. The full scope and\nnature of the consequences of the exit are not\nat this time known and are unlikely to be\nknown for a significant period of time. It is\nalso unknown whether the United Kingdom's exit\nwill increase the likelihood of other\ncountries also departing the EU. Any exits\nfrom the EU, or the possibility of such exits,\nmay have a significant impact on the United\nKingdom, Europe, and global economies, which\nmay result in increased volatility and\nilliquidity, new legal and regulatory\nuncertainties and potentially lower economic\ngrowth for such economies that could\npotentially have an adverse effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. In addition,\na number of countries in Europe have suffered\nterrorist attacks and additional attacks may\noccur in the future. Such attacks may cause\nuncertainty in financial markets and may\nadversely affect the performance of the\nissuers to which the Fund has exposure. Japan.\nThe growth of Japan's economy has historically\nlagged that of its Asian neighbors and other\nmajor developed economies. The Japanese\neconomy is heavily dependent on international\ntrade and has been adversely affected by trade\ntariffs, other protectionist measures,\ncompetition from emerging economies and the\neconomic conditions of its trading partners.\nChina has become an important trading partner\nwith Japan, yet the countries' political\nrelationship has become strained. Should\npolitical tension increase, it could adversely\naffect the economy, especially the export\nsector, and destabilize the region as a whole.\nJapan also remains heavily dependent on oil\nimports, and higher commodity prices could\ntherefore have a negative impact on the\neconomy. The Japanese economy faces several\nother concerns, including a financial system\nwith large levels of nonperforming loans,\nover-leveraged corporate balance sheets,\nextensive cross-ownership by major\ncorporations, a changing corporate governance\nstructure, and large government deficits.\nThese issues may cause a slowdown of the\nJapanese economy. The Japanese yen has\nfluctuated widely at times and any increase in\nits value may cause a decline in exports that\ncould weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has,\nin the past, intervened in the currency\nmarkets to attempt to maintain or reduce the\nvalue of the yen. Japanese intervention in the\ncurrency markets could cause the value of the\nyen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and\ncould cause losses to investors. Japan has an\naging workforce and has experienced a\nsignificant population decline in recent\nyears. Japan's labor market appears to be\nundergoing fundamental structural changes, as\na labor market traditionally accustomed to\nlifetime employment adjusts to meet the need\nfor increased labor mobility, which may\nadversely affect Japan's economic\ncompetitiveness. The nuclear power plant\ncatastrophe in Japan in March 2011 may have\nlong-term effects on the Japanese economy and\nits nuclear energy industry. Natural\ndisasters, such as earthquakes, volcanoes,\ntyphoons or tsunamis, could occur in Japan or\nsurrounding areas and could negatively affect\nthe Japanese economy and, in turn, a Fund.\nUnited Kingdom. The United Kingdom has one of\nthe largest economies in Europe, and the\nUnited States and other European countries are\nsubstantial trading partners of the United\nKingdom. As a result, the British economy may\nbe impacted by changes to the economic\ncondition of the United States and other\nEuropean countries. The British economy, along\nwith certain other EU economies, experienced a\nsignificant economic slowdown during the\nrecent financial crisis, and certain British\nfinancial institutions suffered significant\nlosses, were severely under-capitalized and\nrequired government intervention to survive.\nThe British economy relies heavily on the\nexport of financial services to the United\nStates and other European countries and,\ntherefore, a prolonged slowdown in the\nfinancial services sector may have a negative\nimpact on the British economy. Continued\ngovernmental involvement or control in certain\nsectors may stifle competition in certain\nsectors or cause adverse effects on economic\ngrowth. In the past, the United Kingdom has\nbeen a target of terrorism. Acts of terrorism\nin the United Kingdom or against British\ninterests abroad may cause uncertainty in the\nBritish financial markets and adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which a Fund\nhas exposure. On January 31, 2020, the United\nKingdom formally withdrew from the EU\n(commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and, after\na transition period, left the EU single market\nand customs union under the terms of a new\ntrade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to\ntrading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain unresolved\nand subject to further negotiation and\nagreement. There is still considerable\nuncertainty relating to the potential\nconsequences associated with the exit and\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Brexit may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, 44 Table of\nContents which may result in increased\nvolatility and illiquidity, new legal and\nregulatory uncertainties and potentially lower\neconomic growth for these economies that could\npotentially have an adverse effect on the\nvalue of a Fund's investments. Income Risk. A\nFund's income may decline due to falling\ninterest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by a Fund may call or redeem\nthe securities during periods of falling\ninterest rates, and the Fund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in securities paying\nlower interest rates. If an obligation held by\na Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment in other obligations\npaying income at lower rates. A reduction in\nthe income earned by a Fund may limit the\nFund's ability to achieve its objective.\nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk . Each\nFund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance\nof an unmanaged index of securities. Each Fund\nwill seek to provide investment results that\ncorrespond generally to the performance of the\nIndex, regardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. Each\nFund generally will buy and will not sell a\nsecurity included in the Index as long as the\nsecurity is part of the Index regardless of\nany sudden or material decline in value or\nforeseeable material decline in value of the\nsecurity, even though the Adviser may make a\ndifferent investment decision for other\nactively managed accounts or portfolios that\nhold the security. As a result, a Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of\na portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Index (in absolute terms and\nby comparison with other indices) and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of a Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index\nin accordance with its methodology may occur\nfrom time to time and may not be identified\nand corrected by the Index Provider for a\nperiod of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on a Fund and its shareholders.\nWhile the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index (i.e., achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with the Index), a\nFund's return may not match the return of the\nIndex for a number of reasons. For example,\nthe return on the sample of securities\npurchased by a Fund (or the return on\nsecurities not included in the Index) may not\ncorrelate precisely with the return of the\nIndex. Each Fund incurs a number of operating\nexpenses not applicable to the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying and selling securities.\nIn addition, a Fund may not be fully invested\nat times, either as a result of cash flows\ninto or out of the Fund or reserves of cash\nheld by the Fund to meet redemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to track the Index return\nby investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between a\nFund's return and that of the Index. Changes\nin the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact a Fund's ability\nto match the return of the Index. The Adviser\nmay apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or investment\ntechniques to refine or limit the number or\ntypes of issuers included in the Index in\nwhich a Fund may invest. Application of such\nscreens or techniques may result in investment\nperformance below that of the Index and may\nnot produce results expected by the Adviser.\nIndex tracking risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. Pursuant to each\nIndex methodology, a security may be removed\nfrom an Index in the event that it does not\ncomply with the eligibility requirements of\nthe Index. As a result, a Fund may be forced\nto sell securities at inopportune times and/or\nunfavorable prices due to these changes in the\nIndex components. When there are changes made\nto the component securities of an Index and\nthe corresponding Fund in turn makes similar\nchanges to its portfolio to attempt to\nincrease the correlation between the Fund's\nportfolio and the Index, any transaction costs\nand market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled\nchanges to an Index may expose the\ncorresponding Fund to additional tracking\nerror risk. A Fund may recognize gains as a\nresult of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the corresponding\nIndex. A Fund also may be required to\ndistribute any such gains to its shareholders\nto avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. Industrial Sector Risk .\nIndustrial companies are affected by supply\nand demand both for their specific product or\nservice and for industrial sector products in\ngeneral. Government regulation, world events,\nexchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil\nliabilities will likewise affect the\nperformance of these companies. Aerospace and\ndefense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry\nrely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products\nand services. Thus, the financial condition\nof, and investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by 45\nTable of Contents governmental defense\nspending policies which are typically under\npressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and\nother) government budgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component of the industrial\nsector, are cyclical and have occasional sharp\nprice movements which may result from changes\nin the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements\nand insurance costs. Inflation-Indexed\nSecurities Risk . The principal amount of an\ninflation-indexed security typically increases\nwith inflation and decreases with deflation,\nas measured by a specified index. It is\npossible that, in a period of declining\ninflation rates, a Fund could receive at\nmaturity less than the initial principal\namount of an inflation-indexed security.\nAlthough the holders of U.S. TIPS receive no\nless than the par value of the security at\nmaturity, if a Fund purchases U.S. TIPS in the\nsecondary market whose principal values have\npreviously been adjusted upward and there is a\nperiod of subsequent declining inflation\nrates, a Fund may receive at maturity less\nthan it invested. Depending on the changes in\ninflation rates during the period a Fund holds\nan inflation-indexed security, a Fund may earn\nless on the security than on a conventional\nbond. The principal amounts of inflation-\nindexed securities are typically only adjusted\nperiodically, and changes in the values of the\nsecurities may only approximately reflect\nchanges in inflation rates and may occur\nsubstantially after the changes in inflation\nrates in question occur. Interest Rate Risk .\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the\nsecurities held by a Fund will decline in\nvalue because of increases in market interest\nrates. Duration is a measure used to determine\nthe sensitivity of a security's price to\nchanges in interest rates. Debt securities\nwith longer durations tend to be more\nsensitive to changes in interest rates,\nusually making them more volatile than debt\nsecurities with shorter durations. For\nexample, the value of a security with a\nduration of five years would be expected to\ndecrease by 5% for every 1% increase in\ninterest rates. Falling interest rates also\ncreate the potential for a decline in a Fund's\nincome and yield. Interest-only and principal-\nonly securities are especially sensitive to\ninterest rate changes, which can affect not\nonly their prices but can also change the\nincome flows and repayment assumptions about\nthose investments. Variable and floating rate\nsecurities also generally increase or decrease\nin value in response to changes in interest\nrates, although generally to a lesser degree\nthan fixed-rate securities. A substantial\nincrease in interest rates may also have an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of a security,\nespecially those with longer durations.\nInterest rate changes can be sudden and\nunpredictable, and are influenced by a number\nof factors, including government policy,\nmonetary policy, inflation expectations,\nperceptions of risk, and supply and demand for\nbonds. Changes in government or central bank\npolicy, including changes in tax policy or\nchanges in a central bank's implementation of\nspecific policy goals, may have a substantial\nimpact on interest rates. This could lead to\nheightened levels of interest rate, volatility\nand liquidity risks for the fixed income\nmarkets generally and could have a substantial\nand immediate effect on the values of a Fund's\ninvestments. There can be no guarantee that\nany particular government or central bank\npolicy will be continued, discontinued or\nchanged, nor that any such policy will have\nthe desired effect on interest rates.\nLeveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions,\nreverse repurchase agreements, certain\nderivatives transactions, securities lending\ntransactions and other investment transactions\nsuch as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or\nforward commitment transactions may create\ninvestment leverage. If a Fund engages in\ntransactions that have a leveraging effect on\nthe Fund's investment portfolio, the value of\nthe Fund will be potentially more volatile and\nall other risks will tend to be compounded.\nThis is because leverage generally creates\ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than a Fund would otherwise have and\nso magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to\nbe a speculative investment practice and may\nresult in losses to a Fund. Certain\nderivatives have the potential for unlimited\nloss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause a\nFund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,\ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to\nmeet asset segregation or coverage\nrequirements. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk\nis the risk that a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of investments readily at a favorable\ntime or prices (or at all) or at prices\napproximating those at which a Fund currently\nvalues them. For example, certain investments\nmay be subject to restrictions on resale, may\ntrade in the over-the-counter market or in\nlimited volume, or may not have an active\ntrading market. Illiquid investments may trade\nat a discount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. It may be\ndifficult for a Fund to value illiquid\ninvestments accurately. The market for certain\ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular issuer. If the liquidity of a\nFund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead to\ndifferences between the market price of Fund\nShares and the net asset value of Fund Shares,\nand could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Disposal of illiquid investments may\nentail 46 Table of Contents registration\nexpenses and other transaction costs that are\nhigher than those for liquid investments. A\nFund may seek to borrow money to meet its\nobligations (including among other things\nredemption obligations) if it is unable to\ndispose of illiquid investments, resulting in\nborrowing expenses and possible leveraging of\nthe Fund. Market Risk . Market prices of\ninvestments held by a Fund will go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. A Fund's\ninvestments are subject to changes in general\neconomic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in\ninvestment in securities markets. Investment\nmarkets can be volatile, and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors, including, but not limited\nto, economic growth or recession, changes in\ninterest rates, changes in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in a\nFund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the\nFund invests do not perform well or are\nadversely affected by events. Further, legal,\npolitical, regulatory and tax changes also may\ncause fluctuations in markets and securities\nprices. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments. An outbreak of a respiratory\ndisease caused by a novel coronavirus (known\nas COVID-19) first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has resulted in a global\npandemic and major disruptions to economies\nand markets around the world, including the\nUnited States. Although the long-term economic\nfallout of COVID-19 is difficult to predict,\nit has contributed to, and may continue to\ncontribute to, market volatility, inflation\nand systemic economic weakness, and trading in\nmany instruments was and may continue to be\ndisrupted as a result. Liquidity for many\ninstruments was and may continue to be greatly\nreduced for periods of time. Some interest\nrates have been very low and in some cases\nyields are negative. Governments and central\nbanks, including the Federal Reserve in the\nUnited States, have taken extraordinary and\nunprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal economies and the financial markets.\nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective to mitigate the economic and\nmarket disruption, will not be known for some\ntime. The foregoing could result in\ndisruptions to the services provided to a Fund\nby its service providers. Non-Diversification\nRisk . Funds classified as \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nmay hold a smaller number of portfolio\nsecurities than many other funds. To the\nextent a Fund invests in a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a decline in the market\nvalue of a particular security held by the\nFund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than\nthe values of shares of more diversified\nfunds. A non-diversified Fund may become\ndiversified for periods of time solely as a\nresult of tracking its Index (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Non-U.S. Securities Risk .\nInvestments in securities of non-U.S. issuers\nentail risks not typically associated with\ninvesting in securities of U.S. issuers.\nSimilar risks may apply to securities traded\non a U.S. securities exchange that are issued\nby entities with significant exposure to\nnon-U.S. countries. In certain countries,\nlegal remedies available to investors may be\nmore limited than those available with regard\nto U.S. investments. Because non-U.S.\nsecurities are typically denominated and\ntraded in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar, the value of the Fund's assets, to the\nextent they are non-U.S. dollar denominated,\nmay be affected favorably or unfavorably by\ncurrency exchange rates, exchange control\nregulations, and delays, restrictions or\nprohibitions on the repatriation of non-U.S.\ncurrencies. To the extent underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are closed when the exchange on\nwhich the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of\nan underlying security and the last quoted\nprice for the underlying security on the\nclosed foreign market. These deviations could\nresult in the Fund experiencing premiums or\ndiscounts greater than those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic securities. Income and\ngains with respect to investments in certain\ncountries may be subject to withholding and\nother taxes. There may be less information\npublicly available about a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S. entity, and many non-U.S.\nentities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, and financial reporting standards,\nregulatory framework and practices comparable\nto those in the United States. The securities\nof some non-U.S. entities are less liquid and\nat times more volatile than securities of\ncomparable U.S. entities, and could become\nsubject to sanctions or embargoes that\nadversely affect a Fund's investment. Non-U.S.\ntransaction costs, such as brokerage\ncommissions and custody costs may be higher\nthan in the U.S. In addition, there may be a\npossibility of nationalization or\nexpropriation of assets, imposition of\ncurrency exchange controls, confiscatory\ntaxation, and diplomatic developments that\ncould adversely affect the values of a Fund's\ninvestments in certain non-U.S. countries.\nInvestments in securities of non-U.S. issuers\nalso are subject to foreign political and\neconomic risk not associated with U.S.\ninvestments, meaning that political events\n(civil unrest, national elections, changes in\npolitical conditions and foreign relations,\nimposition of exchange controls and 47 Table\nof Contents repatriation restrictions), social\nand economic events (labor strikes, rising\ninflation) and natural disasters occurring in\na country where a Fund invests could cause the\nFund's investments in that country to\nexperience gains or losses. Certain countries\nhave recently experienced (or currently are\nexpected to experience) negative interest\nrates on certain fixed-income securities, and\nsimilar interest rate conditions may be\nexperienced in other regions. Investments in\nfixed-income securities with very low or\nnegative interest rates may magnify a Fund's\nsusceptibility to interest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and performance, and such\ninvestments may be subject to heightened\nvolatility and reduced liquidity. Reinvestment\nRisk. Income from a Fund's portfolio may\ndecline when the Fund invests the proceeds\nfrom investment income, sales of portfolio\nsecurities or matured, traded or called debt\nobligations. For instance, during periods of\ndeclining interest rates, an issuer of debt\nobligations may exercise an option to redeem\nsecurities prior to maturity, forcing a Fund\nto reinvest the proceeds in lower-yielding\nsecurities. A decline in income received by a\nFund from its investments is likely to have a\nnegative effect on the yield and total return\nof the Fund Shares. Restricted Securities Risk\n. A Fund may hold securities that have not\nbeen registered for sale to the public under\nthe U.S. federal securities laws pursuant to\nan exemption from registration. These\nsecurities may be less liquid than securities\nregistered for sale to the general public. The\nliquidity of a restricted security may be\naffected by a number of factors, including,\namong others: (i) the creditworthiness of the\nissuer; (ii) the frequency of trades and\nquotes for the security; (iii) the number of\ndealers willing to purchase or sell the\nsecurity and the number of other potential\npurchasers; (iv) dealer undertakings to make a\nmarket in the security; (v) the nature of any\nlegal restrictions governing trading in the\nsecurity; and (vi) the nature of the security\nand the nature of marketplace trades. There\ncan be no assurance that a liquid trading\nmarket will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Also,\nrestricted securities may be difficult to\nvalue because market quotations may not be\nreadily available, and the securities may have\nsignificant volatility. Settlement Risk .\nMarkets in different countries have different\nclearance and settlement procedures and in\ncertain markets there have been times when\nsettlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of transactions. Delays in\nsettlement may increase credit risk to a Fund,\nlimit the ability of a Fund to reinvest the\nproceeds of a sale of securities, hinder the\nability of a Fund to lend its portfolio\nsecurities, and potentially subject a Fund to\npenalties for its failure to deliver to on-\npurchasers of securities whose delivery to a\nFund was delayed. Delays in the settlement of\nsecurities purchased by a Fund may limit the\nability of a Fund to sell those securities at\ntimes and prices it considers desirable, and\nmay subject a Fund to losses and costs due to\nits own inability to settle with subsequent\npurchasers of the securities from it. A Fund\nmay be required to borrow monies it had\notherwise expected to receive in connection\nwith the settlement of securities sold by it,\nin order to meet its obligations to others.\nLimits on the ability of a Fund to purchase or\nsell securities due to settlement delays could\nincrease any variance between a Fund's\nperformance and that of its benchmark index.\nSovereign Debt Obligations Risk . Investments\nin debt securities issued by governments or by\ngovernment agencies and instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that the governmental\nentities responsible for repayment may be\nunable or unwilling to pay interest and repay\nprincipal when due. A governmental entity's\nwillingness or ability to pay interest and\nrepay principal in a timely manner may be\naffected by a variety of factors, including\nits cash flow, the size of its reserves, its\naccess to foreign exchange, the relative size\nof its debt service burden to its economy as a\nwhole, and political constraints. A\ngovernmental entity may default on its\nobligations or may require renegotiation or\nreschedule of debt payments. Any restructuring\nof a sovereign debt obligation held by a Fund\nwill likely have a significant adverse effect\non the value of the obligation. In the event\nof default of sovereign debt, the Fund may be\nunable to pursue legal action against the\nsovereign issuer or to realize on collateral\nsecuring the debt. The sovereign debt of many\nnon-U.S. governments, including their sub-\ndivisions and instrumentalities, is rated\nbelow investment-grade. Sovereign debt risk\nmay be greater for debt securities issued or\nguaranteed by emerging and/or frontier\ncountries. Unconstrained Sector Risk . A Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets\nwithin one or more economic sectors or\nindustries, which may change from time to\ntime. When a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector,\nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\n48 Table of Contents Valuation Risk . Some\nportfolio holdings, potentially a large\nportion of a Fund's investment portfolio, may\nbe valued on the basis of factors other than\nmarket quotations. This may occur more often\nin times of market turmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are multiple methods that can\nbe used to value a portfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from\nwhat would be produced using a different\nmethodology or if it had been priced using\nmarket quotations. Portfolio holdings that are\nvalued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. Technological issues or other service\ndisruption issues involving third-party\nservice providers may cause a Fund to value\nits investments incorrectly. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that a Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the\nvalue established for it at any time, and it\nis possible that a Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established\nby a Fund at that time. Non-Principal Risks\nEach risk discussed below is a non-principal\nrisk of a Fund to the extent it is not\nidentified as a principal risk for such Fund\nin the preceding \u201cADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION\n- PRINCIPAL RISKS\u201d section. Authorized\nParticipants, Market Makers and Liquidity\nProviders Concentration Risk. A Fund has a\nlimited number of financial institutions that\nmay act as Authorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d),\nwhich are responsible for the creation and\nredemption activity for a Fund. In addition,\nthere may be a limited number of market makers\nand/or liquidity providers in the marketplace.\nTo the extent either of the following events\noccur, Fund Shares may trade at a material\ndiscount to NAV and possibly face delisting:\n(i) APs exit the business or otherwise become\nunable to process creation and/or redemption\norders and no other APs step forward to\nperform these services, or (ii) market makers\nand/or liquidity providers exit the business\nor significantly reduce their business\nactivities and no other entities step forward\nto perform their functions. Cash Transaction\nRisk . To the extent a Fund sells portfolio\nsecurities to meet some or all of a redemption\nrequest with cash, the Fund may incur taxable\ngains or losses that it might not have\nincurred had it made redemptions entirely in-\nkind. As a result, a Fund may pay out higher\nannual capital gain distributions than if the\nin-kind redemption process was used.\nConcentration Risk. A Fund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries, but only to the extent that the\nFund's underlying Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries.\nWhen a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector,\nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nConflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a\nFund will be subject to a number of actual or\npotential conflicts of interest. For example,\nthe Adviser or its affiliates may provide\nservices to a Fund, such as securities lending\nagency services, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer\nagency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for\nwhich the Fund would compensate the Adviser\nand/or such affiliates. The Funds may invest\nin other pooled investment vehicles sponsored,\nmanaged, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the\nAdviser or its affiliates, or the terms on\nwhich it enters into transactions with the\nAdviser or its affiliates will be the most\nfavorable available in the market generally or\nas favorable as the rates the Adviser or its\naffiliates make available to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of a\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements. The Adviser and its\naffiliates serve as investment adviser to\nother clients and may make investment\ndecisions that may be different from those\nthat will be made by the Adviser on behalf of\nthe Funds. For example, the Adviser may\nprovide asset allocation advice to some\nclients that may include a recommendation to\ninvest in or redeem from particular issuers\nwhile not providing that same recommendation\nto all clients invested in the same or similar\nissuers. The Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to\npurchase (or sell) investments for a Fund and\nto sell (or purchase) the same investment for\naccounts, funds, or structured products for\nwhich it serves as asset manager, or for other\nclients or affiliates. The Adviser and its\naffiliates may invest for clients in various\nsecurities that are senior, pari passuor\njunior to, or have interests different from or\nadverse to, the securities that are owned by a\n49 Table of Contents Fund. The Adviser or its\naffiliates, in connection with its other\nbusiness activities, may acquire material\nnonpublic confidential information that may\nrestrict the Adviser from purchasing\nsecurities or selling securities for itself or\nits clients (including the Funds) or otherwise\nusing such information for the benefit of its\nclients or itself. The foregoing does not\npurport to be a comprehensive list or complete\nexplanation of all potential conflicts of\ninterests which may affect a Fund. A Fund may\nencounter circumstances, or enter into\ntransactions, in which conflicts of interest\nthat are not listed or discussed above may\narise. Costs of Buying and Selling Shares .\nInvestors buying or selling Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market will pay brokerage\ncommissions or other charges imposed by\nbrokers, as determined by that broker.\nBrokerage commissions are often a fixed amount\nand may be a significant proportional cost for\ninvestors seeking to buy or sell relatively\nsmall amounts of Fund Shares. In addition,\nsecondary market investors will also incur the\ncost of the difference between the price that\nan investor is willing to pay for Fund Shares\n(the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at which an\ninvestor is willing to sell Fund Shares (the\n\u201cask\u201d price). This difference in bid and ask\nprices is often referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or\n\u201cbid/ask spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies\nover time for Fund Shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and is generally\nlower if Fund Shares have more trading volume\nand market liquidity and higher if Fund Shares\nhave little trading volume and market\nliquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask\nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,\nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may\nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making\nsmall investments. Cybersecurity Risk . With\nthe increased use of technologies such as the\nInternet and the dependence on computer\nsystems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, funds (such as the Funds) and their\nservice providers (including the Adviser) may\nbe prone to operational and information\nsecurity risks resulting from cyber-attacks\nand/or technological malfunctions. In general,\ncyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects.\nCyber-attacks include, among others, stealing\nor corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate users from\naccessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information\nwithout authorization, and causing operational\ndisruption. Successful cyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns of, a Fund, the\nAdviser, a sub-adviser or a custodian,\ntransfer agent, or other affiliated or third-\nparty service provider may adversely affect a\nFund or its shareholders. For instance, cyber-\nattacks or technical malfunctions may\ninterfere with the processing of shareholder\nor other transactions, affect a Fund's ability\nto calculate its NAV, cause the release of\nprivate shareholder information or\nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject a Fund\nto regulatory fines, penalties or financial\nlosses, reimbursement or other compensation\ncosts, and additional compliance costs. Cyber-\nattacks or technical malfunctions may render\nrecords of Fund assets and transactions,\nshareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and\nother data integral to the functioning of a\nFund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete.\nA Fund may also incur substantial costs for\ncybersecurity risk management in order to\nprevent cyber incidents in the future. A Fund\nand its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. While the Adviser and/or\nthe Sub-Adviser have established business\ncontinuity plans and systems designed to\nminimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the\nuse of technology, processes and controls,\nthere are inherent limitations in such plans\nand systems, including the possibility that\ncertain risks have not been identified, given\nthe evolving nature of this threat. Each Fund\nrelies on third-party service providers for\nmany of its day-to-day operations, and will be\nsubject to the risk that the protections and\nprotocols implemented by those service\nproviders will be ineffective to protect the\nFund from cyber-attack. The Adviser does not\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems\nput in place by third-party service providers,\nand such third-party service providers may\nhave limited indemnification obligations to\nthe Adviser or the Funds. Similar types of\ncybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions\nalso are present for issuers of securities in\nwhich each Fund invests, which could result in\nmaterial adverse consequences for such\nissuers, and may cause a Fund's investment in\nsuch securities to lose value. Index\nConstruction Risk . A security included in an\nIndex may not exhibit the characteristic or\nprovide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently a Fund's holdings\nmay not exhibit returns consistent with that\ncharacteristic or exposure. 50 Table of\nContents Index Licensing Risk . It is possible\nthat the license under which the Adviser or a\nFund is permitted to replicate or otherwise\nuse an Index will be terminated or may be\ndisputed, impaired or cease to remain in\neffect. In such a case, the Adviser may be\nrequired to replace the relevant Index with\nanother index which it considers to be\nappropriate in light of the investment\nstrategy of a Fund. The use of any such\nsubstitute index may have an adverse impact on\na Fund's performance. In the event that the\nAdviser is unable to identify a suitable\nreplacement for the relevant Index, it may\ndetermine to terminate a Fund. Money Market\nRisk . An investment in a money market fund is\nnot a deposit of any bank and is not insured\nor guaranteed by the FDIC or any other\ngovernment agency. Certain money market funds\nseek to preserve the value of their shares at\n$1.00 per share, although there can be no\nassurance that they will do so, and it is\npossible to lose money by investing in such a\nmoney market fund. A major or unexpected\nchange in interest rates or a decline in the\ncredit quality of an issuer or entity\nproviding credit support, an inactive trading\nmarket for money market instruments, or\nadverse market, economic, industry, political,\nregulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions\ncould cause the share price of such a money\nmarket fund to fall below $1.00. It is\npossible that such a money market fund will\nissue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at\ntimes when the fair value of the money market\nfund's portfolio per share is more or less\nthan $1.00. None of State Street Corporation,\nState Street, State Street Global Advisors\n(\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates (the\n\u201cState Street Entities\u201d) guarantee the value\nof an investment in a money market fund at\n$1.00 per share. Investors should have no\nexpectation of capital support to a money\nmarket fund from State Street Entities. Other\nmoney market funds price and transact at a\n\u201cfloating\u201d NAV that will fluctuate along with\nchanges in the market-based value of fund\nassets. Shares sold utilizing a floating NAV\nmay be worth more or less than their original\npurchase price. Recent changes in the\nregulation of money market funds may affect\nthe operations and structures of money market\nfunds. A money market fund may be permitted or\nrequired to impose redemption fees or to\nimpose limitations on redemptions during\nperiods of high illiquidity in the markets for\nthe investments held by it. Portfolio Turnover\nRisk . A Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to a Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of securities\nand reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover\nhave the effect of reducing a Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities\nby the Fund may result in the realization of\ntaxable capital gains, including short-term\ncapital gains. A Fund may engage in\nsignificant trading of its portfolio\nsecurities in connection with Index\nrebalancing. Frequent or significant trading\nmay cause a Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does\nnot engage in frequent or significant trading.\nSecurities Lending Risk. Each Fund may lend\nportfolio securities in an amount not to\nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For\nthese purposes, net assets shall exclude the\nvalue of all assets received as collateral for\nthe loan. Such loans may be terminated at any\ntime. Any such loans must be continuously\nsecured by collateral maintained on a current\nbasis in an amount at least equal to the\nmarket value of the securities loaned by a\nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a\nloan transaction, as compensation for lending\nits securities, a Fund will receive a portion\nof the dividends or interest accrued on the\nsecurities held as collateral or, in the case\nof cash collateral, a portion of the income\nfrom the investment of such cash. In addition,\na Fund will receive the amount of all\ndividends, interest and other distributions on\nthe loaned securities. However, the borrower\nhas the right to vote the loaned securities. A\nFund will call loans to vote proxies if a\nmaterial issue affecting the investment is to\nbe voted upon. Efforts to recall such\nsecurities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly\ntraded securities, and may involve expenses to\na Fund. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. Should the borrower of the securities\nfail financially, a Fund may experience delays\nin recovering the securities or exercising its\nrights in the collateral. Loans are made only\nto borrowers that are deemed by the securities\nlending agent to be of good financial\nstanding. In a loan transaction, a Fund will\nalso bear the risk of any decline in value of\nsecurities provided as collateral or acquired\nwith cash collateral. Each Fund will attempt\nto minimize this risk by limiting the\ninvestment of cash collateral to high quality\ninstruments of short maturity either directly\non behalf of the lending Fund or through one\nor more joint accounts or funds, which may\ninclude those managed by the Adviser. To the\nextent the collateral provided or investments\nmade with cash collateral differ from\nsecurities included in an Index, such\ncollateral or investments may have a greater\nrisk of 51 Table of Contents loss than the\nsecurities included in the Index. In addition,\na Fund will be subject to the risk that any\nincome generated by lending its securities or\nreinvesting cash collateral is lower than any\nfees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower.\nThe Adviser will take into account the tax\nimpact to shareholders of substitute payments\nfor dividends when overseeing a Fund's\nsecurities lending activity. Trading Issues .\nAlthough Fund Shares are listed for trading on\nthe Exchange and may be listed or traded on\nU.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than\nthe Exchange, there can be no assurance that\nan active trading market for such Fund Shares\nwill develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund\nShares on the Exchange may be halted due to\nmarket conditions or for reasons that, in the\nview of the Exchange, make trading in Fund\nShares inadvisable. In addition, trading in\nFund Shares on the Exchange is subject to\ntrading halts caused by extraordinary market\nvolatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit\nbreaker\u201d rules. Similar to the shares of\noperating companies listed on a stock\nexchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and\nare therefore subject to the risk of increased\nvolatility in the trading price of the Fund's\nshares. While each Fund expects that the\nability of Authorized Participants to create\nand redeem Fund Shares at net asset value\nshould be effective in reducing any such\nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such\nshort sales. There can be no assurance that\nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of a Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that\nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at\nall, on any stock exchange. 52\n\nTable of Contents\n\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves\nas the investment adviser to each Fund and,\nsubject to the oversight of the Board, is\nresponsible for the investment management of\neach Fund. The Adviser provides an investment\nmanagement program for each Fund and manages\nthe investment of each Fund's assets. In\naddition, the Adviser provides administrative,\ncompliance and general management services to\neach Fund. The Adviser is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Global Advisors,\nInc., which itself is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Corporation. The\nAdviser is registered with the SEC under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nThe Adviser and certain other affiliates of\nState Street Corporation make up SSGA. SSGA is\none of the world's largest institutional money\nmanagers and the investment management arm of\nState Street Corporation.

The\nteam approach is used to create an environment\nthat encourages the flow of investment ideas.\nThe portfolio managers within each team work\ntogether in a cohesive manner to develop and\nenhance techniques that drive the investment\nprocess for the respective investment\nstrategy. This approach requires portfolio\nmanagers to share a variety of\nresponsibilities, including investment\nstrategy and analysis, while retaining\nresponsibility for the implementation of the\nstrategy within any particular portfolio.

The trading prices of Fund Shares\nwill fluctuate continuously throughout trading\nhours based on market supply and demand rather\nthan the relevant Fund's net asset value,\nwhich is calculated for each Fund once daily\nas of the close of the regular trading session\non the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern\ntime) on each day that such exchange is open.\nFund Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nprices that may be above ( i.e., at a premium)\nor below ( i.e., at a discount), to varying\ndegrees, the calculated net asset value of\nFund Shares. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nmay deviate significantly from the relevant\nFund's net asset value during periods of\nmarket volatility. Given, however, that Fund\nShares can be issued and redeemed daily in\nCreation Units, the Adviser believes that\nlarge discounts and premiums to net asset\nvalue should not be sustained over long\nperiods. The Exchange will disseminate, every\nfifteen seconds during the regular trading\nday, an indicative optimized portfolio value\n(\u201cIOPV\u201d) relating to each Fund. The IOPV\ncalculations are estimates of the value of\neach Fund's net asset value per Fund Share.\nPremiums and discounts between the IOPV and\nthe market price may occur. This should not be\nviewed as a \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net\nasset value per Fund Share. The IOPV is based\non the current market value 58 Table of\nContents of the published basket of portfolio\nsecurities and/or cash required to be\ndeposited in exchange for a Creation Unit and\ndoes not necessarily reflect the precise\ncomposition of a Fund's actual portfolio at a\nparticular point in time. Moreover, the IOPV\nis generally determined by using current\nmarket quotations and/or price quotations\nobtained from broker-dealers and other market\nintermediaries and valuations based on current\nmarket rates. The IOPV may not be calculated\nin the same manner as the NAV, which (i) is\ncomputed only once a day, (ii) unlike the\ncalculation of the IOPV, takes into account\nFund expenses, and (iii) may be subject, in\naccordance with the requirements of the 1940\nAct, to fair valuation at different prices\nthan those used in the calculations of the\nIOPV. The IOPV price is based on quotes and\nclosing prices from the securities' local\nmarket converted into U.S. dollars at the\ncurrent currency rates and may not reflect\nevents that occur subsequent to the local\nmarket's close. Therefore, the IOPV may not\nreflect the best possible valuation of a\nFund's current portfolio. Neither the Funds\nnor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are\ninvolved in, or responsible for, the\ncalculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and\nmake no warranty as to their accuracy. The\nFunds do not impose any restrictions on the\nfrequency of purchases and redemptions;\nhowever, the Funds reserve the right to reject\nor limit purchases at any time as described in\nthe SAI. When considering that no restriction\nor policy was necessary, the Board evaluated\nthe risks posed by market timing activities,\nsuch as whether frequent purchases and\nredemptions would interfere with the efficient\nimplementation of a Fund's investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause a Fund\nto experience increased transaction costs. The\nBoard considered that, unlike traditional\nmutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and\nredeemed only in large quantities of shares\nknown as Creation Units, available only from a\nFund directly, and that most trading in a Fund\noccurs on the Exchange at prevailing market\nprices and does not involve the Fund directly.\nGiven this structure, the Board determined\nthat it is unlikely that (a) market timing\nwould be attempted by a Fund's shareholders or\n(b) any attempts to market time a Fund by\nshareholders would result in negative impact\nto the Fund or its shareholders. Distributions\nDividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund\nshareholder, you are entitled to your share of\nthe applicable Fund's income and net realized\ngains on its investments. Each Fund pays out\nsubstantially all of its net earnings to its\nshareholders as \u201cdistributions.\u201d Each Fund may\nearn interest from debt securities and, if\nparticipating, securities lending income. Each\nFund will generally realize short-term capital\ngains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges\nassets held for one year or less. Net short-\nterm capital gains will generally be treated\nas ordinary income when distributed to\nshareholders. Each Fund will generally realize\nlong-term capital gains or losses whenever it\nsells or exchanges assets held for more than\none year. Net capital gains (the excess of a\nFund's net long-term capital gains over its\nnet short-term capital losses) are distributed\nto shareholders as \u201ccapital gain\ndistributions.\u201d Income dividend distributions,\nif any, are generally distributed to\nshareholders monthly, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Net\ncapital gains for each Fund are distributed at\nleast annually. Dividends may be declared and\npaid more frequently or at any other time to\nimprove Index tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nA portion of each distribution may result in a\nreturn of capital. You will be notified\nregarding the portion of the distribution\nwhich represents a return of capital.\nDistributions in cash may be reinvested\nautomatically in additional whole Fund Shares\nonly if the broker through whom you purchased\nFund Shares makes such option available.\nDistributions which are reinvested will\nnevertheless be taxable to the same extent as\nif such distributions had not been reinvested.\nPortfolio Holdings Disclosure The Funds'\nportfolio holdings disclosure policy is\ndescribed in the SAI. In addition, the\nidentities and quantities of the securities\nheld by each Fund are disclosed on the Funds'\nwebsite. 59 Table of Contents Additional Tax\nInformation The following discussion is a\nsummary of some important U.S. federal income\ntax considerations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in a Fund. Your investment in a\nFund may have other tax implications. Please\nconsult your tax advisor about federal, state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax laws applicable to\nyou. Investors, including non-U.S. investors,\nmay wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. Taxes On Distributions.\nIn general, your distributions are subject to\nfederal income tax when they are paid, whether\nyou take them in cash or reinvest them in a\nFund. The income dividends and short-term\ncapital gains distributions you receive from\nthe Funds will generally be taxed as ordinary\nincome. Any distributions of a Fund's net\ncapital gains are taxable as long-term capital\ngain regardless of how long you have owned\nFund Shares. Long-term capital gains are\ngenerally taxed to noncorporate shareholders\nat reduced rates. Distributions in excess of a\nFund's current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits are treated as a tax-free return of\ncapital to the extent of your basis in the\nFund's shares, and, in general, as capital\ngain thereafter. Since the Funds primarily\nhold investments that do not pay dividends, it\nis not expected that a substantial portion (if\nany) of the dividends paid by a Fund will\nqualify for either the dividends-received\ndeduction for corporations or the favorable\nincome tax rates available to individuals on\nqualified dividend income. U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding specified thresholds are\nsubject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on\nall or a portion of their \u201cnet investment\nincome,\u201d which includes taxable interest,\ndividends and certain capital gains (generally\nincluding capital gain distributions and\ncapital gains realized upon the sale of Fund\nShares). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or\na portion of the undistributed net investment\nincome of certain shareholders that are\nestates and trusts. Certain tax-exempt\neducational institutions will be subject to a\n1.4% tax on net investment income. For these\npurposes, certain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. Distributions paid in\nJanuary, but declared by a Fund in October,\nNovember or December of the previous year,\npayable to shareholders of record in such a\nmonth, may be taxable to you in the calendar\nyear in which they were declared. The Funds\nwill inform you of the amount of your ordinary\nincome dividends and capital gain\ndistributions shortly after the close of each\ncalendar year. A distribution will reduce a\nFund's net asset value per Fund Share and may\nbe taxable to you as ordinary income or\ncapital gain even though, from an investment\nstandpoint, the distribution may constitute a\nreturn of capital. Original Issue Discount .\nInvestments by a Fund in zero coupon or other\ndiscount securities will result in income to\nthe Fund equal to a portion of the excess face\nvalue of the securities over their issue price\n(the \u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or \u201cOID\u201d) each\nyear that the securities are held, even though\nthe Fund may receive no cash interest payments\nor may receive cash interest payments that are\nless than the income recognized for tax\npurposes. In other circumstances, whether\npursuant to the terms of a security or as a\nresult of other factors outside the control of\na Fund, a Fund may recognize income without\nreceiving a commensurate amount of cash. A\nFund's share of such income is included in\ndetermining the amount that the Fund must\ndistribute to maintain its eligibility for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand to avoid the payment of federal tax,\nincluding the nondeductible 4% excise tax.\nBecause any income required to be recognized\nas a result of the OID and/or market discount\nrules (discussed below) may not be matched by\na corresponding cash payment, the Fund may be\nrequired to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to be able to make distributions to\nits shareholders in order to qualify for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand eliminate taxes at the Fund level.\nInflation-Indexed Bonds. Special rules apply\nif a Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds.\nGenerally, all stated interest on inflation-\nindexed bonds is taken into income by a Fund\nunder its regular method of accounting for\ninterest income. The amount of any positive\ninflation adjustment for a taxable year, which\nresults from an increase in the inflation-\nadjusted principal amount of the bond, is\ntreated as OID. The amount of a Fund's OID in\na taxable year with respect to a bond will\nincrease the Fund's taxable income for such\nyear without a corresponding receipt of cash\nuntil the bond matures. As a result, a Fund\nmay need to use other sources of cash to\nsatisfy its distribution requirements for such\nyear. The amount of any negative inflation\nadjustments, which result from a decrease in\nthe inflation-adjusted principal amount of the\nbond, first reduces the amount of interest\n(including stated interest, OID, and market\ndiscount, if any) otherwise 60 Table of\nContents includible in a Fund's income with\nrespect to the bond for the taxable year; any\nremaining negative adjustments will be either\ntreated as ordinary loss or, in certain\ncircumstances, carried forward to reduce the\namount of interest income taken into account\nwith respect to the bond in future taxable\nyears. Market Discount. Any market discount\nrecognized on a market discount bond is\ntaxable as ordinary income. A market discount\nbond is a bond acquired in the secondary\nmarket at a price below redemption value or\nbelow adjusted issue price if the bond was\nissued with original issue discount. Absent an\nelection by a Fund to include the market\ndiscount in income as it accrues, the gain on\nthe Fund's disposition of such an obligation\nwill be treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued\nmarket discount. Where the income required to\nbe recognized as a result of the market\ndiscount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash receipt by the Fund, the\nFund may be required to borrow money or\ndispose of securities to enable the Fund to\nmake distributions to its shareholders in\norder to qualify for treatment as a regulated\ninvestment company and eliminate taxes at the\nFund level, potentially resulting in\nadditional taxable gain or loss to the Fund.\nDerivatives and Other Complex Securities. A\nFund may invest in complex securities. These\ninvestments may be subject to numerous special\nand complex rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund\nare treated as ordinary income or capital\ngain, accelerate the recognition of income to\na Fund and/or defer a Fund's ability to\nrecognize losses. In turn, these rules may\naffect the amount, timing or character of the\nincome distributed to you by a Fund. You\nshould consult your personal tax advisor\nregarding the application of these rules.\nForeign Currency Transactions. A Fund's\ntransactions in foreign currencies, foreign\ncurrency denominated debt obligations and\ncertain foreign currency options, futures\ncontracts and forward contracts (and similar\ninstruments) may give rise to ordinary income\nor loss to the extent such income or loss\nresults from fluctuations in the value of the\nforeign currency concerned. Foreign Income\nTaxes. Investment income received by a Fund\nfrom sources within foreign countries may be\nsubject to foreign income taxes withheld at\nthe source. The United States has entered into\ntax treaties with many foreign countries which\nmay entitle a Fund to a reduced rate of such\ntaxes or exemption from taxes on such income.\nIt is impossible to determine the effective\nrate of foreign tax for a Fund in advance\nsince the amount of the assets to be invested\nwithin various countries is not known. If more\nthan 50% of the total assets of a Fund at the\nclose of its taxable year consist of certain\nforeign stocks or securities, the Fund may\nelect to \u201cpass through\u201d to you certain foreign\nincome taxes (including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund. If a Fund in which you hold\nFund Shares makes such an election, you will\nbe considered to have received as an\nadditional dividend your share of such foreign\ntaxes, but you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income, or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not so elect, the\nFund will be entitled to claim a deduction for\ncertain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund.\nUnder certain circumstances, if a Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign taxes paid in\nrespect of a prior year, the value of Fund\nShares could be affected or any foreign tax\ncredits or deductions passed through to\nshareholders in respect of the Fund's foreign\ntaxes for the current year could be reduced.\nTaxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund Shares is generally treated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for more than one year and as short-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for one year or less, except that any\ncapital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held\nfor six months or less is treated as long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect to such Fund\nShares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of\nCreation Units. A person who exchanges\nsecurities for Creation Units generally will\nrecognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss\nwill be equal to the difference between the\nmarket value of the Creation Units at the time\nand the exchanger's aggregate basis in the\nsecurities surrendered plus any cash paid for\nthe Creation Units. A person who exchanges\nCreation Units for securities will generally\nrecognize a gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between the exchanger's basis in\nthe Creation Units and the aggregate market\nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash\nreceived. The IRS, however, may assert that a\nloss realized upon an exchange of securities\nfor Creation Units cannot be deducted\ncurrently under the rules governing \u201cwash\nsales,\u201d or on the basis that there has been no\nsignificant change in economic position.\nPersons exchanging securities should consult\ntheir own tax advisor with respect to whether\nwash sale rules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. 61 Table of Contents Under current\nfederal tax laws, any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon a redemption (or creation) of\nCreation Units is generally treated as long-\nterm capital gain or loss if the applicable\nFund Shares (or securities surrendered) have\nbeen held for more than one year and as a\nshort-term capital gain or loss if the\napplicable Fund Shares (or securities\nsurrendered) have been held for one year or\nless. If you create or redeem Creation Units,\nyou will be sent a confirmation statement\nshowing how many Fund Shares you purchased or\nsold and at what price. The Trust on behalf of\neach Fund has the right to reject an order for\nCreation Units if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the applicable Fund and\nif, pursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the\napplicable Fund would have a basis in the\nsecurities different from the market value of\nthe securities on the date of deposit. The\nTrust also has the right to require\ninformation necessary to determine beneficial\nshare ownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. If the Trust does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the applicable Fund, the\npurchaser (or group of purchasers) will not\nrecognize gain or loss upon the exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units. If a Fund\nredeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear\nadditional costs and recognize more capital\ngains than it would if it redeems Creation\nUnits in-kind. Non-U.S. Investors. Ordinary\nincome dividends paid by a Fund to\nshareholders who are non-resident aliens or\nforeign entities will generally be subject to\na 30% U.S. withholding tax (other than\ndistributions reported by the Fund as\ninterest-related dividends and short-term\ncapital gain dividends), unless a lower treaty\nrate applies or unless such income is\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness. In general, a Fund may report\ninterest-related dividends to the extent of\nits net income derived from U.S. source\ninterest and a Fund may report short-term\ncapital gain dividends to the extent its net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year\nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains\non the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that\nare, in each case, effectively connected with\nthe conduct of a trade or business within the\nU.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal\nnet income taxation at regular income tax\nrates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of a\nFund's shares are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning special tax rules that\nmay apply to their investment. Unless certain\nnon-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply\nwith IRS requirements that will generally\nrequire them to report information regarding\nU.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts\nwith, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply to distributions payable to such\nentities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt\nfrom the withholding described in this\nparagraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S.\nand a foreign government, provided that the\nshareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such\nagreement. Backup Withholding. A Fund will be\nrequired in certain cases to withhold (as\n\u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts payable to\nany shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been\nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the United States.\nOther Tax Issues. A Fund may be subject to tax\nin certain states where the Fund does business\n(or is treated as doing business as a result\nof its investments). Furthermore, in those\nstates which have income tax laws, the tax\ntreatment of the Funds and of Fund\nshareholders with respect to distributions by\nthe Funds may differ from federal tax\ntreatment. The foregoing discussion summarizes\nsome of the consequences under current federal\nincome tax law of an investment in the Funds.\nIt is not a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. Consult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax consequences of an\ninvestment in the Funds under all applicable\ntax laws. 62 Table of Contents General\nInformation The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998.\nIf shareholders of any Fund are required to\nvote on any matters, shareholders are entitled\nto one vote for each Fund Share they own.\nAnnual meetings of shareholders will not be\nheld except as required by the 1940 Act and\nother applicable law. See the SAI for more\ninformation concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization Each\nFund is a separate series of the Trust, which\nis an open-end registered management\ninvestment company. From time to time, a Fund\nmay advertise yield and total return figures.\nYield is a historical measure of dividend\nincome, and total return is a measure of past\ndividend income (assuming that it has been\nreinvested) plus capital appreciation. Neither\nyield nor total return should be used to\npredict the future performance of a Fund.\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel\nto the Trust, including the Funds. Ernst &\nYoung LLP serves as the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and will audit the\nFunds' financial statements annually.\nFinancial Highlights These financial highlight\ntables are intended to help you understand\neach Fund's financial performance for the past\ntwo fiscal years ended December 31, the six-\nmonth period ended December 31, 2019 and the\nprior three fiscal years ended June 30.\nCertain information reflects the performance\nresults for a single Fund Share. The total\nreturns in the table represent the rate that\nan investor would have earned (or lost) on an\ninvestment in each Fund (assuming reinvestment\nof all dividends and distributions). This\ninformation has been audited by Ernst & Young\nLLP, the Trust's independent registered public\naccounting firm, whose report, along with each\nFund's financial highlights and financial\nstatements, is included in the annual report\nto shareholders, which is available upon\nrequest.

\n       Per share numbers have been            \n       calculated using average shares        \n  (b)  outstanding, which more appropriately  \n       presents the per share data for the    \n       year.                                  \n       Amounts shown in this caption for a    \n       share outstanding may not accord with  \n       the change in aggregate gains and      \n  (c)  losses in securities for the fiscal    \n       period because of the timing of sales  \n       and repurchases of Fund shares in      \n       relation to fluctuating market values  \n       for the Fund.                          \n       Total return is calculated assuming a  \n       purchase of shares at net asset value  \n       on the first day and a sale at net     \n       asset value on the last day of each    \n       period reported. Distributions are     \n       assumed, for the purpose of this       \n  (d)  calculation, to be reinvested at net   \n       asset value per share on the           \n       respective payment dates of each       \n       distribution. Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized. Broker commission charges  \n       are not included in this calculation.  \n       If an Affiliate had not made a         \n  (e)  contribution during the year ended     \n       June 30, 2019, the total return would  \n       have been 7.66%.                       \n  (f)  Annualized.                            \n       Portfolio turnover rate excludes       \n  (g)  securities received or delivered from  \n       in-kind processing of creations or     \n       redemptions.                           \n  (h)  Not annualized.                        \n

\n       Per share numbers have been            \n       calculated using average shares        \n  (b)  outstanding, which more appropriately  \n       presents the per share data for the    \n

in securities for the fiscal    \n       period because of the timing of sales  \n       and repurchases of Fund shares in      \n       relation to fluctuating market values  \n       for the Fund.                          \n  (d)  Amount is less than $0.005 per share.  \n       Total return is calculated assuming a  \n       purchase of shares at net asset value  \n       on the first day and a sale at net     \n       asset value on the last day of each    \n       period reported. Distributions are     \n       assumed, for the purpose of this       \n  (e)  calculation, to be reinvested at net   \n       asset value per share on the           \n       respective payment dates of each       \n       distribution. Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized. Broker commission charges  \n       are not included in this calculation.  \n  (f)  Annualized.                            \n       Portfolio turnover rate excludes       \n  (g)  securities received

The\nTrust was organized as a Massachusetts\nbusiness trust on June 12, 1998. The offering\nof each Fund\u2019s shares (\u201cShares\u201d) is registered\nunder the Securities Act of 1933, as amended\n(the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). The investment\nobjective of each Fund is to provide\ninvestment results that, before fees and\nexpenses, correspond generally to the price\nand yield performance of a specified market\nindex (each an \u201cIndex\u201d and together the\n\u201cIndexes\u201d). SSGA Funds Management, Inc. serves\nas the investment adviser for each Fund (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d) and certain funds are\nsub-advised by a sub-adviser as further\ndescribed herein (the \u201cSub-Adviser\u201d). To the\nextent that a reference in this SAI refers to\nthe \u201cAdviser,\u201d such reference should also be\nread to refer to the Sub-Adviser where the\ncontext requires.\n\nEach Fund offers and issues Shares at their\nnet asset value (sometimes referred to herein\nas \u201cNAV\u201d) only in aggregations of a specified\nnumber of Shares (each, a \u201cCreation Unit\u201d).\nEach Fund generally offers and issues Shares\neither in exchange for (i) a basket of\nsecurities designated by the Fund (\u201cDeposit\nSecurities\u201d) together with the deposit of a\nspecified cash payment (\u201cCash Component\u201d) or\n(ii) a cash payment equal in value to the\nDeposit Securities (\u201cDeposit Cash\u201d) together\nwith the Cash Component. The primary\nconsideration accepted by a Fund (i.e.,\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash) is set\nforth under \u201cPurchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units\u201d later in this SAI. The Trust\nreserves the right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of a \u201ccash in lieu\u201d amount to be\nadded to the Cash Component to replace any\nDeposit Security and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of Deposit Cash (subject to\napplicable legal requirements). The Shares\nhave been approved for listing and secondary\ntrading on a national securities exchange (the\n\u201cExchange\u201d). The Shares will trade on the\nExchange at market prices. These prices may\ndiffer from the Shares\u2019 net asset values. The\nShares are also redeemable only in Creation\nUnit aggregations, and generally in exchange\neither for (i) portfolio securities and a\nspecified cash payment or (ii) cash (subject\nto applicable legal requirements).\n\nShares may be issued in advance of receipt of\nDeposit Securities subject to various\nconditions including a requirement to maintain\non deposit with the Trust cash at least equal\nto a specified percentage of the market value\nof the missing Deposit Securities as set forth\nin the Participant Agreement (as defined\nbelow). See \u201cPurchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units.\u201d The Trust may impose a\ntransaction fee for each creation or\nredemption. In all cases, such fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d) applicable to management investment\ncompanies offering redeemable securities. In\naddition to the fixed creation or redemption\ntransaction fee, an additional transaction fee\nof up to three times the fixed creation or\nredemption transaction fee and/or an\nadditional variable charge may apply.\n                                              \n             INVESTMENT POLICIES              \n                                              \nEach Fund may invest in the following types of\ninvestments, consistent with its investment\nstrategies and objective. Please see a Fund\u2019s\nProspectus for additional information\nregarding its principal investment strategies.\n\nDIVERSIFICATION STATUS\n\nThe SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond\nETF, SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury\nBond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg Short Term\nInternational Treasury Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE\nInternational Government Inflation-Protected\nBond ETF are each classified as a \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d investment company, and the SPDR\nBloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF is\nclassified as a \u201cdiversified\u201d investment\ncompany, under the 1940 Act. Under the 1940\nAct, a diversified investment company, as to\n75% of its total assets, may not purchase\nsecurities of any issuer (other than\nsecurities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agents or instrumentalities or\nsecurities of other investment companies) if,\nas a result, more than 5% of its total assets\nwould be invested in the securities of such\nissuer, or more than 10% of the issuer\u2019s\noutstanding voting securities would be held by\nthe investment company. A \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nclassification means that a Fund is not\nlimited by the 1940 Act with regard to the\npercentage of its assets that may be invested\nin the securities of a single issuer. This\nmeans that a non-diversified Fund may invest a\ngreater portion of its assets in the\nsecurities of a single issuer than a\ndiversified fund. The securities of a\nparticular issuer may constitute a greater\nportion of an Index of a Fund and, therefore,\nthe securities may constitute a greater\nportion of the Fund\u2019s portfolio. This may have\nan adverse effect on the Fund\u2019s performance or\nsubject the Fund\u2019s Shares to greater price\nvolatility than more diversified investment\ncompanies.\n                      3                       \nEach Fund (whether diversified or non-\ndiversified for purposes of the 1940 Act)\nintends to maintain the required level of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a \u201cregulated\ninvestment company\u201d (\u201cRIC\u201d) for purposes of\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(the \u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d), and to relieve\nthe Fund of any liability for federal income\ntax to the extent that its earnings are\ndistributed to shareholders. Compliance with\nthe diversification requirements of the\nInternal Revenue Code may severely limit the\ninvestment flexibility of a Fund and may make\nit less likely that the Fund will meet its\ninvestment objective.\n\nASSET-BACKED AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED\nSECURITIES\n\nAsset-backed securities are securities backed\nby installment contracts, credit-card\nreceivables or other assets. Commercial\nmortgage-backed securities are securities\nbacked by commercial real estate properties.\nBoth asset-backed and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities represent interests in\n\u201cpools\u201d of assets in which payments of both\ninterest and principal on the securities are\nmade on a regular basis. The payments are, in\neffect, \u201cpassed through\u201d to the holder of the\nsecurities (net of any fees paid to the issuer\nor guarantor of the securities). The average\nlife of asset-backed and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities varies with the maturities\nof the underlying instruments and, as a result\nof prepayments, can often be less than the\noriginal maturity of the assets underlying the\nsecurities. For this and other reasons, an\nasset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurity\u2019s stated maturity may be shortened,\nand the security\u2019s total return may be\ndifficult to predict precisely.\n\nBONDS\n\nA bond is an interest-bearing security issued\nby a company, governmental unit or, in some\ncases, a non-U.S. entity. The issuer of a bond\nhas a contractual obligation to pay interest\nat a stated rate on specific dates and to\nrepay principal (the bond\u2019s face value)\nperiodically or on a specified maturity date;\nprovided, however, a zero coupon bond pays no\ninterest to its holder during its life. The\nvalue of a zero coupon bond to a Fund consists\nof the difference between such bond\u2019s face\nvalue at the time of maturity and the price\nfor which it was acquired, which may be an\namount significantly less than its face value\n(sometimes referred to as a \u201cdeep discount\u201d\nprice).\n\nAn issuer may have the right to redeem or\n\u201ccall\u201d a bond before maturity, in which case\nthe investor may have to reinvest the proceeds\nat lower market rates. Most bonds bear\ninterest income at a \u201ccoupon\u201d rate that is\nfixed for the life of the bond. The value of a\nfixed rate bond usually rises when market\ninterest rates fall, and falls when market\ninterest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed rate\nbond\u2019s yield (income as a percent of the\nbond\u2019s current value) may differ from its\ncoupon rate as its value rises or falls. Fixed\nrate bonds generally are also subject to\ninflation risk, which is the risk that the\nvalue of the bond or income from the bond will\nbe worth less in the future as inflation\ndecreases the value of money. This could mean\nthat, as inflation increases, the \u201creal\u201d value\nof the assets of a Fund holding fixed rate\nbonds can decline, as can the value of the\nFund\u2019s distributions. Other types of bonds\nbear income at an interest rate that is\nadjusted periodically. Because of their\nadjustable interest rates, the value of\n\u201cfloating-rate\u201d or \u201cvariable-rate\u201d bonds\nfluctuates much less in response to market\ninterest rate movements than the value of\nfixed rate bonds. A Fund may treat some of\nthese bonds as having a shorter maturity for\npurposes of calculating the weighted average\nmaturity of its investment portfolio. Bonds\nmay be senior or subordinated obligations.\nSenior obligations generally have the first\nclaim on a corporation\u2019s earnings and assets\nand, in the event of liquidation, are paid\nbefore subordinated obligations. Bonds may be\nunsecured (backed only by the issuer\u2019s general\ncreditworthiness) or secured (also backed by\nspecified collateral).\n\nThe investment return of corporate bonds\nreflects interest on the bond and changes in\nthe market value of the bond. The market value\nof a corporate bond may be affected by the\ncredit rating of the corporation, the\ncorporation\u2019s performance and perceptions of\nthe corporation in the market place. There is\na risk that the issuers of the securities may\nnot be able to meet their obligations on\ninterest or principal payments at the time\ncalled for by such a security.\n\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER\n\nCommercial paper consists of short-term,\npromissory notes issued by banks, corporations\nand other entities to finance short-term\ncredit needs. These securities generally are\ndiscounted but sometimes may be interest\nbearing.\n\nCONCENTRATION\n\nEach Fund will concentrate its investments in\nsecurities of issuers in the same industry as\nmay be necessary to approximate the\ncomposition of the Fund\u2019s underlying Index.\nThe securities of issuers in particular\nindustries may dominate the benchmark Index of\na Fund and consequently a Fund\u2019s investment\nportfolio. This may adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nperformance or subject its Shares to greater\nprice volatility than that experienced by less\nconcentrated investment companies. The Trust\u2019s\ngeneral policy is to exclude securities of the\nU.S. government and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities when measuring industry\nconcentration.\n\nIn pursuing its objective, each Fund may hold\nthe securities of a single issuer in an amount\nexceeding 10% of the market value of the\noutstanding securities of the issuer, subject\nto restrictions imposed by the Internal\nRevenue Code. In particular, as a Fund\u2019s size\ngrows and its assets increase, it will be more\nlikely to hold more than 10% of the securities\nof a single issuer if the issuer has a\nrelatively small public float as compared to\nother components in its benchmark Index.\n                      4                       \nCONVERTIBLE SECURITIES\n\nConvertible securities are bonds, debentures,\nnotes, preferred stock or other securities\nthat may be converted or exchanged (by the\nholder or by the issuer) into shares of the\nunderlying common stock (or cash or securities\nof equivalent value) at a stated exchange\nratio. A convertible security may also be\ncalled for redemption or conversion by the\nissuer after a particular date and under\ncertain circumstances (including a specified\nprice) established upon issue. If a\nconvertible security held by a Fund is called\nfor redemption or conversion, the Fund could\nbe required to tender it for redemption,\nconvert it into the underlying common stock,\nor sell it to a third party.\n\nConvertible securities generally have less\npotential for gain or loss than common stock.\nConvertible securities generally provide\nyields higher than the underlying common\nstock, but generally lower than comparable\nnon-convertible securities. Because of this\nhigher yield, convertible securities generally\nsell at a price above their \u201cconversion\nvalue,\u201d which is the current market value of\nthe stock to be received upon conversion. The\ndifference between this conversion value and\nthe price of convertible securities will vary\nover time depending on changes in the value of\nthe underlying common stock and interest\nrates. When the underlying common stock\ndeclines in value, convertible securities will\ntend not to decline to the same extent because\nof the interest or dividend payments and the\nrepayment of principal at maturity for certain\ntypes of convertible securities. However,\nsecurities that are convertible other than at\nthe option of the holder generally do not\nlimit the potential for loss to the same\nextent as securities convertible at the option\nof the holder. When the underlying common\nstock rises in value, the value of convertible\nsecurities may also be expected to increase.\nAt the same time, however, the difference\nbetween the market value of convertible\nsecurities and their conversion value will\nnarrow, which means that the value of\nconvertible securities will generally not\nincrease to the same extent as the value of\nthe underlying common stock. Because\nconvertible securities may also be interest-\nrate sensitive, their value may increase as\ninterest rates fall and decrease as interest\nrates rise. Convertible securities are also\nsubject to credit risk, and are often lower-\nquality securities.\n\nEXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS\n\nEach Fund may invest in other exchange-traded\nfunds (\u201cETFs\u201d) (including ETFs managed by the\nAdviser). ETFs may be structured as investment\ncompanies that are registered under the 1940\nAct, typically as open-end funds or unit\ninvestment trusts. These ETFs are generally\nbased on specific domestic and foreign market\nsecurities indices. An \u201cindex-based ETF\u201d seeks\nto provide investment results that match the\nperformance of an index by holding in its\nportfolio either the contents of the index or\na representative sample of the securities in\nthe index. An \u201cactively-managed ETF\u201d invests\nin securities based on an adviser\u2019s investment\nstrategy. An \u201cenhanced ETF\u201d seeks to provide\ninvestment results that match a positive or\nnegative multiple of the performance of an\nunderlying index. In seeking to provide such\nresults, an ETF and, in particular, an\nenhanced ETF, may engage in short sales of\nsecurities included in the underlying index\nand may invest in derivatives instruments,\nsuch as equity index swaps, futures contracts,\nand options on securities, futures contracts,\nand stock indices. Alternatively, ETFs may be\nstructured as grantor trusts or other forms of\npooled investment vehicles that are not\nregistered or regulated under the 1940 Act.\nThese ETFs typically hold commodities,\nprecious metals, currency or other non-\nsecurities investments. ETFs, like mutual\nfunds, have expenses associated with their\noperation, such as advisory and custody fees.\nWhen a Fund invests in an ETF, in addition to\ndirectly bearing expenses associated with its\nown operations, including the brokerage costs\nassociated with the purchase and sale of\nshares of the ETF, the Fund will bear a pro\nrata portion of the ETF\u2019s expenses. In\naddition, it may be more costly to own an ETF\nthan to directly own the securities or other\ninvestments held by the ETF because of ETF\nexpenses. The risks of owning shares of an ETF\ngenerally reflect the risks of owning the\nunderlying securities or other investments\nheld by the ETF, although lack of liquidity in\nthe market for the shares of an ETF could\nresult in the ETF\u2019s value being more volatile\nthan the underlying securities or other\ninvestments.\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS\n\nEach Fund may conduct foreign currency\ntransactions on a spot (i.e., cash) or forward\nbasis (i.e., by entering into forward\ncontracts to purchase or sell foreign\ncurrencies). Although foreign exchange dealers\ngenerally do not charge a fee for such\nconversions, they do realize a profit based on\nthe difference between the prices at which\nthey are buying and selling various\ncurrencies. Thus, a dealer may offer to sell a\nforeign currency at one rate, while offering a\nlesser rate of exchange should the\ncounterparty desire to resell that currency to\nthe dealer. Forward contracts are customized\ntransactions that generally require a specific\namount of a currency to be delivered at a\nspecific exchange rate on a specific date or\nrange of dates in the future, although the\nFunds may also enter into non-deliverable\ncurrency forward contracts (\u201cNDFs\u201d) that\ncontractually require the netting of the\nparties\u2019 liabilities. Forwards, including\nNDFs, can have substantial price volatility.\nWhile foreign currency transactions on a spot\nand forward basis are exempt from the\ndefinition of \u201cswap\u201d under the Commodity\nExchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d), NDFs are not, and, thus,\nare subject to the jurisdiction of the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d).\nForward contracts are generally traded in an\ninterbank market directly between currency\ntraders (usually large commercial banks) and\ntheir customers. The parties to a forward\ncontract may agree to offset or terminate the\ncontract before its maturity, or may hold the\ncontract to maturity and complete the\ncontemplated currency exchange. In the event\nthat the parties to a forward contract agree\nto offset or terminate the contract before its\nmaturity, the contract is no longer exempt\nfrom the definition of \u201cswap\u201d under the CEA\nand shall be treated as a swap. At the\ndiscretion of the Adviser, the Funds may enter\ninto forward currency exchange contracts for\nhedging purposes to help reduce the risks and\nvolatility caused by changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates, or to gain exposure\nto certain currencies in an effort to track\nthe composition of the applicable Index. When\nused for hedging purposes, they tend to limit\nany potential gain that may be realized if the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s foreign holdings increases\nbecause of currency fluctuations.\n                      5                       \nFUTURES CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAP AGREEMENTS\n\nEach Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets\nin derivatives, including exchange-traded\nfutures on indices, exchange-traded futures on\nTreasuries or Eurodollars, U.S. exchange-\ntraded or OTC put and call options contracts\nand exchange-traded or OTC swap transactions\n(including NDFs, interest rate swaps, total\nreturn swaps, excess return swaps, and credit\ndefault swaps). A Fund will segregate cash\nand/or appropriate liquid assets if required\nto do so by current SEC or CFTC regulation or\ninterpretation.\n\nFutures and Options on Futures. Futures\ncontracts generally provide for the future\nsale by one party and purchase by another\nparty of a specified commodity or security at\na specified future time and at a specified\nprice. Index futures contracts are settled\ndaily with a payment by one party to the other\nof a cash amount based on the difference\nbetween the level of the index specified in\nthe contract from one day to the next. A\nfutures contract on an index is an agreement\npursuant to which two parties agree to take or\nmake delivery of an amount of cash equal to\nthe difference between the value of the index\nat the close of the last trading day of the\ncontract and the price at which the index\ncontract originally was written. Although the\nvalue of an index might be a function of the\nvalue of certain specified securities,\nphysical delivery of these securities is not\nalways made. A public market exists in futures\ncontracts covering a number of indexes, as\nwell as financial instruments, including,\nwithout limitation: U.S. Treasury bonds; U.S.\nTreasury notes; GNMA Certificates; three-month\nU.S. Treasury bills; 90-day commercial paper;\nbank certificates of deposit; Eurodollar\ncertificates of deposit; the Australian\nDollar; the Canadian Dollar; the British\nPound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss Franc; the\nMexican Peso; and certain multinational\ncurrencies, such as the Euro. It is expected\nthat other futures contracts will be developed\nand traded in the future. Futures contracts\nare standardized as to maturity date and\nunderlying instrument and are traded on\nfutures exchanges.\n\nThe Funds may purchase and write (sell) call\nand put options on futures. Options on futures\ngive the holder the right, in return for the\npremium paid, to assume a long position (call)\nor short position (put) in a futures contract\nat a specified exercise price upon expiration\nof, or at any time during the period of, the\noption. Upon exercise of a call option, the\nholder acquires a long position in the futures\ncontract and the writer is assigned the\nopposite short position. In the case of a put\noption, the opposite is true.\n\nA Fund is required to make a good faith margin\ndeposit in cash or U.S. government securities\n(or other eligible collateral) with a broker\nor custodian to initiate and maintain open\npositions in futures contracts. A margin\ndeposit is intended to assure completion of\nthe contract (delivery or acceptance of the\nunderlying commodity or payment of the cash\nsettlement amount) if it is not terminated\nprior to the specified delivery date. Brokers\nmay establish deposit requirements which are\nhigher than the exchange minimums. Futures\ncontracts are customarily purchased and sold\non margin deposits which may range upward from\nless than 5% of the value of the contract\nbeing traded.\n\nAfter a futures contract position is opened,\nthe value of the contract is marked to market\ndaily. If the futures contract price changes\nto the extent that the margin on deposit does\nnot satisfy price changes, additional payments\nwill be required. Conversely, change in the\ncontract value may reduce the required margin,\nresulting in a repayment of excess margin to\nthe contract holder. Variation margin payments\nare made to and from the futures broker for as\nlong as the contract remains open. In such\ncase, a Fund would expect to earn interest\nincome on its margin deposits. Although some\nfutures contracts call for making or taking\ndelivery of the underlying commodity,\ngenerally these obligations are closed out\nprior to delivery by offsetting purchases or\nsales of matching futures contracts (involving\nthe same exchange, underlying security or\nindex and delivery month). If an offsetting\npurchase price is less than the original sale\nprice, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if\nit is more, the Fund realizes a capital loss.\nConversely, if an offsetting sale price is\nmore than the original purchase price, the\nFund realizes a capital gain, or if it is\nless, the Fund realizes a capital loss. The\ntransaction costs also must be included in\nthese calculations.\n\nOptions. A Fund may purchase and sell put and\ncall options. Such options may relate to\nparticular securities and may or may not be\nlisted on a national securities exchange and\nissued by the Options Clearing Corporation.\nOptions trading is a highly specialized\nactivity that entails greater than ordinary\ninvestment risk. Options on particular\nsecurities may be more volatile than the\nunderlying securities, and therefore, on a\npercentage basis, an investment in options may\nbe subject to greater fluctuation than an\ninvestment in the underlying securities\nthemselves.\n\nShort Sales \u201cAgainst the Box.\u201d The Funds may\nengage in short sales \u201cagainst the box.\u201d In a\nshort sale against the box, a Fund agrees to\nsell at a future date a security that it\neither contemporaneously owns or has the right\nto acquire at no extra cost. If the price of\nthe security has declined at the time the Fund\nis required to deliver the security, the Fund\nwill benefit from the difference in the price.\nIf the price of the security has increased,\nthe Fund will be required to pay the\ndifference.\n\nSwap Transactions. Each Fund may enter into\nswap transactions, including interest rate\nswap, credit default swap, NDF, and total\nreturn swap transactions. Swap transactions\nare contracts between parties in which one\nparty agrees to make periodic payments to the\nother party based on the change in market\nvalue or level of a specified rate, index or\nasset. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake payments to the first party based on the\nreturn of a different specified rate, index or\nasset. Swap transactions will usually be done\non a\n                      6                       \nnet basis, i.e., where the two parties make\nnet payments with a Fund receiving or paying,\nas the case may be, only the net amount of the\ntwo payments. The net amount of the excess, if\nany, of a Fund\u2019s obligations over its\nentitlements with respect to each swap is\naccrued on a daily basis and an amount of cash\nor equivalents having an aggregate value at\nleast equal to the accrued excess is\nmaintained by the Fund. Swaps may be used in\nconjunction with other instruments to offset\ninterest rate, currency or other underlying\nrisks. For example, interest rate swaps may be\noffset with \u201ccaps,\u201d \u201cfloors\u201d or \u201ccollars.\u201d A\n\u201ccap\u201d is essentially a call option which\nplaces a limit on the amount of floating rate\ninterest that must be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u201cfloor\u201d is essentially a\nput option which places a limit on the minimum\namount that would be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u201ccollar\u201d is essentially a\ncombination of a long cap and a short floor\nwhere the limits are set at different levels.\n\nThe use of swap transactions by a Fund entails\ncertain risks, which may be different from, or\npossibly greater than, the risks associated\nwith investing directly in the securities and\nother investments that are the referenced\nasset for the swap agreement. Swaps are highly\nspecialized instruments that require\ninvestment techniques, risk analyses, and tax\nplanning different from those associated with\nstocks, bonds, and other traditional\ninvestments. The use of a swap requires an\nunderstanding not only of the referenced\nasset, reference rate, or index, but also of\nthe swap itself, without the benefit of\nobserving the performance of the swap under\nall the possible market conditions. Because\nsome swap transactions have a leverage\ncomponent, adverse changes in the value or\nlevel of the underlying asset, reference rate,\nor index can result in a loss substantially\ngreater than the amount invested in the swap\nitself. Certain swaps have the potential for\nunlimited loss, regardless of the size of the\ninitial investment.\n\nBilateral OTC transactions differ from\nexchange-traded or cleared derivatives\ntransactions in several respects. Bilateral\nOTC transactions are transacted directly with\ndealers and not with a clearing corporation.\nWithout the availability of a clearing\ncorporation, bilateral OTC transaction pricing\nis normally done by reference to information\nfrom market makers and/or available index\ndata, which information is carefully monitored\nby the Adviser and verified in appropriate\ncases. As bilateral OTC transactions are\nentered into directly with a dealer, there is\na risk of nonperformance by the dealer as a\nresult of its insolvency or otherwise. Under\nrecently-adopted regulations by the CFTC and\nfederal banking regulators (\u201cMargin Rules\u201d), a\nFund is required to post collateral (known as\nvariation margin) to cover the mark-to-market\nexposure in respect of its uncleared swaps.\nThe Margin Rules also mandate that collateral\nin the form of initial margin be posted to\ncover potential future exposure attributable\nto uncleared swap transactions. In the event a\nFund is required to post collateral in the\nform of initial margin or variation margin in\nrespect of its uncleared swap transactions,\nall such collateral will be posted with a\nthird party custodian pursuant to a triparty\ncustody agreement between the Fund, its dealer\ncounterparty and an unaffiliated custodian.\n\nThe requirement to execute certain OTC\nderivatives contracts on SEFs may offer\ncertain advantages over traditional bilateral\nOTC trading, such as ease of execution, price\ntransparency, increased liquidity and/or\nfavorable pricing. However, SEF trading may\nmake it more difficult and costly for a Fund\nto enter into highly tailored or customized\ntransactions and may result in additional\ncosts and risks. Market participants such as\nthe Funds that execute derivatives contracts\nthrough a SEF, whether directly or through a\nbroker intermediary, are required to submit to\nthe jurisdiction of the SEF and comply with\nSEF and CFTC rules and regulations which\nimpose, among other things disclosure and\nrecordkeeping obligations. In addition, a Fund\nwill generally incur SEF or broker\nintermediary fees when it trades on a SEF. A\nFund may also be required to indemnify the SEF\nor broker intermediary for any losses or costs\nthat may result from the Fund\u2019s transactions\non the SEF.\n\nTotal Return Swaps. A Fund may enter into\ntotal return swap transactions for investment\npurposes. Total return swaps are transactions\nin which one party agrees to make periodic\npayments based on the change in market value\nof the underlying assets, which may include a\nspecified security, basket of securities or\nsecurity indexes during the specified period,\nin return for periodic payments based on a\nfixed or variable interest rate of the total\nreturn from other underlying assets. Total\nreturn swaps may be used to obtain exposure to\na security or market without owning or taking\nphysical custody of such security or market,\nincluding in cases in which there may be\ndisadvantages associated with direct ownership\nof a particular security. In a typical total\nreturn equity swap, payments made by a Fund or\nthe counterparty are based on the total return\nof a particular reference asset or assets\n(such as an equity security, a combination of\nsuch securities, or an index). That is, one\nparty agrees to pay another party the return\non a stock, basket of stocks, or stock index\nin return for a specified interest rate. By\nentering into an equity index swap, for\nexample, the index receiver can gain exposure\nto stocks making up the index of securities\nwithout actually purchasing those stocks.\nTotal return swaps involve not only the risk\nassociated with the investment in the\nunderlying securities, but also the risk of\nthe counterparty not fulfilling its\nobligations under the agreement.\n\nCredit Default Swaps. A Fund may enter into\ncredit default swap transactions for\ninvestment purposes. A credit default swap\ntransaction may have as reference obligations\none or more securities that are not currently\nheld by the Fund. A Fund may be either the\nprotection buyer or protection seller in the\ntransaction. Credit default swaps may also be\nstructured based on the debt of a basket of\nissuers, rather than a single issuer, and may\nbe customized with respect to the default\nevent that triggers purchase or other factors.\nAs a protection seller, a Fund would generally\nreceive an upfront payment or a fixed rate of\nincome throughout the term of the swap, which\ntypically is between six months and three\nyears, provided that there is no credit event.\nIf a credit event occurs, generally the\nprotection seller must pay the protection\nbuyer the full face amount of the reference\nobligations that may have little or no value.\nThe notional value of the credit default swap\nwill be used to segregate liquid assets for\nselling protection on credit default swaps. If\na Fund were a protection buyer and no credit\nevent occurred during the term of the swap,\nthe Fund would recover nothing if the swap\nwere held through its termination date.\nHowever, if a credit event occurred, the\nprotection buyer may elect to receive the full\nnotional value of\n                      7                       \nthe swap in exchange for an equal face amount\nof the reference obligation that may have\nlittle or no value. Where a Fund is the\nprotection buyer, credit default swaps involve\nthe risk that the seller may fail to satisfy\nits payment obligations to the Fund in the\nevent of a default. The purchase of credit\ndefault swaps involves costs, which will\nreduce a Fund\u2019s return. When a Fund buys\ncredit default swaps it will segregate an\namount at least equal to the amount of any\naccrued premium payment obligations including\namounts for early terminations.\n\nCurrency Swaps. A Fund may enter into currency\nswap transactions for investment purposes.\nCurrency swaps are similar to interest rate\nswaps, except that they involve multiple\ncurrencies. A Fund may enter into a currency\nswap when it has exposure to one currency and\ndesires exposure to a different currency.\nTypically, the interest rates that determine\nthe currency swap payments are fixed, although\noccasionally one or both parties may pay a\nfloating rate of interest. Unlike an interest\nrate swap, however, the principal amounts are\nexchanged at the beginning of the contract and\nreturned at the end of the contract. In\naddition to paying and receiving amounts at\nthe beginning and end of the transaction, both\nsides will have to pay in full on a periodic\nbasis based upon the currency they have\nborrowed. Change in foreign exchange rates and\nchanges in interest rates, as described above,\nmay negatively affect currency swaps.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps. A Fund may enter into an\ninterest rate swap in an effort to protect\nagainst declines in the value of fixed income\nsecurities held by the Fund. In such an\ninstance, the Fund may agree to pay a fixed\nrate (multiplied by a notional amount) while a\ncounterparty agrees to pay a floating rate\n(multiplied by the same notional amount). If\ninterest rates rise, resulting in a diminution\nin the value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio, the Fund\nwould receive payments under the swap that\nwould offset, in whole or in part, such\ndiminution in value.\n\nOptions on Swaps. An option on a swap\nagreement, or a \u201cswaption,\u201d is a contract that\ngives a counterparty the right (but not the\nobligation) to enter into a new swap agreement\nor to shorten, extend, cancel or otherwise\nmodify an existing swap agreement, at some\ndesignated future time on specified terms. In\nreturn, the purchaser pays a \u201cpremium\u201d to the\nseller of the contract. The seller of the\ncontract receives the premium and bears the\nrisk of unfavorable changes on the underlying\nswap. A Fund may write (sell) and purchase put\nand call swaptions. A Fund may also enter into\nswaptions on either an asset-based or\nliability-based basis, depending on whether\nthe Fund is hedging its assets or its\nliabilities. A Fund may write (sell) and\npurchase put and call swaptions to the same\nextent it may make use of standard options on\nsecurities or other instruments. A Fund may\nenter into these transactions primarily to\npreserve a return or spread on a particular\ninvestment or portion of its holdings, as a\nduration management technique, to protect\nagainst an increase in the price of securities\nthe Fund anticipates purchasing at a later\ndate, or for any other purposes, such as for\nspeculation to increase returns. Swaptions are\ngenerally subject to the same risks involved\nin a Fund\u2019s use of options.\n\nDepending on the terms of the particular\noption agreement, a Fund will generally incur\na greater degree of risk when it writes a\nswaption than it will incur when it purchases\na swaption. When a Fund purchases a swaption,\nit risks losing only the amount of the premium\nit has paid should it decide to let the option\nexpire unexercised. However, when a Fund\nwrites a swaption, upon exercise of the option\nthe Fund will become obligated according to\nthe terms of the underlying agreement.\n\nGovernment Regulation.The Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the\n\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) that was signed into law on\nJuly 21, 2010 created a new statutory\nframework that comprehensively regulated the\nover-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives markets\nfor the first time. Prior to the Dodd-Frank\nAct, the OTC derivatives markets were\ntraditionally traded on a bilateral basis (so-\ncalled \u201cbilateral OTC transactions\u201d). Under\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, certain OTC derivatives\ntransactions are now required to be centrally\ncleared and traded on exchanges or electronic\ntrading platforms called swap execution\nfacilities (\u201cSEFs\u201d).\n\nOn October 28, 2020, the SEC adopted Rule\n18f-4 (the \u201cDerivatives Rule\u201d) under the 1940\nAct which, following an implementation period,\nwill replace existing SEC and staff guidance\nwith an updated, comprehensive framework for\nregistered funds\u2019 use of derivatives. Among\nother changes, the Derivatives Rule will\nrequire the Funds to trade derivatives and\ncertain other instruments that create future\npayment or delivery obligations subject to a\nvalue-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d) leverage limit, develop\nand implement a derivatives risk management\nprogram and new testing requirements, and\ncomply with new requirements related to board\nand SEC reporting. These new requirements will\napply unless a Fund qualifies as a \u201climited\nderivatives user,\u201d as defined in the\nDerivatives Rule. To the extent a Fund uses\nderivatives, complying with the Derivatives\nRule may increase the cost of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments and cost of doing business, which\ncould adversely affect investors. Other new\nregulations could adversely affect the value,\navailability and performance of certain\nderivative instruments, may make them more\ncostly, and may limit or restrict their use by\nthe Funds.\n\nRegulation Under the Commodity Exchange Act.\nEach Fund intends to use commodity interests,\nsuch as futures, swaps and options on futures\nin accordance with Rule 4.5 of the CEA. A Fund\nmay use exchange-traded futures and options on\nfutures, together with positions in cash and\nmoney market instruments, to simulate full\ninvestment in its underlying Index. Exchange-\ntraded futures and options on futures\ncontracts may not be currently available for\nan Index. Under such circumstances, the\nAdviser may seek to utilize other instruments\nthat it believes to be correlated to the\napplicable Index components or a subset of the\ncomponents. An exclusion from the definition\nof the term \u201ccommodity pool operator\u201d has been\nclaimed with respect to each series of the\nTrust in accordance with Rule 4.5 such that\nregistration or regulation as a commodity pool\noperator under the CEA is not necessary.\n                      8                       \nRestrictions on Trading in Commodity\nInterests. Each Fund reserves the right to\nengage in transactions involving futures,\noptions thereon and swaps to the extent\nallowed by the CFTC regulations in effect from\ntime to time and in accordance with a Fund\u2019s\npolicies. Each Fund would take steps to\nprevent its futures positions from\n\u201cleveraging\u201d its securities holdings. When it\nhas a long futures position, it will maintain\nwith its custodian bank assets substantially\nidentical to those underlying the contract or\ncash and equivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under the contract\n(less the value of any margin deposits in\nconnection with the position). When it has a\nshort futures position, it will maintain with\nits custodian bank assets substantially\nidentical to those underlying the contract or\ncash and equivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under the contract\n(less the value of any margin deposits in\nconnection with the position).\n\nCertain additional risk factors related to\nderivatives are discussed below:\n\nDerivatives Risk. Under recently adopted rules\nby the CFTC, transactions in some types of\ninterest rate swaps and index credit default\nswaps on North American and European indices\nare required to be cleared. In addition, the\nCFTC may promulgate additional regulations\nthat require clearing of other classes of\nswaps. In a cleared derivatives transaction\n(which includes commodities futures and\ncleared swaps transactions), a Fund\u2019s\ncounterparty is a clearing house (such as CME,\nICE Clear Credit or LCH.Clearnet), rather than\na bank or broker. Since each Fund is not a\nmember of a clearing house and only members of\na clearing house can participate directly in\nthe clearing house, a Fund holds cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers, who are futures commission merchants\nthat are members of the clearing houses and\nwho have the appropriate regulatory approvals\nto engage in cleared swap transactions. A Fund\nmakes and receives payments owed under cleared\nderivatives transactions (including margin\npayments) through its accounts at clearing\nmembers. Clearing members guarantee\nperformance of their clients\u2019 obligations to\nthe clearing house. In contrast to bilateral\nOTC transactions, clearing members generally\ncan require termination of existing cleared\nderivatives transactions at any time and\nincreases in margin above the margin that it\nrequired at the beginning of a transaction.\nClearing houses also have broad rights to\nincrease margin requirements for existing\ntransactions and to terminate transactions.\nAny such increase or termination could\ninterfere with the ability of a Fund to pursue\nits investment strategy. Also, a Fund is\nsubject to execution risk if it enters into a\nderivatives transaction that is required to be\ncleared (or that the Advisor expects to be\ncleared), and no clearing member is willing or\nable to clear the transaction on the Fund\u2019s\nbehalf. While the documentation in place\nbetween a Fund and their clearing members\ngenerally provides that the clearing members\nwill accept for clearing all transactions\nsubmitted for clearing that are within credit\nlimits specified by the clearing members in\nadvance, the Fund could be subject to this\nexecution risk if the Fund submits for\nclearing transactions that exceed such credit\nlimits, if the clearing house does not accept\nthe transactions for clearing, or if the\nclearing members do not comply with their\nagreement to clear such transactions. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the benefit of any increase in the\nvalue of the transaction after the time of the\ntransaction. In addition, new regulations\ncould, among other things, restrict a Fund\u2019s\nability to engage in, or increase the cost to\nthe Fund of, derivatives transactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available to the Fund or increasing\nmargin or capital requirements. If a Fund is\nnot able to enter into a particular\nderivatives transaction, the Fund\u2019s investment\nperformance and risk profile could be\nadversely affected as a result.\n\nCounterparty Risk. Counterparty risk with\nrespect to OTC derivatives may be affected by\nnew regulations promulgated by the CFTC and\nSEC affecting the derivatives market. As\ndescribed under \u201cDerivatives Risk\u201d above, some\nderivatives transactions are required to be\ncleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives\ntransaction is subject to the credit risk of\nthe clearing house and the clearing member\nthrough which it holds its cleared derivatives\nposition, rather than the credit risk of its\noriginal counterparty to the derivative\ntransaction. Clearing members are required to\nsegregate all funds received from customers\nwith respect to cleared derivatives\ntransactions from the clearing member\u2019s\nproprietary assets. However, all funds and\nother property received by a clearing broker\nfrom its customers are generally held by the\nclearing broker on a commingled basis in an\nomnibus account, which may also invest those\nfunds in certain instruments permitted under\nthe applicable regulations. Also, the clearing\nmember transfers to the clearing house the\namount of margin required by the clearing\nhouse for cleared derivatives transactions,\nwhich amounts are generally held in the\nrelevant omnibus account at the clearing house\nfor all customers of the clearing member.\n\nFor commodities futures positions, the\nclearing house may use all of the collateral\nheld in the clearing member\u2019s omnibus account\nto meet a loss in that account, without regard\nto which customer in fact supplied that\ncollateral. Accordingly, in addition to\nbearing the credit risk of its clearing\nmember, each customer to a futures transaction\nalso bears \u201cfellow customer\u201d risk from other\ncustomers of the clearing member. However,\nwith respect to cleared swaps positions,\nrecent regulations promulgated by the CFTC\nrequire that the clearing member notify the\nclearing house of the amount of initial margin\nprovided by the clearing member to the\nclearing house that is attributable to each\ncustomer. Because margin in respect of cleared\nswaps must be earmarked for specific clearing\nmember customers, the clearing house may not\nuse the collateral of one customer to cover\nthe obligations of another customer. However,\nif the clearing member does not provide\naccurate reporting, a Fund is subject to the\nrisk that a clearing house will use the Fund\u2019s\nassets held in an omnibus account at the\nclearing house to satisfy payment obligations\nof a defaulting customer of the clearing\nmember to the clearing house. In addition,\nclearing members may generally choose to\nprovide to the clearing house the net amount\nof variation margin required for cleared swaps\nfor all of its customers in the aggregate,\nrather than the gross amount for each\ncustomer.\n                      9                       \nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nA Fund may take advantage of opportunities in\nthe area of options and futures contracts,\noptions on futures contracts, warrants, swaps\n\nand any other investments which are not\npresently contemplated for use by the Fund or\nwhich are not currently available but which\nmay be developed, to the extent such\nopportunities are both consistent with the\nFund\u2019s investment objective and legally\npermissible for the Fund. Before entering into\nsuch transactions or making any such\ninvestment, a Fund will provide appropriate\ndisclosure.\n\nHIGH YIELD SECURITIES\n\nInvestment in high yield securities (commonly\nknown as \u201cjunk\u201d bonds) generally provides\ngreater income and increased opportunity for\ncapital appreciation than investments in\nhigher quality securities, but they also\ntypically entail greater price volatility and\ncredit risk. These high yield securities are\nregarded as predominantly speculative with\nrespect to the issuer\u2019s continuing ability to\nmeet principal and interest payments. Analysis\nof the creditworthiness of issuers of debt\nsecurities that are high yield may be more\ncomplex than for issuers of higher quality\ndebt securities. In addition, high yield\nsecurities are often issued by smaller, less\ncreditworthy companies or by highly leveraged\n(indebted) firms, but can also be issued by\ngovernments. Such issuers are generally less\nable than more financially stable issuers to\nmake scheduled payments of interest and\nprincipal. The risks posed by securities\nissued under such circumstances are\nsubstantial.\n\nInvesting in high yield debt securities\ninvolves risks that are greater than the risks\nof investing in higher quality debt\nsecurities. These risks include: (i) changes\nin credit status, including weaker overall\ncredit conditions of issuers and risks of\ndefault; (ii) industry, market and economic\nrisk; and (iii) greater price variability and\ncredit risks of certain high yield securities\nsuch as zero coupon and payment-in-kind\nsecurities. While these risks provide the\nopportunity for maximizing return over time,\nthey may result in greater volatility of the\nvalue of the Fund than a fund that invests in\nhigher-rated securities.\n\nFurthermore, the value of high yield\nsecurities may be more susceptible to real or\nperceived adverse economic, company or\nindustry conditions than is the case for\nhigher quality securities. The market values\nof certain of these lower-rated and unrated\ndebt securities tend to reflect individual\nissuer developments to a greater extent than\ndo higher-rated securities which react\nprimarily to fluctuations in the general level\nof interest rates, and tend to be more\nsensitive to economic conditions than are\nhigher-rated securities. Adverse market,\ncredit or economic conditions could make it\ndifficult at certain times to sell certain\nhigh yield securities held by the Fund.\n\nThe secondary market on which high yield\nsecurities are traded may be less liquid than\nthe market for higher grade securities. Less\nliquidity in the secondary trading market\ncould adversely affect the price at which a\nFund could sell a high yield security, and\ncould adversely affect the daily net asset\nvalue per share of a Fund. When secondary\nmarkets for high yield securities are less\nliquid than the market for higher grade\nsecurities, it may be more difficult to value\nthe securities because there is less reliable,\nobjective data available.\n\nThe use of credit ratings as a principal\nmethod of selecting high yield securities can\ninvolve certain risks. For example, credit\nratings evaluate the safety of principal and\ninterest payments, not the market value risk\nof high yield securities. Also, credit rating\nagencies may fail to change credit ratings in\na timely fashion to reflect events since the\nsecurity was last rated.\n\nILLIQUID INVESTMENTS\n\nEach Fund may invest in illiquid investments.\nA Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment\nif, immediately after the acquisition, the\nFund would have invested more than 15% of its\nnet assets in illiquid investments. An\nilliquid investment means any investment that\na Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or\ndisposed of in current market conditions in\nseven calendar days or less without the sale\nor disposition significantly changing the\nmarket value of the investment. If illiquid\ninvestments exceed 15% of a Fund\u2019s net assets,\ncertain remedial actions will be taken as\nrequired by Rule 22e-4 under the 1940 Act and\nthe Funds\u2019 policies and procedures.\n\nINFLATION-PROTECTED OBLIGATIONS\n\nEach Fund may invest in inflation-protected\npublic obligations, commonly known as \u201cTIPS,\u201d\nof the U.S. Treasury, as well as TIPS of major\ngovernments and emerging market countries,\nexcluding the United States. TIPS are a type\nof security issued by a government that are\ndesigned to provide inflation protection to\ninvestors. TIPS are income-generating\ninstruments whose interest and principal\npayments are adjusted for inflation\u2014a\nsustained increase in prices that erodes the\npurchasing power of money. The inflation\nadjustment, which is typically applied monthly\nto the principal of the bond, follows a\ndesignated inflation index, such as the\nConsumer Price Index. A fixed coupon rate is\napplied to the inflation-adjusted principal so\nthat as inflation rises or falls, both the\nprincipal value and the interest payments will\nincrease or decrease. This can provide\ninvestors with a hedge against inflation, as\nit helps preserve the purchasing power of an\ninvestment. Because of this inflation\nadjustment feature, inflation-protected bonds\ntypically have lower yields than conventional\nfixed-rate bonds.\n                      10                      \nINVESTMENT COMPANIES\n\nEach Fund may invest in the securities of\nother investment companies, including\naffiliated funds and money market funds,\nsubject to applicable limitations under\nSection 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to\nSection 12(d)(1), a Fund may invest in the\nsecurities of\n\nanother investment company (the \u201cacquired\ncompany\u201d) provided that the Fund, immediately\nafter such purchase or acquisition, does not\nown in the aggregate: (i) more than 3% of the\ntotal outstanding voting stock of the acquired\ncompany; (ii) securities issued by the\nacquired company having an aggregate value in\nexcess of 5% of the value of the total assets\nof the Fund; or (iii) securities issued by the\nacquired company and all other investment\ncompanies (other than Treasury stock of the\nFund) having an aggregate value in excess of\n10% of the value of the total assets of the\nFund. To the extent allowed by law,\nregulation, and/or a Fund\u2019s investment\nrestrictions, a Fund may invest its assets in\nsecurities of investment companies, including\naffiliated funds and/or money market funds, in\nexcess of the limits discussed above.\n\nIf a Fund invests in and, thus, is a\nshareholder of, another investment company,\nthe Fund\u2019s shareholders will indirectly bear\nthe Fund\u2019s proportionate share of the fees and\nexpenses paid by such other investment\ncompany, including advisory fees, in addition\nto both the management fees payable directly\nby the Fund to the Fund\u2019s own investment\nadviser and the other expenses that the Fund\nbears directly in connection with the Fund\u2019s\nown operations.\n\nLENDING PORTFOLIO SECURITIES\n\nEach Fund may lend portfolio securities to\ncertain creditworthy borrowers in U.S. and\nnon-U.S. markets in an amount not to exceed\n40% of the value of its net assets. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is marked to\nmarket daily in an amount at least equal to\nthe current market value of the securities\nloaned. A Fund may terminate a loan at any\ntime and obtain the securities loaned. A Fund\nreceives the value of any interest or cash or\nnon-cash distributions paid on the loaned\nsecurities. A Fund cannot vote proxies for\nsecurities on loan, but may recall loans to\nvote proxies if a material issue affecting the\nFund\u2019s economic interest in the investment is\nto be voted upon. Efforts to recall such\nsecurities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly\ntraded securities, and may involve expenses to\na Fund. Distributions received on loaned\nsecurities in lieu of dividend payments (i.e.,\nsubstitute payments) would not be considered\nqualified dividend income.\n\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized\nby cash, the borrower will be entitled to\nreceive a fee based on the amount of cash\ncollateral. A Fund is compensated by the\ndifference between the amount earned on the\nreinvestment of cash collateral and the fee\npaid to the borrower. In the case of\ncollateral other than cash, a Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral may\nbe reinvested in certain high quality short-\nterm instruments either directly on behalf of\nthe lending Fund or through one or more joint\naccounts or funds, which may include those\nmanaged by the Adviser. A Fund could lose\nmoney due to a decline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned securities or\nany investments made with cash collateral.\nCertain non-cash collateral or investments\nmade with cash collateral may have a greater\nrisk of loss than other non-cash collateral or\ninvestments.\n\nA Fund may pay a portion of the interest or\nfees earned from securities lending to a\nborrower as described above, and to one or\nmore securities lending agents approved by the\nBoard of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201cBoard\u201d)\nwho administer the lending program for the\nFunds in accordance with guidelines approved\nby the Board. In such capacity, the lending\nagent provides the following services to the\nFunds in connection with the Funds\u2019 securities\nlending activities: (i) locating borrowers\namong an approved list of prospective\nborrowers; (ii) causing the delivery of loaned\nsecurities from a Fund to borrowers; (iii)\nmonitoring the value of loaned securities, the\nvalue of collateral received, and other\nlending parameters; (iv) seeking additional\ncollateral, as necessary, from borrowers; (v)\nreceiving and holding collateral from\nborrowers, and facilitating the investment and\nreinvestment of all or substantially all cash\ncollateral in an investment vehicle designated\nby the Funds; (vi) returning collateral to\nborrowers; (vii) facilitating substitute\ndividend, interest, and other distribution\npayments to the Funds from borrowers; (viii)\nnegotiating the terms of each loan of\nsecurities, including but not limited to the\namount of any loan premium, and monitoring the\nterms of securities loan agreements with\nprospective borrowers for consistency with the\nrequirements of the Funds\u2019 Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement; (ix) selecting\nsecurities, including amounts (percentages),\nto be loaned; (x) recordkeeping and accounting\nservicing; and (xi) arranging for return of\nloaned securities to the Fund in accordance\nwith the terms of the Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement. State Street Bank and\nTrust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d), an affiliate\nof the Trust, has been approved by the Board\nto serve as securities lending agent for a\nFund and the Trust has entered into an\nagreement with State Street for such services.\nAmong other matters, the Trust has agreed to\nindemnify State Street for certain\nliabilities. State Street has received an\norder of exemption from the SEC under Sections\n17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the 1940 Act to serve\nas the lending agent for affiliated investment\ncompanies such as the Trust and to invest the\ncash collateral received from loan\ntransactions to be invested in an affiliated\ncash collateral fund.\n\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess especially so in certain international\nmarkets such as Taiwan), \u201cgap\u201d risk (i.e., the\nrisk of a mismatch between the return on cash\ncollateral reinvestments and the fees a Fund\nhas agreed to pay a borrower), risk of loss of\ncollateral, credit, legal, counterparty and\nmarket risk. If a securities lending\ncounterparty were to default, a Fund would be\nsubject to the risk of a possible delay in\nreceiving collateral or in recovering the\nloaned securities, or to a possible loss of\nrights in the collateral. In the event a\nborrower does not return a Fund\u2019s securities\nas agreed, the Fund may experience losses if\nthe proceeds received from liquidating the\ncollateral do not at least equal the value of\nthe loaned security at the time the collateral\nis liquidated, plus the transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nAlthough State Street has agreed to provide a\nFund with indemnification in the event of a\nborrower default, a Fund is still exposed to\nthe risk of losses in the event a borrower\ndoes not return a Fund\u2019s securities as agreed.\nFor example, delays in recovery of lent\nsecurities may cause a Fund to lose the\nopportunity to sell the securities at a\ndesirable price.\n                      11                      \nLEVERAGING\n\nWhile the Funds do not anticipate doing so, a\nFund may borrow money in an amount greater\nthan 5% of the value of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets. However, under normal circumstances, a\nFund will not borrow money from a bank in an\namount greater than 10% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s total assets. Borrowing for investment\npurposes is one form of leverage. Leveraging\ninvestments, by purchasing securities with\nborrowed money, is a speculative technique\nthat increases investment risk, but also\nincreases investment opportunity. Because\nsubstantially all of a Fund\u2019s assets will\nfluctuate in value, whereas the interest\nobligations on borrowings may be fixed, the\nNAV of a Fund will increase more when such\nFund\u2019s portfolio assets increase in value and\ndecrease more when the Fund\u2019s portfolio assets\ndecrease in value than would otherwise be the\ncase. Moreover, interest costs on borrowings\nmay fluctuate with changing market rates of\ninterest and may partially offset or exceed\nthe returns on the borrowed funds.\n\nOTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS\n\nEach Fund may invest in short-term\ninstruments, including money market\ninstruments, (including money market funds\nadvised by the Adviser), cash and cash\nequivalents, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by the Adviser); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit\n(\u201cCDs\u201d), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed time\ndeposits and other obligations of U.S. and\nforeign banks (including foreign branches) and\nsimilar institutions; (iv) commercial paper\nrated at the date of purchase \u201cPrime-1\u201d by\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) or \u201cA-1\u201d\nby S&P Global Ratings (\u201cS&P\u201d), or if unrated,\nof comparable quality as determined by the\nAdviser; (v) non-convertible corporate debt\nsecurities (e.g., bonds and debentures) with\nremaining maturities at the date of purchase\nof not more than 397 days and that present\nminimal credit risk; and (vi) short-term U.S.\ndollar-denominated obligations of foreign\nbanks (including U.S. branches) that, in the\nopinion of the Adviser, are of comparable\nquality to obligations of U.S. banks which may\nbe purchased by a Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or a\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in connection with\ninternational transactions. Money market\ninstruments also include shares of money\nmarket funds. The SEC and other government\nagencies continue to review the regulation of\nmoney market funds. The SEC has adopted\nchanges to the rules that govern money market\nfunds, and compliance with many of these\namendments was required in October 2016.\nLegislative developments may also affect money\nmarket funds. These changes and developments\nmay affect the investment strategies,\nperformance, yield, operating expenses and\ncontinued viability of a money market fund.\n\nPRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND RESTRICTED SECURITIES\n\nEach Fund may invest in securities that are\npurchased in private placements and,\naccordingly, are subject to restrictions on\nresale as a matter of contract or under\nfederal securities laws. While such private\nplacements may offer attractive opportunities\nfor investment not otherwise available on the\nopen market, the securities so purchased are\noften \u201crestricted securities,\u201d i.e.,\nsecurities which cannot be sold to the public\nwithout registration under the Securities Act\nor the availability of an exemption from\nregistration (such as Rules 144 or 144A), or\nwhich are not readily marketable because they\nare subject to other legal or contractual\ndelays in or restrictions on resale. Generally\nspeaking, restricted securities may be sold\nonly to qualified institutional buyers, or in\na privately negotiated transaction to a\nlimited number of purchasers, or in limited\nquantities after they have been held for a\nspecified period of time and other conditions\nare met pursuant to an exemption from\nregistration, or in a public offering for\nwhich a registration statement is in effect\nunder the Securities Act.\n\nBecause there may be relatively few potential\npurchasers for such investments, especially\nunder adverse market or economic conditions or\nin the event of adverse changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuer, a Fund\ncould find it more difficult to sell such\nsecurities when the Adviser believes it\nadvisable to do so or may be able to sell such\nsecurities only at prices lower than if such\nsecurities were more widely held. Market\nquotations for such securities are generally\nless readily available than for publicly\ntraded securities. The absence of a trading\nmarket can make it difficult to ascertain a\nmarket value for such securities for purposes\nof computing a Fund\u2019s net asset value, and the\njudgment of the Adviser may at times play a\ngreater role in valuing these securities than\nin the case of publicly traded securities.\nDisposing of such securities, which may be\nilliquid investments, can involve time-\nconsuming negotiation and legal expenses, and\nit may be difficult or impossible for a Fund\nto sell them promptly at an acceptable price.\nA Fund may have to bear the extra expense of\nregistering such securities for resale and the\nrisk of substantial delay in effecting such\nregistration.\n\nA Fund may be deemed to be an \u201cunderwriter\u201d\nfor purposes of the Securities Act when\nselling restricted securities to the public,\nand in such event the Fund may be liable to\npurchasers of such securities if the\nregistration statement prepared by the issuer,\nor the prospectus forming a part of it, is\nmaterially inaccurate or misleading.\n                      12                      \nRATINGS\n\nAn investment grade rating means the security\nor issuer is rated investment grade by\nMoody\u2019s, S&P, Fitch Ratings, Inc. (\u201cFitch\u201d),\nDominion Bond Rating Service Limited, or\nanother credit rating agency designated as a\nnationally recognized statistical rating\norganization by the SEC, or is unrated but\nconsidered to be of equivalent quality by the\nAdviser or applicable Sub-Adviser.\n\nSubsequent to purchase by a Fund, a rated\nsecurity may cease to be rated or its\ninvestment grade rating may be reduced below\nan investment grade rating. Bonds rated lower\nthan Baa3 by Moody\u2019s or BBB- by S&P or Fitch\nare below investment grade quality and are\nobligations of issuers that are considered\npredominantly speculative with respect to the\nissuer\u2019s capacity to pay interest and repay\nprincipal according to the terms of the\nobligation and, therefore, carry greater\ninvestment risk, including the possibility of\nissuer default and bankruptcy and increased\nmarket price volatility. Such securities\n(\u201clower rated securities\u201d) are commonly\nreferred to as \u201cjunk bonds\u201d and are subject to\na substantial degree of credit risk. Lower\nrated securities are often issued by smaller,\nless creditworthy companies or by highly\nleveraged (indebted) firms, which are\ngenerally less able than more financially\nstable firms to make scheduled payments of\ninterest and principal. The risks posed by\nsecurities issued under such circumstances are\nsubstantial. Bonds rated below investment\ngrade tend to be less marketable than higher-\nquality bonds because the market for them is\nless broad. The market for unrated bonds is\neven narrower. See \u201cHIGH YIELD SECURITIES\u201d\nabove for more information relating to the\nrisks associated with investing in lower rated\nsecurities, or Appendix C for more information\non the ratings of debt instruments.\n\nREPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nEach Fund may invest in repurchase agreements\nwith commercial banks, brokers or dealers to\ngenerate income from its excess cash balances\nand to invest securities lending cash\ncollateral. A repurchase agreement is an\nagreement under which a Fund acquires a\nfinancial instrument (e.g., a security issued\nby the U.S. government or an agency thereof, a\nbanker\u2019s acceptance or a certificate of\ndeposit) from a seller, subject to resale to\nthe seller at an agreed upon price and date\n(normally, the next Business Day\u2014as defined\nbelow). A repurchase agreement may be\nconsidered a loan collateralized by\nsecurities. The resale price reflects an\nagreed upon interest rate effective for the\nperiod the instrument is held by a Fund and is\nunrelated to the interest rate on the\nunderlying instrument.\n\nIn these repurchase agreement transactions,\nthe securities acquired by a Fund (including\naccrued interest earned thereon) must have a\ntotal value in excess of the value of the\nrepurchase agreement and are held by the\nCustodian until repurchased. No more than an\naggregate of 15% of a Fund\u2019s net assets will\nbe invested in illiquid investments, including\nrepurchase agreements having maturities longer\nthan seven days and securities subject to\nlegal or contractual restrictions on resale,\nor for which there are no readily available\nmarket quotations.\n\nThe use of repurchase agreements involves\ncertain risks. For example, if the other party\nto the agreement defaults on its obligation to\nrepurchase the underlying security at a time\nwhen the value of the security has declined, a\nFund may incur a loss upon disposition of the\nsecurity. If the other party to the agreement\nbecomes insolvent and subject to liquidation\nor reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode or other laws, a court may determine that\nthe underlying security is collateral for a\nloan by a Fund not within the control of the\nFund and, therefore, the Fund may not be able\nto substantiate its interest in the underlying\nsecurity and may be deemed an unsecured\ncreditor of the other party to the agreement.\n\nREVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nEach Fund may enter into reverse repurchase\nagreements, which involve the sale of\nsecurities with an agreement to repurchase the\nsecurities at an agreed-upon price, date and\ninterest payment and have the characteristics\nof borrowing. The securities purchased with\nthe funds obtained from the agreement and\nsecurities collateralizing the agreement will\nhave maturity dates no later than the\nrepayment date. Generally the effect of such\ntransactions is that a Fund can recover all or\nmost of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases a Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are only\nadvantageous if a Fund has an opportunity to\nearn a greater rate of interest on the cash\nderived from these transactions than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available and a Fund intends to use\nthe reverse repurchase technique only when the\nAdviser believes it will be advantageous to\nthe Fund. The use of reverse repurchase\nagreements may exaggerate any interim increase\nor decrease in the value of a Fund\u2019s assets. A\nFund\u2019s exposure to reverse repurchase\nagreements will be covered by securities\nhaving a value equal to or greater than such\ncommitments. Under the 1940 Act, reverse\nrepurchase agreements are considered\nborrowings. Although there is no percentage\nlimit on Fund assets that can be used in\nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements,\nthe Funds do not expect to engage, under\nnormal circumstances, in reverse repurchase\nagreements with respect to more than 10% of\ntheir respective total assets.\n                      13                      \nSOVEREIGN DEBT OBLIGATIONS\n\nSovereign debt obligations are issued or\nguaranteed by foreign governments or their\nagencies. Sovereign debt may be in the form of\nconventional securities or other types of debt\ninstruments such as loans or loan\nparticipations. Governmental entities\nresponsible for repayment of the debt may be\nunable or unwilling to repay principal and pay\ninterest when due, and may require\nrenegotiation or\n\nreschedule of debt payments. In addition,\nprospects for repayment of principal and\npayment of interest may depend on political as\nwell as economic factors. Although some\nsovereign debt, such as Brady Bonds, is\ncollateralized by U.S. Government securities,\nrepayment of principal and payment of interest\nis not guaranteed by the U.S. Government.\n\nU.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nU.S. Government obligations are a type of\nbond. U.S. Government obligations include\nsecurities issued or guaranteed as to\nprincipal and interest by the U.S. Government,\nits agencies or instrumentalities.\n\nOne type of U.S. Government obligation, U.S.\nTreasury obligations, are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. Treasury and\ndiffer only in their interest rates,\nmaturities, and times of issuance. U.S.\nTreasury bills have initial maturities of one-\nyear or less; U.S. Treasury notes have initial\nmaturities of one to ten years; and U.S.\nTreasury bonds generally have initial\nmaturities of greater than ten years.\n\nOther U.S. Government obligations are issued\nor guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities\nof the U.S. Government including, but not\nlimited to, Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d), the Government\nNational Mortgage Association (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d),\nthe Small Business Administration, the Federal\nFarm Credit Administration, the Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d), the\nFederal Home Loan Banks (\u201cFHLB\u201d), Banks for\nCooperatives (including the Central Bank for\nCooperatives), the Federal Land Banks, the\nFederal Intermediate Credit Banks, the\nTennessee Valley Authority, the Export-Import\nBank of the United States, the Commodity\nCredit Corporation, the Federal Financing\nBank, the Student Loan Marketing Association,\nthe National Credit Union Administration and\nthe Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation\n(Farmer Mac). Some obligations issued or\nguaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and\ninstrumentalities, including, for example,\nGinnie Mae pass-through certificates, are\nsupported by the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. Treasury. Other obligations issued by or\nguaranteed by federal agencies, such as those\nsecurities issued by Fannie Mae, are supported\nby the discretionary authority of the U.S.\nGovernment to purchase certain obligations of\nthe federal agency, while other obligations\nissued by or guaranteed by federal agencies,\nsuch as those of the Federal Home Loan Banks,\nare supported by the right of the issuer to\nborrow from the U.S. Treasury. While the U.S.\nGovernment provides financial support to such\nU.S. Government-sponsored federal agencies, no\nassurance can be given that the U.S.\nGovernment will always do so, since the U.S.\nGovernment is not so obligated by law.\n\nIn September 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced\na federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac, placing the two federal instrumentalities\nin conservatorship. Under the terms of the\ntakeover, the U.S. Treasury agreed to acquire\n$1 billion of senior preferred stock of each\ninstrumentality and obtained warrants for the\npurchase of common stock of each\ninstrumentality. Under these Senior Preferred\nStock Purchase Agreements (\u201cSPAs\u201d), the U.S.\nTreasury has pledged to provide a limited\namount of capital per instrumentality as\nneeded, including the contribution of cash\ncapital to the instrumentalities in the event\ntheir liabilities exceed their assets. In May\n2009, the U.S. Treasury increased its maximum\ncommitment to each instrumentality under the\nSPAs from $100 billion to $200 billion per\ninstrumentality. In December 2009, the U.S.\nTreasury amended the SPAs to provide Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac with some additional\nflexibility to meet the requirement to reduce\ntheir mortgage portfolios. Also in December\n2009, the U.S. Treasury further amended the\nSPAs to allow the cap on the U.S. Treasury\u2019s\nfunding commitment to increase as necessary to\naccommodate any cumulative reduction in Fannie\nMae\u2019s and Freddie Mac\u2019s net worth through the\nend of 2012. On August 17, 2012, the U.S.\nTreasury announced that it was again amending\nthe SPAs to terminate the requirement that\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac each pay a 10%\ndividend annually on all amounts received\nunder the funding commitment. Instead, they\nwere required to transfer to the U.S. Treasury\non a quarterly basis all profits earned during\na quarter that exceeded a capital reserve\namount of $3 billion. On September 30, 2019,\nthe U.S. Treasury announced amendments to the\nSPAs permitting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to\nmaintain capital reserves of $25 billion and\n$20 billion, respectively. It is believed that\nthe amendment puts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nin a better position to service their debt\nbecause the companies no longer have to borrow\nfrom the U.S. Treasury to make fixed dividend\npayments.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the subject of\nseveral continuing class action lawsuits and\ninvestigations by federal regulators over\ncertain accounting, disclosure or corporate\ngovernance matters, which (along with any\nresulting financial restatements) may\nadversely affect the guaranteeing entities.\nImportantly, the future of the entities is in\nserious question as the U.S. government\nreportedly is considering multiple options,\nranging from nationalization, privatization,\nconsolidation, or abolishment of the entities.\n\nVARIABLE AND FLOATING RATE SECURITIES\n\nVariable rate securities are instruments\nissued or guaranteed by entities such as (1)\nUS Government, or an agency or instrumentality\nthereof, (2) states, municipalities and other\npolitical subdivisions, agencies, authorities\nand instrumentalities or states and multi-\nstate agencies or authorities (3)\ncorporations, (4) financial institutions, (5)\ninsurance companies or (6) trusts that have a\nrate of interest subject to adjustment at\nregular intervals but less frequently than\nannually. A variable rate security provides\nfor the automatic establishment of a new\ninterest rate on set dates. Variable rate\nobligations whose interest is readjusted no\nless frequently than annually will be deemed\nto have a maturity equal to the period\nremaining until the next readjustment of the\ninterest rate. The Funds may also purchase\nfloating rate securities. A floating rate\nsecurity provides for the automatic adjustment\nof its interest rate whenever a specified\n                      14                      \ninterest rate changes. Interest rates on these\nsecurities are ordinarily tied to, and are a\npercentage of, a widely recognized interest\nrate, such as the yield on 90-day US Treasury\nbills or the prime rate of a specified bank.\nThese rates may change as often as twice\ndaily. Generally, changes in interest rates\nwill have a smaller effect on the market value\nof variable and fixed rate floating rate\nsecurities than on the market value of\ncomparable fixed rate fixed income\nobligations. Thus, investing in variable and\nfixed rate floating rate securities generally\nallows less opportunity for capital\nappreciation and depreciation than investing\nin comparable fixed rate fixed income\nsecurities.\n\nVARIABLE RATE DEMAND OBLIGATIONS\n\nVariable rate demand obligations (\u201cVRDOs\u201d) are\nshort-term tax-exempt fixed income instruments\nwhose yield is reset on a periodic basis. VRDO\nsecurities tend to be issued with long\nmaturities of up to 30 or 40 years; however,\nthey are considered short-term instruments\nbecause they include a put feature which\ncoincides with the periodic yield reset. For\nexample, a VRDO whose yield resets weekly will\nhave a put feature that is exercisable upon\nseven days\u2019 notice. VRDOs are put back to a\nbank or other entity that serves as a\nliquidity provider, who then tries to resell\nthe VRDOs or, if unable to resell, holds them\nin its own inventory. VRDOs are generally\nsupported by either a Letter of Credit or a\nStand-by Bond Purchase Agreement to provide\ncredit enhancement.\n\nWHEN-ISSUED SECURITIES\n\nEach Fund may purchase securities on a when-\nissued basis. Delivery of and payment for\nthese securities may take place as long as a\nmonth or more after the date of the purchase\ncommitment. The value of these securities is\nsubject to market fluctuation during this\nperiod, and no income accrues to a Fund until\nsettlement takes place. When entering into a\nwhen-issued transaction, a Fund will rely on\nthe other party to consummate the transaction;\nif the other party fails to do so, a Fund may\nbe disadvantaged.\n\nSecurities purchased on a when-issued basis\nand held by a Fund are subject to changes in\nmarket value based upon actual or perceived\nchanges in the level of interest rates.\nGenerally, the value of such securities will\nfluctuate inversely to changes in interest\nrates \u2014 i.e., they will appreciate in value\nwhen interest rates decline and decrease in\nvalue when interest rates rise. Therefore, if\na Fund purchases securities on a \u201cwhen-issued\u201d\nbasis, there may be a greater possibility of\nfluctuation in a Fund\u2019s NAV.\n                                              \n       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS       \n                                              \nA discussion of the risks associated with an\ninvestment in each Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. The discussion below supplements,\nand should be read in conjunction with, the\nProspectus.\n\nGENERAL\n\nInvestment in a Fund should be made with an\nunderstanding that the value of a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities may fluctuate in\naccordance with changes in the financial\ncondition of the issuers of the portfolio\nsecurities, the value of securities generally\nand other factors.\n\nAn investment in a Fund should also be made\nwith an understanding of the risks inherent in\nan investment in securities, including the\nrisk that the financial condition of issuers\nmay become impaired or that the general\ncondition of the securities markets may\ndeteriorate (either of which may cause a\ndecrease in the value of the portfolio\nsecurities and thus in the value of Shares).\nSecurities are susceptible to general market\nfluctuations and to volatile increases and\ndecreases in value as market confidence in and\nperceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic and banking\ncrises. Securities of issuers traded on\nexchanges may be suspended on certain\nexchanges by the issuers themselves, by an\nexchange or by government authorities. The\nlikelihood of such suspensions may be higher\nfor securities of issuers in emerging or less-\ndeveloped market countries than in countries\nwith more developed markets. Trading\nsuspensions may be applied from time to time\nto the securities of individual issuers for\nreasons specific to that issuer, or may be\napplied broadly by exchanges or governmental\nauthorities in response to market events.\nSuspensions may last for significant periods\nof time, during which trading in the\nsecurities and instruments that reference the\nsecurities, such as participatory notes (or\n\u201cP-notes\u201d) or other derivative instruments,\nmay be halted.\n\nThe principal trading market for some of the\nsecurities in an Index may be in the over-the-\ncounter market. The existence of a liquid\ntrading market for certain securities may\ndepend on whether dealers will make a market\nin such securities. There can be no assurance\nthat a market will be made or maintained or\nthat any such market will be or remain liquid.\nThe price at which securities may be sold and\nthe value of a Fund\u2019s Shares will be adversely\naffected if trading markets for a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities are limited or absent or\nif bid/ask spreads are wide.\n                      15                      \nCHINA BOND RISK\n\nCertain Funds may invest in renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d)\ndenominated fixed income securities of Chinese\nissuers (\u201cChina bonds\u201d). To the extent a\nFund\u2019s underlying Index includes China bonds,\nthe Fund\u2019s ability to achieve its investment\nobjective is dependent on its continued access\nto such bonds. The Funds may invest in China\nbonds (i) through direct access to the China\nInterbank Bond Market (\u201cCIBM\u201d), (ii) through\ncertain foreign institutional investors that\nhave obtained a license from the Chinese\nregulators, and (iii) through Bond Connect, a\nprogram that provides foreign investors with\naccess to China\u2019s onshore bond market.\n\nCIBM Direct Access Program Risks. The CIBM is\nan OTC market established in 1997, and\naccounts for more than 95% of outstanding bond\nvalues of the total trading volume in the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (the \u201cPRC\u201d). On\nCIBM, domestic institutional investors and\ncertain foreign institutional investors can\ntrade, on a one-to-one quote-driven basis,\nsovereign bonds, government bonds, corporate\nbonds, bond repo, bond lending, bills issued\nby the People\u2019s Bank of China (\u201cPBOC\u201d) and\nother financial debt instruments. Pursuant to\nthe Announcement (2016) No. 3 issued by the\nPBOC on February 24, 2016, eligible foreign\ninstitutional investors can conduct trading on\nthe CIBM under a program established by the\nPBOC (\u201cCIBM Direct Access Program\u201d) subject to\nother rules and regulations as promulgated by\nthe PRC authorities. There is no trading quota\nlimitation.\n\nCIBM is regulated and supervised by the PBOC.\nThe PBOC is responsible for, among others,\npromulgating the applicable CIBM listing,\ntrading and operating rules, and supervising\nthe market operators of CIBM. Bonds and bond-\nrelated derivatives are traded in the CIBM\nprimarily through (i) independent bilateral\nnegotiation on a transaction by transaction\nbasis or (ii) through the \u201cclick-and-deal\u201d\ntrading model, whereby a party offers a quote\nin the market that can then be accepted by a\ncounterparty (thus, \u201cclicking\u201d the \u201cdeal\u201d). A\n\u201cclick-and-deal\u201d quote may also be\nautomatically matched with a price limit\norder. In addition, recently an \u201canonymous\nclick\u201d trading model has been implemented for\ncertain bonds and bond-related derivatives\nwhereby anonymous quotes offered in the market\nare automatically matched with counterparties\nbased on timing and price. Once a transaction\nis agreed upon, the parties will, in\naccordance with the terms of the transaction,\npromptly send instructions for the delivery of\nbonds and funds. Parties are required to have\nsufficient bonds and funds for delivery on the\nagreed upon delivery date. China Central\nDepository & Clearing Co., Ltd (\u201cCCDC\u201d) or\nShanghai Clearing House (\u201cSHCH\u201d) will deliver\nbonds according to the instructions sent by\nthe parties. Funds clearing banks will handle\nthe transfer and settlement of the payments of\nthe bonds on behalf of the parties. The China\nForeign Exchange Trading System is the unified\ntrading platform for CIBM.\n\nA Fund\u2019s investments in China bonds through\nthe CIBM Direct Access Program will be subject\nto a number of additional risks and\nrestrictions that may affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments and returns. Certain of these\nrisks are discussed below.\n\nThe CIBM Direct Access Program is relatively\nnew. Laws, rules, regulations, policies,\nnotices, circulars or guidelines relating to\nthe CIBM Direct Access Program as published or\napplied by the PBOC and other PRC authorities\nare relatively untested and are subject to\nchange from time to time. There can be no\nassurance that the CIBM Direct Access Program\nwill not be restricted, suspended or\nabolished. If such event occurs, a Fund\u2019s\nability to invest in the CIBM through the CIBM\nDirect Access Program will be adversely\naffected, and if the Fund is unable to\nadequately access the CIBM through other\nmeans, the Fund\u2019s ability to achieve its\ninvestment objective will be adversely\naffected.\n\nUnder the prevailing PRC regulations, eligible\nforeign institutional investors who wish to\ninvest directly in CIBM through the CIBM\nDirect Access Program may do so through an\nonshore settlement agent, who would be\nresponsible for making the relevant filings\nand account opening with the relevant\nauthorities. The Funds are therefore subject\nto the risk of default or errors on the part\nof such agent.\n\nRQFII Investment Risk. Investment companies,\nsuch as the Funds, are not currently within\nthe types of entities that are eligible for a\nRenminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional\nInvestor (\u201cRQFII\u201d) or Qualified Foreign\nInstitutional Investor (\u201cQFII\u201d) license.\nRather, each Fund may utilize the Adviser\u2019s\nRQFII license granted under RQFII regulations\nto invest in China bonds.\n\nIt is possible that the Adviser\u2019s RQFII status\ncould be suspended or revoked. Pursuant to PRC\nand RQFII regulations, the State\nAdministration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d)\nand the China Securities Regulatory Commission\n(\u201cCSRC\u201d) are vested with the power to impose\nregulatory sanctions if the Adviser, in its\ncapacity as RQFII, or the PRC custodian\nviolates any provision of the RQFII\nregulations. Any such violations could result\nin the revocation of the Adviser\u2019s RQFII\nlicense or other regulatory sanctions and may\nadversely affect the ability of a Fund to\ninvest in China bonds. The Adviser is also\nsubject to regulation by certain Hong Kong\nregulatory authorities, including the Hong\nKong Securities and Futures Commission.\nRegulatory matters arising from such\nregulation could also adversely affect the\nAdviser\u2019s RQFII license and ability to provide\nadvisory services, generally.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Adviser\nwill continue to maintain its RQFII status. In\nthe event the Adviser is unable to maintain\nits RQFII status, it may be necessary for the\nFund to limit or suspend creations of Creation\nUnits. In such event it is possible that the\ntrading price of the Fund\u2019s Shares on its\nExchange will be at a significant premium to\nthe NAV (which may also increase tracking\nerror of the Fund). In extreme circumstances,\na Fund may incur significant loss due to\nlimited investment capabilities, or may not be\nable fully to implement or pursue its\ninvestment objectives or strategies, due to\nRQFII investment restrictions, illiquidity of\nthe PRC securities markets, and delay or\ndisruption in execution of trades or in\nsettlement of trades.\n\nThe regulations which regulate investments by\nRQFIIs in the PRC and the repatriation of\ncapital from RQFII investments are relatively\nnew. The application and interpretation of\nsuch investment regulations are therefore\nrelatively untested and there is no certainty\nas to how they will be applied as the PRC\nauthorities and regulators have been given\nwide discretion in such investment regulations\nand there is no precedent or certainty as to\nhow such discretion may be exercised now or in\nthe future. Existing RQFII regulations may\nchange over time and new RQFII regulations may\nbe promulgated in the future and no assurance\ncan be given that any such changes will not\nadversely affect a Fund or its ability to\nachieve its investment objective.\n                      16                      \nBond Connect Risks. The \u201cMutual Bond Market\nAccess between Mainland China and Hong Kong\u201d\n(\u201cBond Connect\u201d) program is a new initiative\nestablished by PBOC, China Foreign Exchange\nTrade System & National Interbank Funding\nCentre (\u201cCFETS\u201d), CCDC, SHCH, and Hong Kong\nExchanges and Clearing Limited (\u201cHKEx\u201d) and\nCentral Moneymarkets Unit (\u201cCMU\u201d) of the Hong\nKong Monetary Authority (\u201cHKMA\u201d) to facilitate\ninvestor\u2019s investments between the Mainland\nChina and Hong Kong bond markets through\nconnection between the Mainland China and Hong\nKong financial institutions.\n\nUnder the prevailing PRC regulations, eligible\nforeign investors are allowed to invest in the\nbonds available on the CIBM through the\nnorthbound trading of Bond Connect\n(\u201cNorthbound Trading Link\u201d). There is\ncurrently no investment quota for the\nNorthbound Trading Link. The Northbound\nTrading Link refers to the trading platform\nthat is located outside of Mainland China and\nis connected to CFETS for eligible foreign\ninvestors to submit their trade requests for\nbonds circulated in the CIBM through Bond\nConnect. HKEx and CFETS work together with\noffshore electronic bond trading platforms to\nprovide electronic trading services and\nplatforms to allow direct trading between\neligible foreign investors and approved\nonshore dealers in Mainland China through\nCFETS. Under the Northbound Trading Link,\neligible foreign investors are required to\nappoint the CFETS or other institutions\nrecognized by the PBOC as registration agents\nto apply for registration with the PBOC.\n\nPursuant to the prevailing regulations in\nMainland China, the CMU, the offshore custody\nagent recognized by the HKMA, opens omnibus\nnominee accounts with the onshore custody\nagent recognized by the PBOC (i.e., the CCDC\nand SHCH). All bonds traded by eligible\nforeign investors will be registered in the\nname of the CMU, which will hold such bonds as\na nominee owner.\n\nBond Connect is relatively new. Laws, rules,\nregulations, policies, notices, circulars or\nguidelines relating to Bond Connect as\npublished or applied by any of the Bond\nConnect Authorities (as defined below) are\nrelatively untested and are subject to change.\n\u201cBond Connect Authorities\u201d refers to the\nexchanges, trading systems, settlement\nsystems, governmental, regulatory or tax\nbodies which provide services and/or regulate\nBond Connect and activities relating to Bond\nConnect, including, without limitation, the\nPBOC, the HKMA, the HKEx, the CFETS, the CMU,\nthe CCDC and the SHCH and any other regulator,\nagency or authority with jurisdiction,\nauthority or responsibility in respect of Bond\nConnect. There can be no assurance that Bond\nConnect will not be restricted, suspended or\nabolished. If such event occurs, a Fund\u2019s\nability to invest in the CIBM through Bond\nConnect may be adversely affected, and if the\nFund is unable to adequately access the CIBM\nthrough other means, the Fund\u2019s ability to\nachieve its investment objective may be\nadversely affected.\n\nUnder the prevailing Bond Connect regulations,\neligible foreign investors who wish to\nparticipate in Bond Connect may do so through\nan offshore custody agent, registration agent\nor other third parties (as the case may be),\nwho would be responsible for making the\nrelevant filings and account opening with the\nrelevant authorities. A Fund is therefore\nsubject to the risk of default or errors on\nthe part of such agents.\n\nTrading through Bond Connect is performed\nthrough newly developed trading platforms and\noperational systems. There is no assurance\nthat such systems will function properly (in\nparticular, under extreme market conditions)\nor will continue to be adapted to changes and\ndevelopments in the market. In the event that\nthe relevant systems fail to function\nproperly, trading through Bond Connect may be\ndisrupted. A Fund\u2019s ability to trade through\nBond Connect (and hence to pursue its\ninvestment strategy) may therefore be\nadversely affected. In addition, where a Fund\ninvests in the CIBM through Bond Connect, it\nmay be subject to risks of delays inherent in\nthe order placing and/or settlement.\n\nThe CMU is the \u201cnominee holder\u201d of the bonds\nacquired by a Fund through Bond Connect. While\nBond Connect Authorities have expressly stated\nthat investors will enjoy the rights and\ninterests of the bonds acquired through Bond\nConnect similar to investors in bond interests\nacquired through more traditional means in\naccordance with applicable laws, the exercise\nand the enforcement of beneficial ownership\nrights in such bonds in the Chinese courts has\nyet to be tested. As a result, for example,\nthough the HKMA has stated otherwise in its\nFrequently Asked Questions relating to Bond\nConnect, it is possible that in the event that\nthe nominee holder becomes insolvent, such\nbonds may be deemed to form part of the pool\nof assets of the nominee holder available for\ndistribution to its creditors thereby\nsubjugating the rights of a Fund.\n\nChinese Credit Rating Risks. China bonds will\ngenerally be rated by Chinese ratings agencies\n(and not by U.S. nationally recognized\nstatistical ratings organizations (\u201cNRSROs\u201d)).\nThe rating criteria and methodology used by\nChinese rating agencies may be different from\nthose adopted by NRSROs and international\ncredit rating agencies. Therefore, such rating\nsystems may not provide an equivalent standard\nfor comparison with securities rated by NRSROs\nand international credit rating agencies.\n                      17                      \nMarket Risks. A Fund investing in the CIBM\nwill be subject to liquidity and volatility\nrisks. Market volatility and potential lack of\nliquidity due to possible low trading volume\nof certain bonds in the CIBM may result in\nprices of certain bonds traded in the CIBM\n\nfluctuating significantly. The bid and offer\nspreads of the prices of such bonds may be\nlarge, and a Fund may therefore incur\nsignificant trading and realization costs and\nmay even suffer losses when selling such\ninvestments. To the extent that a Fund\ntransacts in the CIBM, the Fund may also be\nexposed to risks associated with settlement\nprocedures and default of counterparties. The\ncounterparty which has entered into a\ntransaction with a Fund may default in its\nobligation to settle the transaction by\nfailure to deliver relevant securities or to\nmake payment.\n                                              \n  GeneralPRC-RelatedRisks                     \n                                              \nEconomic, Political and Social Risks of the\nPRC. The economy of China, which has been in a\nstate of transition from a planned economy to\na more market-oriented economy, differs from\nthe economies of most developed countries in\nmany respects, including the level of\ngovernment involvement, its state of\ndevelopment, its growth rate, control of\nforeign exchange, protection of intellectual\nproperty rights and allocation of resources.\n\nAlthough the majority of productive assets in\nChina are still owned by the PRC government at\nvarious levels, in recent years, the PRC\ngovernment has implemented economic reform\nmeasures emphasizing utilization of market\nforces in the development of the economy of\nChina and a high level of management autonomy.\nThe economy of China has experienced\nsignificant growth in the past several\ndecades, but growth has been uneven both\ngeographically and among various sectors of\nthe economy, and no assurance can be given\nthat such growth will continue. Economic\ngrowth has also been accompanied by periods of\nhigh inflation. The PRC government has\nimplemented various measures from time to time\nto control inflation and restrain the rate of\neconomic growth.\n\nThere can, however, be no assurance that the\nPRC government will continue to pursue such\neconomic policies or, if it does, that those\npolicies will continue to be successful. Any\nsuch adjustment and modification of those\neconomic policies may have an adverse impact\non the securities markets in the PRC as well\nas the portfolio securities of a Fund.\nFurther, the PRC government may from time to\ntime adopt corrective measures to control the\ngrowth of the PRC economy, which may also have\nan adverse impact on the capital growth and\nperformance of a Fund. Political changes,\nsocial instability and adverse diplomatic\ndevelopments in the PRC could result in the\nimposition of additional government\nrestrictions, including expropriation of\nassets, confiscatory taxes, limits on\nrepatriation, or nationalization of some or\nall of the property held by the underlying\nissuers of a Fund\u2019s portfolio securities.\n\nPRC Laws and Regulations Risk. The regulatory\nand legal framework for capital markets and\ncompanies in the PRC may not be as well\ndeveloped as those of developed countries. PRC\nlaws and regulations affecting securities\nmarkets are relatively new and evolving, and\nbecause of the limited volume of published\ncases and judicial interpretation and their\nnon-binding nature, interpretation and\nenforcement of these regulations involve\nsignificant uncertainties. In addition, as the\nPRC legal system develops, no assurance can be\ngiven that changes in such laws and\nregulations or new laws, regulations or\npractices relating to transactions in Chinese\nsecurities will be promulgated, or that their\ninterpretation or enforcement will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities.\n\nIn addition, the effect of future developments\nin the PRC legal system is unpredictable, such\nas changes to the existing regulatory\nenvironment and government scrutiny in certain\nareas, uncertain interpretation and\nimplementation of existing laws or enforcement\nthereof, or the preemption of local\nregulations by national laws. For instance,\nChina has tightened regulatory requirements\nwith respect to privacy, data protection and\ninformation security, and has promulgated new\nregulations and policy to regulate certain\nindustries in the past year, which may in turn\nimpact the business operation of the\nunderlying issuers of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities. The rapid evolving legal system of\nChina may have a material adverse effect on a\nFund\u2019s portfolio securities.\n\nPRC Tax Risk. Uncertainties in PRC tax rules\ngoverning taxation of income and gains from\ninvestments in China bonds could result in\nunexpected tax liabilities for a Fund. A\nFund\u2019s investments in China bonds may cause\nthe Fund to become subject to withholding and\nother taxes imposed by the PRC. The Ministry\nof Finance of the PRC and the State\nAdministration of Taxation of the PRC issued\nCaishui No. 108 on November 7, 2018, which\nstates that bond interests derived from\ninvestment in the China bond market (including\nthrough CIBM, a RQFII/QFII license or Bond\nConnect) by foreign investors will be\ntemporarily exempt from withholding income tax\nand value added tax. The temporary exemption\nwill remain in effect until November 6, 2021.\nIf, in the future, China begins applying tax\nrules regarding the taxation of investment in\nChina bonds by foreign investors, and/or\nbegins collecting withholding and other taxes\non interest derived by such investment, a\nFund\u2019s return might be adversely affected.\n\nPolitical Tension Risk. Recently there have\nbeen heightened tensions in international\neconomic relations and rising political\ntensions. In particular, political tensions\nbetween the United States and China have\nescalated due to, among other things, trade\ndisputes, the COVID-19 outbreak, sanctions\nimposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury on\ncertain officials of the Hong Kong Special\nAdministrative Region and the PRC central\ngovernment, as well as retaliatory actions of\nthe PRC government. Rising political tensions\ncould reduce levels of trade, investments and\nother economic activities between the two\nmajor economies, and any escalation thereof\nmay have a negative impact on the general,\neconomic, political, and social conditions in\nChina and, in turn, adversely impact a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities.\n                      18                      \nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK\n\nAn investment in a Fund may be subject to a\nnumber of actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest. For example, the Adviser or its\naffiliates may provide services to a Fund,\nsuch as securities lending agency services,\ncustodial, administrative, bookkeeping, and\naccounting services, transfer agency and\nshareholder servicing, securities brokerage\nservices, and other services for which the\nFund would compensate the Adviser and/or such\naffiliates. A Fund may invest in other pooled\ninvestment vehicles sponsored, managed, or\notherwise affiliated with the Adviser. There\nis no assurance that the rates at which a Fund\npays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its\naffiliates, or the terms on which it enters\ninto transactions with the Adviser or its\naffiliates, will be the most favorable\navailable in the market generally or as\nfavorable as the rates the Adviser makes\navailable to other clients. Because of its\nfinancial interest, the Adviser may have an\nincentive to enter into transactions or\narrangements on behalf of a Fund with itself\nor its affiliates in circumstances where it\nmight not have done so in the absence of that\ninterest.\n\nCONTINUOUS OFFERING\n\nThe method by which Creation Units of Shares\nare created and traded may raise certain\nissues under applicable securities laws.\nBecause new Creation Units of Shares are\nissued and sold by the Trust on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201cdistribution,\u201d as such\nterm is used in the Securities Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner which could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery and liability\nprovisions of the Securities Act.\n\nFor example, a broker-dealer firm or its\nclient may be deemed a statutory underwriter\nif it takes Creation Units after placing an\norder with the Distributor, breaks them down\ninto constituent Shares, and sells such Shares\ndirectly to customers, or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of a supply of new Shares\nwith an active selling effort involving\nsolicitation of secondary market demand for\nShares. A determination of whether one is an\nunderwriter for purposes of the Securities Act\nmust take into account all the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the activities of\nthe broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case, and the examples mentioned\nabove should not be considered a complete\ndescription of all the activities that could\nlead to a categorization as an underwriter.\n\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u201cunderwriters\u201d but are\neffecting transactions in Shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nShares, are generally required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\nSecurities Act is not available in respect of\nsuch transactions as a result of Section 24(d)\nof the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a\nprospectus-delivery obligation with respect to\nShares of a Fund are reminded that under\nSecurities Act Rule 153, a prospectus-delivery\nobligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the\nSecurities Act owed to an exchange member in\nconnection with a sale on the Exchange is\nsatisfied by the fact that a Fund\u2019s Prospectus\nis available at the Exchange upon request. The\nprospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule\n153 is only available with respect to\ntransactions on an exchange.\n\nSSGA or its affiliates (the \u201cSelling\nShareholder\u201d) may purchase Creation Units\nthrough a broker-dealer to \u201cseed\u201d (in whole or\nin part) Funds as they are launched, or may\npurchase shares from broker-dealers or other\ninvestors that have previously provided \u201cseed\u201d\nfor Funds when they were launched or otherwise\nin secondary market transactions, and because\nthe Selling Shareholder may be deemed an\naffiliate of such Funds, the Fund Shares are\nbeing registered to permit the resale of these\nshares from time to time after purchase. The\nFunds will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese Fund Shares.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder intends to sell all or\na portion of the Fund Shares owned by it and\noffered hereby from time to time directly or\nthrough one or more broker-dealers, and may\nalso hedge such positions. The Fund Shares may\nbe sold on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the Fund Shares may be listed or quoted\nat the time of sale, in the over-the-counter\nmarket or in transactions other than on these\nexchanges or systems at fixed prices, at\nprevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected in transactions, which may\ninvolve cross or block transactions.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder may also loan or\npledge Fund Shares to broker-dealers that in\nturn may sell such Fund Shares, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law. The Selling\nShareholder may also enter into options or\nother transactions with broker-dealers or\nother financial institutions or the creation\nof one or more derivative securities which\nrequire the delivery to such broker-dealer or\nother financial institution of Fund Shares,\nwhich Fund Shares such broker-dealer or other\nfinancial institution may resell.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer\nor agents participating in the distribution of\nFund Shares may be deemed to be \u201cunderwriters\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(11) of the\nSecurities Act in connection with such sales.\nIn such event, any commissions paid to any\nsuch broker-dealer or agent and any profit on\nthe resale of the Fund Shares purchased by\nthem may be deemed to be underwriting\ncommissions or discounts under the Securities\nAct. The Selling Shareholder who may be deemed\nan \u201cunderwriter\u201d within the meaning of Section\n2(11) of the Securities Act will be subject to\nthe applicable prospectus delivery\nrequirements of the Securities Act.\n\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK\n\nCounterparty risk with respect to derivatives\nhas been and may continue to be affected by\nnew rules and regulations affecting the\nderivatives market. Some derivatives\ntransactions are required to be centrally\ncleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives\ntransaction is subject to the credit risk of\nthe clearing house and the clearing member\nthrough which it holds its cleared position,\nrather than the credit risk of its original\ncounterparty to the derivatives transaction.\nCredit risk of market participants with\nrespect to derivatives that are centrally\ncleared is concentrated in a few clearing\nhouses, and it is not clear how an insolvency\nproceeding of a clearing house would be\nconducted, what effect the insolvency\nproceeding would have on any recovery by a\nFund, and what impact an insolvency of a\nclearing house would have on the financial\nsystem more generally.\n                      19                      \nFUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS\n\nThere can be no assurance that a liquid\nsecondary market will exist for any particular\nfutures contract or option at any specific\ntime. Thus, it may not be possible to close a\nfutures or options position. In the event of\nadverse price movements, a Fund would continue\nto be required to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if a Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, a Fund may be required to make\ndelivery of the instruments underlying futures\ncontracts it has sold.\n\nEach Fund will minimize the risk that it will\nbe unable to close out a futures or options\ncontract by only entering into futures and\noptions for which there appears to be a liquid\nsecondary market.\n\nThe risk of loss in trading futures contracts\nor uncovered call options in some strategies\n(e.g., selling uncovered index futures\ncontracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds\ndo not plan to use futures and options\ncontracts, when available, in this manner. The\nrisk of a futures position may still be large\nas traditionally measured due to the low\nmargin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. A Fund, however, may utilize futures\nand options contracts in a manner designed to\nlimit its risk exposure to that which is\ncomparable to what it would have incurred\nthrough direct investment in securities.\n\nUtilization of futures transactions by a Fund\ninvolves the risk of imperfect or even\nnegative correlation to its benchmark Index if\nthe index underlying the futures contracts\ndiffers from the benchmark Index or if the\nfutures contracts do not track the benchmark\nIndex as expected. There is also the risk of\nloss by a Fund of margin deposits in the event\nof bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has\nan open position in the futures contract or\noption.\n\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract prices during a single trading day.\nThe daily limit establishes the maximum amount\nthat the price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. The daily limit governs only price\nmovement during a particular trading day and\ntherefore does not limit potential losses,\nbecause the limit may prevent the liquidation\nof unfavorable positions. Futures contract\nprices have occasionally moved to the daily\nlimit for several consecutive trading days\nwith little or no trading, thereby preventing\nprompt liquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting some futures traders to substantial\nlosses.\n\nRISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS\n\nSwap agreements are subject to the risk that\nthe swap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, a Fund\nwill have contractual remedies pursuant to the\nagreements related to the transaction, but\nsuch remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and\ninsolvency laws which could affect the Fund\u2019s\nrights as a creditor.\n\nThe use of interest-rate and index swaps is a\nhighly specialized activity that involves\ninvestment techniques and risks different from\nthose associated with ordinary portfolio\nsecurity transactions. The use of a swap\nrequires an understanding not only of the\nreferenced asset, reference rate or index but\nalso of the swap itself, without the benefit\nof observing the performance of the swap under\nall possible market conditions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the\ndelivery of securities or other underlying\nassets or principal.\n\nThe absence of a regulated execution facility\nor contract market and lack of liquidity for\nswap transactions has led, in some instances,\nto difficulties in trading and valuation,\nespecially in the event of market disruptions.\nUnder recently adopted rules and regulations,\ntransactions in some types of swaps are\nrequired to be centrally cleared. In a cleared\nderivatives transaction, a Fund\u2019s counterparty\nto the transaction is a central derivatives\nclearing organization, or clearing house,\nrather than a bank or broker. Because each\nFund is not a member of a clearing house, and\nonly members of a clearing house can\nparticipate directly in the clearing house,\nthe Fund holds cleared derivatives through\naccounts at clearing members. In cleared\nderivatives transactions, a Fund will make\npayments (including margin payments) to and\nreceive payments from a clearing house through\nits accounts at clearing members. Clearing\nmembers guarantee performance of their\nclients\u2019 obligations to the clearing house.\nCentrally cleared derivative arrangements may\nbe less favorable to a Fund than bilateral\n(non-cleared) arrangements. For example, a\nFund may be required to provide greater\namounts of margin for cleared derivatives\ntransactions than for bilateral derivatives\ntransactions. Also, in contrast to bilateral\nderivatives transactions, in some cases\nfollowing a period of notice to a Fund, a\nclearing member generally can require\ntermination of existing cleared derivatives\ntransactions at any time or an increase in\nmargin requirements above the margin that the\nclearing member required at the beginning of a\ntransaction. Clearing houses also have broad\nrights to increase margin requirements for\nexisting transactions or to terminate\ntransactions at any time. A Fund is subject to\nrisk if it enters into a derivatives\ntransaction that is required to be cleared (or\nwhich SSGA FM expects to be cleared), and no\nclearing member is willing or able to clear\nthe transaction on the Fund\u2019s behalf. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the benefit of the transaction,\nincluding loss of an increase in the value of\nthe transaction and loss of hedging\nprotection. In addition, the documentation\ngoverning the relationship between a Fund and\nclearing members is drafted by the clearing\nmembers and generally is less favorable to the\nFund than typical bilateral derivatives\ndocumentation.\n                      20                      \nThese clearing rules and other new rules and\nregulations could, among other things,\nrestrict a Fund\u2019s ability to engage in, or\nincrease the cost to the Fund of, derivatives\ntransactions, for example, by making some\ntypes of derivatives no longer available to\nthe Fund, increasing margin or capital\nrequirements, or otherwise limiting liquidity\nor increasing transaction costs. These\nregulations are new and evolving, so their\npotential impact on a Fund and the financial\nsystem are not yet known.\n\nBecause they are two party contracts that may\nbe subject to contractual restrictions on\ntransferability and termination and because\nthey may have terms of greater than seven\ndays, swap agreements may be considered to be\nilliquid and subject to a Fund\u2019s limitation on\ninvestments in illiquid investments. To the\nextent that a swap is not liquid, it may not\nbe possible to initiate a transaction or\nliquidate a position at an advantageous time\nor price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Like most other investments, swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nmarket value of the instrument will change in\na way detrimental to a Fund\u2019s interest.\n\nIf a Fund uses a swap as a hedge against, or\nas a substitute for, a portfolio investment,\nthe Fund will be exposed to the risk that the\nswap will have or will develop imperfect or no\ncorrelation with the portfolio investment.\nThis could cause substantial losses for the\nFund. While hedging strategies involving swap\ninstruments can reduce the risk of loss, they\ncan also reduce the opportunity for gain or\neven result in losses by offsetting favorable\nprice movements in other Fund investments.\nMany swaps are complex and often valued\nsubjectively.\n\nEUROPE \u2013 RECENT EVENTS\n\nA number of countries in Europe, including\nGreece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal,\nhave experienced rising government debt\nlevels. The concern over these debt levels has\nled to volatility in the European financial\nmarkets, which has adversely affected the\nexchange rate of the euro and may continue to\nsignificantly affect every country in Europe.\nFor some countries, the ability to repay\nsovereign debt is in question, and default is\npossible, which could affect their ability to\nborrow in the future. Several countries have\nagreed to multi-year bailout loans from the\nEuropean Central Bank, the IMF, and other\ninstitutions. A default or debt restructuring\nby any European country can adversely impact\nholders of that country\u2019s debt and can affect\nexposures to other EU countries and their\nfinancial companies as well. These financial\ndifficulties may continue, worsen or spread\nwithin or outside Europe. Responses to the\nfinancial problems by European governments,\ncentral banks and others, including austerity\nmeasures and reforms, may not work, may result\nin social unrest and may limit future growth\nand economic recovery or have other unintended\nconsequences.\n\nUncertainties regarding the viability of the\nEU have impacted and may continue to impact\nmarkets in the United States and around the\nworld. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom\nformally withdrew from the EU (commonly\nreferred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and entered an\n11-month transition period. The transition\nperiod concluded on December 31, 2020, and the\nUnited Kingdom left the EU single market and\ncustoms union under the terms of a new trade\nagreement. The agreement governs the new\nrelationship between the United Kingdom and EU\nwith respect to trading goods and services,\nbut critical aspects of the relationship\nremain unresolved and subject to further\nnegotiation and agreement. The full scope and\nnature of the consequences of the exit are not\nat this time known and are unlikely to be\nknown for a significant period of time. It is\nalso unknown whether the United Kingdom\u2019s exit\nwill increase the likelihood of other\ncountries also departing the EU. Any\nadditional exits from the EU, or the\npossibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments.\n\nLIBOR RISK\n\nInstruments or contracts in which the Funds\ninvest may pay interest at floating or\nadjusting rates based on LIBOR or may be\nsubject to interest caps or floors tied to\nLIBOR. LIBOR is used extensively in the U.S.\nand globally as a benchmark or reference rate\nfor various commercial and financial\ncontracts, including corporate and municipal\nbonds, bank loans, asset-backed and mortgage-\nrelated securities, interest rate swaps and\nother derivatives.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s\nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA), which\nregulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021, it\nwould cease its active encouragement of banks\nto provide quotations needed to sustain the\nLIBOR rate. On March 5, 2021, the\nadministrator of LIBOR announced a delay in\nthe phase out of the majority of the USD LIBOR\npublications until June 30, 2023, with the\nremainder of LIBOR publications having ceased\non December 31, 2021. The U.S. Federal\nReserve, in conjunction with the Alternative\nReference Rates Committee, a steering\ncommittee comprised of large U.S. financial\ninstitutions, has identified the Secured\nOvernight Financial Rate (SOFR) as the\npreferred alternative rate to LIBOR. SOFR is a\nrelatively new index calculated by short-term\nrepurchase agreements, backed by Treasury\nsecurities.\n                      21                      \nWhile some instruments or contracts may\ncontemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no\nlonger available by providing for an\nalternative rate setting methodology, not all\ninstruments or contracts may have such\n\u201cfallback provisions.\u201d Abandonment of or\nmodifications to LIBOR could lead to\nsignificant short-term and long-term\nuncertainty and market instability and the\nextent to which that may impact a Fund may\nvary depending on various factors, which\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) existing\nfallback or termination provisions in\nindividual contracts and (ii) whether, how,\nand when industry participants develop and\nadopt new successor reference rates and/or\nfallbacks for both legacy and new instruments\nor contracts. To address the potential risks\nand uncertainty associated with instruments or\ncontracts containing no fallback provisions,\nin March 2022, the Biden administration\nenacted legislation that provides a uniform\nnational approach for replacing USD LIBOR. In\ninstances where a contract or instrument does\nnot contain an effective fallback provision,\nthe USD LIBOR rate will be replaced by a rate\nbased on SOFR that is selected by the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe transition to a successor rate may result\nin (i) increased volatility or illiquidity in\nmarkets for instruments or contracts that\ncurrently rely on LIBOR, (ii) a reduction in\nthe value of certain instruments or contracts\nheld by a Fund, (iii) reduced effectiveness of\nrelated Fund transactions, such as hedging,\n(iv) additional tax, accounting and regulatory\nrisks, or (v) costs incurred in connection\nwith closing out positions and entering into\nnew trades. Any pricing adjustments to a\nFund\u2019s investments resulting from a substitute\nreference rate may also adversely affect a\nFund\u2019s performance and/or NAV. Additionally,\nif LIBOR ultimately ceases to exist, a Fund\nmay need to renegotiate the credit agreements\nextending beyond the LIBOR phase out date with\na Fund\u2019s obligors that utilize LIBOR as a\nfactor in determining the interest rate and\ncertain of a Fund\u2019s existing credit facilities\nto replace LIBOR a new rate. Any pricing\nadjustments to a Fund\u2019s investments resulting\nfrom a substitute reference rate may also\nadversely affect a Fund\u2019s performance and/or\nNAV. There is no assurance that the\ncomposition or characteristics of any such\nalternative reference rate will be similar to\nor produce the same value or economic\nequivalence as LIBOR or that instruments or\ncontracts using an alternative rate will have\nthe same volume or liquidity.\n\nMARKET TURBULENCE RESULTING FROM COVID-19\n\nAn outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by\na novel coronavirus first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has spread globally. In an\norganized attempt to contain and mitigate the\neffects of the spread of the coronavirus known\nas COVID-19, governments and businesses world-\nwide have taken aggressive measures, including\nclosing borders, restricting international and\ndomestic travel, and the imposition of\nprolonged quarantines of large populations.\nCOVID-19 has resulted in the disruption of and\ndelays in the delivery of healthcare services\nand processes, the cancellation of organized\nevents and educational institutions, the\ndisruption of production and supply chains, a\ndecline in consumer demand for certain goods\nand services, and general concern and\nuncertainty, all of which have contributed to\nincreased volatility in global markets. The\neffects of COVID-19 will likely affect certain\nsectors and industries more dramatically than\nothers, which may adversely affect the value\nof a Fund\u2019s investments in those sectors or\nindustries. COVID-19, and other epidemics and\npandemics that may arise in the future, could\nadversely affect the economies of many\nnations, the global economy, individual\ncompanies and capital markets in ways that\ncannot be foreseen at the present time. In\naddition, the impact of infectious diseases in\ndeveloping or emerging market countries may be\ngreater due to limited health care resources.\nPolitical, economic and social stresses caused\nby COVID-19 also may exacerbate other pre-\nexisting political, social and economic risks\nin certain countries. The duration of COVID-19\nand its effects cannot be determined at this\ntime, but the effects could be present for an\nextended period of time.\n\nRUSSIA SANCTIONS RISK\n\nSanctions threatened or imposed by a number of\njurisdictions, including the United States,\nthe European Union and the United Kingdom, and\nother intergovernmental actions that have been\nor may be undertaken in the future, against\nRussia, Russian entities or Russian\nindividuals, may result in the devaluation of\nRussian currency, a downgrade in the country\u2019s\ncredit rating, an immediate freeze of Russian\nassets, a decline in the value and liquidity\nof Russian securities, property or interests,\nand/or other adverse consequences to the\nRussian economy or a Fund. The scope and scale\nof sanctions in place at a particular time may\nbe expanded or otherwise modified in a way\nthat have negative effects on a Fund.\nSanctions, or the threat of new or modified\nsanctions, could impair the ability of a Fund\nto buy, sell, hold, receive, deliver or\notherwise transact in certain affected\nsecurities or other investment instruments.\nSanctions could also result in Russia taking\ncounter measures or other actions in response,\nwhich may further impair the value and\nliquidity of Russian securities. These\nsanctions, and the resulting disruption of the\nRussian economy, may cause volatility in other\nregional and global markets and may negatively\nimpact the performance of various sectors and\nindustries, as well as companies in other\ncountries, which could have a negative effect\non the performance of a Fund, even if a Fund\ndoes not have direct exposure to securities of\nRussian issuers. As a collective result of the\nimposition of sanctions, Russian government\ncountermeasures and the impact that they have\nhad on the trading markets for Russian\nsecurities, certain Funds have used, and may\nin the future use, fair valuation procedures\napproved by the Fund\u2019s Board to value certain\nRussian securities, which could result in such\nsecurities being deemed to have a zero value.\n\nA reduction in liquidity of certain Fund\nholdings as a result of sanctions and related\nactions may cause a Fund to experience\nincreased\n\npremiums or discounts to its NAV and/or wider\nbid-ask spreads. Additionally, if it becomes\nimpracticable or unlawful for a Fund to hold\nsecurities subject to, or otherwise affected\nby, sanctions, or if deemed appropriate by the\nFund\u2019s investment adviser, the Fund may\nprohibit in-kind deposits of the affected\nsecurities in connection with creation\ntransactions and instead require a cash\ndeposit, which may also increase the Fund\u2019s\ntransaction costs.\n                      22                      \nTAX RISKS\n\nAs with any investment, you should consider\nhow your investment in Shares of a Fund will\nbe taxed. The tax information in the\nProspectus and this SAI is provided as general\ninformation. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in Shares of a Fund.\n\nUnless your investment in Shares is made\nthrough a tax-exempt entity or tax-advantaged\nretirement account, such as an individual\nretirement account, you need to be aware of\nthe possible tax consequences when a Fund\nmakes distributions or you sell Shares.\n                                              \n           INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS            \n                                              \nThe Trust has adopted the following investment\nrestrictions as fundamental policies with\nrespect to each Fund. These restrictions\ncannot be changed without the approval of the\nholders of a majority of a Fund\u2019s outstanding\nvoting securities. For purposes of the 1940\nAct, a majority of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of a Fund means the vote, at an\nannual or a special meeting of the security\nholders of the Trust, of the lesser of (1) 67%\nor more of the voting securities of the Fund\npresent at such meeting, if the holders of\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund are present or\nrepresented by proxy, or (2) more than 50% of\nthe outstanding voting securities of the Fund.\nExcept with the approval of a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities, each Fund may\nnot:\n                                              \n      Concentrate its investments in          \n      securities of issuers in the same       \n  1.  industry, except as may be necessary    \n      to approximate the composition of the   \n      Fund\u2019s underlying Index;1               \n                                              \n                                              \n      Make loans to another person except as  \n      permitted by the 1940 Act or other      \n  2.  governing statute, by the Rules         \n      thereunder, or by the SEC or other      \n      regulatory agency with authority over   \n      the Fund;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      Issue senior securities or borrow       \n      money except as permitted by the 1940   \n  3.  Act or other governing statute, by the  \n      Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or      \n      other regulatory agency with authority  \n      over the Fund;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Invest directly in real estate unless   \n      the real estate is acquired as a        \n      result of ownership of securities or    \n  4.  other instruments.

If a percentage\nlimitation is adhered to at the time of\ninvestment or contract, a later increase or\ndecrease in percentage resulting from any\nchange in value or total or net assets will\nnot result in a violation of such restriction,\nexcept that the percentage limitations with\nrespect to the borrowing of money will be\nobserved continuously. With respect to the\nlimitation on borrowing, in the event that a\nsubsequent change in net assets or other\ncircumstances cause a Fund to exceed its\nlimitation, the Fund will take steps to bring\nthe aggregate amount of borrowing back within\nthe limitations within three days thereafter\n(not including Sundays and holidays).\n                      23                      \nThe 1940 Act currently permits each Fund to\nloan up to 33 1/3% of its total assets. With\nrespect to borrowing, the 1940 Act presently\nallows each Fund to: (1) borrow from any bank\n(including pledging, mortgaging or\nhypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33\n1/3% of its total assets, (2) borrow money for\ntemporary purposes in an amount not exceeding\n5% of the value of the Fund\u2019s total assets at\nthe time of the loan, and (3) enter into\nreverse repurchase agreements. However, under\nnormal circumstances any borrowings by a Fund\nwill not exceed 10% of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets. The 1940 Act generally prohibits funds\nfrom issuing senior securities, although it\ndoes not treat certain transactions as senior\nsecurities, such as certain borrowings, short\nsales, reverse repurchase agreements, firm\ncommitment agreements and standby commitments,\nwith appropriate earmarking or segregation of\nassets to cover such obligation. With respect\nto investments in commodities, the 1940 Act\npresently permits the Funds to invest in\ncommodities in accordance with investment\npolicies contained in its prospectus and SAI.\nAny such investment shall also comply with the\nCEA and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe 1940 Act does not directly restrict an\ninvestment company\u2019s ability to invest in real\nestate, but does\n                                              \n     The SEC Staff considers concentration    \n     to involve more than 25% of a fund\u2019s     \n     assets to be invested in an industry or  \n     group of industries. require that every  \n     investment company have the fundamental  \n  1  investment policy governing such         \n     investments. The Funds will not          \n     purchase or sell real estate, except     \n     that a Fund may invest in companies      \n     that deal in real estate (including      \n     REITs) or in instruments that are        \n     backed or secured by real estate.        \n                                              \n                                              \n         EXCHANGE LISTING AND TRADING         \n                                              \nA discussion of exchange listing and trading\nmatters associated with an investment in a\nFund is contained in the Prospectus under\n\u201cPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION\u201d and\n\u201cADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION.\u201d\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, such sections of\nthe Prospectus.\n\nThe Shares of each Fund are approved for\nlisting and trading on the Exchange, subject\nto notice of issuance. Shares trade on the\nExchange at prices that may differ to some\ndegree from their net asset value. There can\nbe no assurance that the requirements of the\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nShares of a Fund will continue to be met.\n\nThe Exchange may consider the suspension of\ntrading in, and may initiate delisting\nproceedings of, the Shares of a Fund under any\nof the following circumstances: (i) if the\nExchange becomes aware that the Fund is no\nlonger eligible to operate in reliance on Rule\n6c-11 under the 1940 Act; (ii) if the Fund no\nlonger complies with the applicable listing\nrequirements set forth in the Exchange\u2019s\nrules; (iii) if, following the initial twelve-\nmonth period after commencement of trading on\nthe Exchange of the Fund, there are fewer than\n50 beneficial holders of the Fund; or (iv) if\nsuch other event shall occur or condition\nexists which, in the opinion of the Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Exchange\ninadvisable. The Exchange will remove the\nShares from listing and trading upon\ntermination of a Fund.\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nShare price of a Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor\u2019s\nequity interest in the Fund.\n\nAs in the case of other publicly traded\nsecurities, brokers\u2019 commissions on\ntransactions will be based on negotiated\ncommission rates at customary levels.\n\nThe base and trading currencies of each Fund\nis the U.S. dollar. The base currency is the\ncurrency in which a Fund\u2019s net asset value per\nShare is calculated and the trading currency\nis the currency in which Shares of a Fund are\nlisted and traded on the Exchange.\n                                              \n           MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST            \n                                              \nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled \u201cMANAGEMENT.\u201d\n\nBoard Responsibilities.The management and\naffairs of the Trust and its series, including\nthe Funds described in this SAI, are overseen\nby the Trustees. The Board has approved\ncontracts, as described in this SAI, under\nwhich certain companies provide essential\nmanagement services to the Trust.\n\nLike most mutual funds, the day-to-day\nbusiness of the Trust, including the\nmanagement of risk, is performed by third\nparty service providers, such as the Adviser,\nSub-Adviser, Distributor, Administrator, and\nSub-Administrator. The Trustees are\nresponsible for overseeing the Trust\u2019s service\nproviders and, thus, have oversight\nresponsibility with respect to risk management\nperformed by those service providers. Risk\nmanagement seeks to identify and address\nrisks, i.e., events or circumstances that\ncould have material adverse effects on the\nbusiness, operations, shareholder services,\ninvestment performance or reputation of the\nFunds. The Funds and their service providers\nemploy a variety of processes, procedures and\ncontrols to identify various of those possible\nevents or circumstances, to lessen the\nprobability of their occurrence and/or to\nmitigate the effects of such events or\ncircumstances if they do occur. Each service\nprovider is responsible for one or more\ndiscrete aspects of the Trust\u2019s business\n(e.g., a Sub-Adviser is responsible for the\nday-to-day management of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\ninvestments) and, consequently, for managing\nthe risks associated with that business. The\nBoard has emphasized to the Funds\u2019 service\nproviders the importance of maintaining\nvigorous risk management.\n                      24                      \nThe Trustees\u2019 role in risk oversight begins\nbefore the inception of a Fund, at which time\nthe Fund\u2019s Adviser and, if applicable, Sub-\nAdviser presents the Board with information\nconcerning the investment objectives,\nstrategies and risks of the Fund, as well as\nproposed investment limitations for the Fund.\nAdditionally, the Fund\u2019s Adviser and Sub-\nAdviser provide the Board with an overview of,\namong other things, their investment\nphilosophies, brokerage practices and\ncompliance infrastructures. Thereafter, the\nBoard continues its oversight function as\nvarious personnel, including the Trust\u2019s Chief\nCompliance Officer, as well as personnel of\nthe Adviser and other service providers, such\nas the Fund\u2019s independent accountants, make\nperiodic reports to the Audit Committee or to\nthe Board with respect to various aspects of\nrisk management. The Board and the Audit\nCommittee oversee efforts by management and\nservice providers to manage risks to which a\nFund may be exposed.\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing the\nnature, extent and quality of the services\nprovided to the Funds by the Adviser and Sub-\nAdviser and receives information about those\nservices at its regular meetings. In addition,\non an annual basis, in connection with its\nconsideration of whether to renew the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement and Sub-Advisory\nAgreement with the Adviser and Sub-Adviser,\nrespectively, the Board meets with the Adviser\nand Sub-Adviser to review such services. Among\nother things, the Board regularly considers\nthe Adviser\u2019s and Sub-Adviser\u2019s adherence to\nthe Fund\u2019s investment restrictions and\ncompliance with various Fund policies and\nprocedures and with applicable securities\nregulations. The Board also reviews\ninformation about each Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nThe Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer reports\nregularly to the Board to review and discuss\ncompliance issues. At least annually, the\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer provides the\nBoard with a report reviewing the adequacy and\neffectiveness of the Trust\u2019s policies and\nprocedures and those of its service providers,\nincluding the Adviser and any Sub-Adviser. The\nreport addresses the operation of the policies\nand procedures of the Trust and each service\nprovider since the date of the last report;\nany material changes to the policies and\nprocedures since the date of the last report;\nany recommendations for material changes to\nthe policies and procedures; and any material\ncompliance matters since the date of the last\nreport.\n\nThe Board receives reports from the Funds\u2019\nservice providers regarding operational risks\nand risks related to the valuation and\nliquidity of portfolio securities. Regular\nreports are made to the Board concerning\ninvestments for which market quotations are\nnot readily available. Annually, the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nreviews with the Audit Committee its audit of\neach Fund\u2019s financial statements, focusing on\nmajor areas of risk encountered by the Funds\nand noting any significant deficiencies or\nmaterial weaknesses in the Fund\u2019s internal\ncontrols. Additionally, in connection with its\noversight function, the Board oversees Fund\nmanagement\u2019s implementation of disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, which are designed to\nensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports\nwith the SEC are recorded, processed,\nsummarized, and reported within the required\ntime periods. The Board also oversees the\nTrust\u2019s internal controls over financial\nreporting, which comprise policies and\nprocedures designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of the\nTrust\u2019s financial reporting and the\npreparation of the Trust\u2019s financial\nstatements.\n\nFrom their review of these reports and\ndiscussions with the Adviser and Sub-Adviser,\nthe Chief Compliance Officer, the independent\nregistered public accounting firm and other\nservice providers, the Board and the Audit\nCommittee learn in detail about the material\nrisks of the Funds, thereby facilitating a\ndialogue about how management and service\nproviders identify and mitigate those risks.\n\nThe Board recognizes that not all risks that\nmay affect a Fund can be identified and/or\nquantified, that it may not be practical or\ncost-effective to eliminate or mitigate\ncertain risks, that it may be necessary to\nbear certain risks (such as investment-related\nrisks) to achieve a Fund\u2019s goals, and that the\nprocesses, procedures and controls employed to\naddress certain risks may be limited in their\neffectiveness. Moreover, reports received by\nthe Trustees as to risk management matters are\ntypically summaries of the relevant\ninformation. Most of the Funds\u2019 investment\nmanagement and business affairs are carried\nout by or through a Fund\u2019s Adviser, Sub-\nAdviser and other service providers, each of\nwhich has an independent interest in risk\nmanagement but whose policies and the methods\nby which one or more risk management functions\nare carried out may differ from the Funds\u2019 and\neach other\u2019s in the setting of priorities, the\nresources available or the effectiveness of\nrelevant controls. As a result of the\nforegoing and other factors, the Board\u2019s\nability to monitor and manage risk, as a\npractical matter, is subject to limitations.\n\nTrustees and Officers.There are five members\nof the Board of Trustees, four of whom are not\ninterested persons of the Trust, as that term\nis defined in the 1940 Act (\u201cIndependent\nTrustees\u201d). Carl Verboncoeur, an Independent\nTrustee, serves as Chairman of the Board. The\nBoard has determined its leadership structure\nis appropriate given the specific\ncharacteristics and circumstances of the\nTrust. The Board made this determination in\nconsideration of, among other things, the fact\nthat the Independent Trustees constitute a\nsuper-majority (greater than 75%) of the\nBoard, the fact that the chairperson of each\nCommittee of the Board is an Independent\nTrustee, the amount of assets under management\nin the Trust, and the number of funds overseen\nby the Board. The Board also believes that its\nleadership structure facilitates the orderly\nand efficient flow of information to the\nIndependent Trustees from fund management.\n\nThe Board of Trustees has two standing\ncommittees: the Audit Committee and Trustee\nCommittee. The Audit Committee and Trustee\nCommittee are each chaired by an Independent\nTrustee and composed of all of the Independent\nTrustees.\n                      25                      \nSet forth below are the names, year of birth,\nposition with the Trust, length of term of\noffice, and the principal occupations during\nthe last five years and other directorships\nheld of each of the persons currently serving\nas a Trustee or Officer of the Trust.\n\nTRUSTEES\n                                              \n                                 NU\u2026    OTH\u2026  \n                 TERM             OF    DIR\u2026  \n  NA\u2026            OF      PRI\u2026    PO\u2026    HELD  \n  AD\u2026    POS\u2026    OFF\u2026    OCC\u2026     IN    BY    \n  AND    WITH    AND     DUR\u2026    FU\u2026    TRU\u2026  \n  YE\u2026    FUN\u2026    LEN\u2026    PAST    CO\u2026    DUR\u2026  \n  OF\u00a0            OF      5       OV\u2026    THE   \n  BI\u2026            TIME    YEA\u2026     BY    PAST  \n                 SER\u2026            TR\u2026    5\u00a0    \n                                        YEA\u2026  \n  IN\u2026                                         \n  TR\u2026                                         \n  CA\u2026                                         \n  G.                                          \n  VE\u2026                                         \n  c/o                                         \n  SP\u2026    Ind\u2026    Ter\u2026                   The   \n  Se\u2026    Tru\u2026    Unl\u2026    Sel\u2026           Mot\u2026  \n  Tr\u2026    Cha\u2026    Ser\u2026    con\u2026    124    Fool  \n  One    Tru\u2026    sin\u2026    sin\u2026           Fun\u2026  \n  Ir\u2026    Com\u2026    Apr\u2026    200\u2026           Tru\u2026  \n  St\u2026    Cha\u2026    2010                   (Tr\u2026  \n  Bo\u2026                                         \n  MA                                          \n  02\u2026                                         \n  19\u2026                                         \n  DW\u2026                    Sel\u2026                 \n  D.                     con\u2026                 \n  CH\u2026                    sin\u2026           Aff\u2026  \n  c/o                    201\u2026           Man\u2026  \n  SP\u2026    Ind\u2026    Ter\u2026    CEO            Gro\u2026  \n  Se\u2026    Tru\u2026    Unl\u2026    and            Inc.  \n  Tr\u2026    Aud\u2026    Ser\u2026    Pre\u2026    124    (Ch\u2026  \n  One    Com\u2026    sin\u2026    CFA            Dir\u2026  \n  Ir\u2026    Cha\u2026    Apr\u2026    Ins\u2026           and   \n  St\u2026            2010    (Ju\u2026           Aud\u2026  \n  Bo\u2026                    2014           Com\u2026  \n  MA                     -              Cha\u2026  \n  02\u2026                    Jan\u2026                 \n  19\u2026                    201\u2026                 \n                                              \n                      26                      \n                                              \n                                 NU\u2026    OTH\u2026  \n                 TERM             OF    DIR\u2026  \n  NA\u2026            OF      PRI\u2026    PO\u2026    HELD  \n  AD\u2026    POS\u2026    OFF\u2026    OCC\u2026     IN    BY    \n  AND    WITH    AND     DUR\u2026    FU\u2026    TRU\u2026  \n  YE\u2026    FUN\u2026    LEN\u2026    PAST    CO\u2026    DUR\u2026  \n  OF\u00a0            OF      5       OV\u2026    THE   \n  BI\u2026            TIME    YEA\u2026     BY    PAST  \n                 SER\u2026            TR\u2026    5\u00a0    \n                                        YEA\u2026  \n                                        Pri\u2026  \n                                        Fin\u2026  \n                                        Gro\u2026  \n                                        (Di\u2026  \n                                        Bain  \n                                        Cap\u2026  \n                                        Spe\u2026  \n                                        Fin\u2026  \n                                        (Di\u2026  \n                                        Put\u2026  \n                                        Acq\u2026  \n  CL\u2026                                   Fin\u2026  \n  S.

As such, the Board has delegated the\nresponsibility to vote such proxies to the\nAdviser for all Funds other than the SPDR\nBloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF and\nSPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond\nETF, for which it has delegated responsibility\nto their sub-adviser, State Street Global\nAdvisors Limited (\u201cSSGA LTD\u201d). Each of the\nTrust\u2019s and the Adviser\u2019s proxy voting policy\nis attached at the end of this SAI. SSGA LTD\u2019s\nproxy voting policy is substantially and\nmaterially the same as the Adviser\u2019s proxy\nvoting policy.

For example, an account may sell a\nsignificant position in a security, which\ncould cause the market price of that security\nto decrease, while a Fund maintained its\nposition in that security.\n\nA potential conflict may arise when the\nportfolio managers are responsible for\naccounts that have different advisory fees\u2014the\ndifference in fees could create an incentive\nfor the portfolio manager to favor one account\nover another, for example, in terms of access\nto investment opportunities. Another potential\nconflict may arise when the portfolio manager\nhas an investment in one or more accounts that\nparticipate in transactions with other\naccounts. His or her investment(s) may create\nan incentive for the portfolio manager to\nfavor one account over another. The Adviser\nhas adopted policies and procedures reasonably\ndesigned to address these potential material\nconflicts. For instance, portfolio managers\nare normally responsible for all accounts\nwithin a certain investment discipline, and do\nnot, absent special circumstances,\ndifferentiate among the various accounts when\nallocating resources. Additionally, the\nAdviser and its advisory affiliates have\nprocesses and procedures for allocating\ninvestment opportunities among portfolios that\nare designed to provide a fair and equitable\nallocation.\n\nSSGA\u2019s culture is complemented and reinforced\nby a total rewards strategy that is based on a\npay for performance philosophy which seeks to\noffer a competitive pay mix of base salary,\nbenefits, cash incentives and deferred\ncompensation.\n\nSalary is based on a number of factors,\nincluding external benchmarking data and\nmarket trends, State Street performance, SSGA\nperformance, and individual overall\nperformance. SSGA\u2019s Global Human Resources\ndepartment regularly participates in\ncompensation surveys in order to provide SSGA\nwith market-based compensation information\nthat helps support individual pay decisions.\n\nAdditionally, subject to State Street and SSGA\nbusiness results, State Street allocates an\nincentive pool to SSGA to reward its\nemployees. The size of the incentive pool for\nmost business units is based on the firm\u2019s\noverall profitability and other factors,\nincluding performance against risk-related\ngoals. For most SSGA investment teams, SSGA\nrecognizes and rewards performance by linking\nannual incentive decisions for investment\nteams to the firm\u2019s or business unit\u2019s\nprofitability and business unit investment\nperformance over a multi-year period.\n\nIncentive pool funding for most active\ninvestment teams is driven in part by the\npost-tax investment performance of fund(s)\nmanaged by the team versus the return levels\nof the benchmark index(es) of the fund(s) on a\none-, three- and, in some cases, five-year\nbasis. For most active investment teams, a\nmaterial portion of incentive compensation for\nsenior staff is deferred over a four-year\nperiod into the SSGA Long-Term Incentive\n(\u201cSSGA LTI\u201d) program. For these teams, The\nSSGA LTI program indexes the performance of\nthese deferred awards against the post-tax\ninvestment performance of fund(s) managed by\nthe team. This is intended to align our\ninvestment team\u2019s compensation with client\ninterests, both through annual incentive\ncompensation awards and through the long-term\nvalue of deferred awards in the SSGA LTI\nprogram.\n\nFor the passive equity investment team,\nincentive pool funding is driven in part by\nthe post-tax 1 and 3-year tracking error of\nthe funds managed by the team against the\nbenchmark indexes of the funds.\n\nThe discretionary allocation of the incentive\npool to the business units within SSGA is\ninfluenced by market-based compensation data,\nas well as the overall performance of each\nbusiness unit. Individual compensation\ndecisions are made by the employee\u2019s manager,\nin conjunction with the senior management of\nthe employee\u2019s business unit. These decisions\nare based on the overall performance of the\nemployee and, as mentioned above, on the\nperformance of the firm and business unit.\nDepending on the job level, a portion of the\nannual incentive may be awarded in deferred\ncompensation, which may include cash and/or\nDeferred Stock Awards (State Street stock),\nwhich typically vest over a four-year period.\nThis helps to retain staff and further aligns\nSSGA employees\u2019 interests with SSGA clients\u2019\nand shareholders\u2019 long-term interests.\n\nSSGA recognizes and rewards outstanding\nperformance by:\n                                              \n       Promoting employee ownership to        \n  \u2022    connect employees directly to the      \n       company\u2019s success.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Using rewards to reinforce mission,    \n       vision, values and business strategy.  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Seeking to recognize and preserve the  \n  \u2022    firm\u2019s unique culture and team         \n       orientation.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Providing all employees the            \n  \u2022    opportunity to share in the success    \n       of SSGA.                               \n                                              \nSPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF\nand SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate\nBond ETF.

These decisions\nare based on the overall performance of the\nemployee and, as mentioned above, on the\nperformance of the firm and business unit.\nDepending on the job level, a portion of the\nannual incentive may be awarded in deferred\ncompensation, which may include cash and/or\nDeferred Stock Awards (State Street stock),\nwhich typically vest over a four-year period.\nThis helps to retain staff and further aligns\nSSGA employees\u2019 interests with SSGA clients\u2019\nand shareholders\u2019 long-term interests.\n\nSSGA recognizes and rewards outstanding\nperformance by:\n                                              \n       Promoting employee ownership to        \n  \u2022    connect employees directly to the      \n       company\u2019s success.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Using rewards to reinforce mission,    \n       vision, values and business strategy.  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Seeking to recognize and preserve the  \n  \u2022    firm\u2019s unique culture and team         \n       orientation.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Providing all employees the            \n  \u2022    opportunity to share in the success    \n       of SSGA.                               \n                                              \nTHE ADMINISTRATOR, SUB-ADMINISTRATOR,\nCUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT\n\nAdministrator.

These amounts,\nwhich may be significant, are paid by the\nAdviser and/or Distributor from their own\nresources and not from Fund assets. Pursuant\nto these arrangements, Pershing, RBC and LPL\nhave agreed to offer certain SPDR funds to\ntheir customers and not to charge certain of\ntheir customers any commissions when those\ncustomers purchase or sell shares of certain\nSPDR funds. Payments to a broker-dealer or\nintermediary may create potential conflicts of\ninterest between the broker dealer or\nintermediary and its clients.\n\nIn addition, the Adviser or Distributor, or an\naffiliate of the Adviser or Distributor, as\nwell as an index provider that is not\naffiliated with the Adviser or Distributor,\nmay reimburse expenses or make payments from\ntheir own assets to other persons in\nconsideration of services, provision of data,\nor other activities that they believe may\nbenefit the SPDR business or facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds.\n\nThe Distribution Agreement provides that it\nmay be terminated at any time, without the\npayment of any penalty, as to a Fund: (i) by\nvote of a majority of the Independent Trustees\nor (ii) by vote of a majority (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund, on at least 60 days\nwritten notice to the Distributor.

Such Soliciting\nDealers may also be Participating Parties (as\ndefined in the \u201cBook Entry Only System\u201d\nsection below) and/or DTC Participants (as\ndefined below).\n\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the\nTrust has agreed to indemnify the Distributor,\nand may indemnify Soliciting Dealers and\nAuthorized Participants (as described below)\nentering into agreements with the Distributor,\nfor certain liabilities, including certain\nliabilities arising under the federal\nsecurities laws, unless such loss or liability\nresults from willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence in the performance of its\nduties or the reckless disregard of its\nobligations and duties under the Distribution\nAgreement or other agreement, as applicable.\n\nINDEX PROVIDER AND OTHER PERSONS\n\nAn unaffiliated index provider may make\npayments from its own assets to other persons\nin consideration for services provided or\nother activities that may facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds.\n                                              \n            BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS            \n                                              \nAll portfolio transactions are placed on\nbehalf of the Funds by the Adviser. Purchases\nand sales of securities on a securities\nexchange are affected through brokers who\ncharge a commission for their services.\nOrdinarily commissions are not charged on over\nthe counter orders (e.g., fixed income\nsecurities) because the Funds pay a spread\nwhich is included in the cost of the security\nand represents the difference between the\ndealer\u2019s quoted price at which it is willing\nto sell the security and the dealer\u2019s quoted\nprice at which it is willing to buy the\n                      40                      \nsecurity. When a Fund executes an over the\ncounter order with an electronic\ncommunications network or an alternative\ntrading system, a commission is charged by\nsuch electronic communications networks and\nalternative trading systems as they execute\nsuch orders on an agency basis.

The Adviser does not\nnecessarily select a trading counterparty\nbased upon price and costs but may take other\nrelevant factors into account if it believes\nthat these are important in taking reasonable\nsteps to obtain the best possible result for a\nFund under the circumstances. Consequently,\nthe Adviser may cause a client to pay a\ntrading counterparty more than another trading\ncounterparty might have charged for the same\ntransaction in recognition of the value and\nquality of the brokerage services provided.\nThe following matters may influence the\nrelative importance that the Adviser places\nupon the relevant factors:\n\n(i) The nature and characteristics of the\norder or transaction. For example, size of\norder, market impact of order, limits, or\nother instructions relating to the order;\n\n(ii) The characteristics of the financial\ninstrument(s) or other assets which are the\nsubject of that order. For example, whether\nthe order pertains to an equity, fixed income,\nderivative or convertible instrument;\n                      41                      \n(iii) The characteristics of the execution\nvenues to which that order can be directed, if\nrelevant. For example, availability and\ncapabilities of electronic trading systems;\n\n(iv) Whether the transaction is a \u2018delivery\nversus payment\u2019 or \u2018over the counter\u2019\ntransaction. The creditworthiness of the\ntrading counterparty, the amount of existing\nexposure to a trading counterparty and trading\ncounterparty settlement capabilities may be\ngiven a higher relative importance in the case\nof \u2018over the counter\u2019 transactions; and/or\n\n(v) Any other circumstances that the Adviser\nbelieves are relevant at the time.\n\nThe process by which trading counterparties\nare selected to effect transactions is\ndesigned to exclude consideration of the sales\nefforts conducted by broker-dealers in\nrelation to the Funds.\n\nThe Adviser does not currently use the Funds\u2019\nassets in connection with third party soft\ndollar arrangements. While the Adviser does\nnot currently use \u201csoft\u201d or commission dollars\npaid by the Funds for the purchase of third\nparty research, the Adviser reserves the right\nto do so in the future.\n\nThe table below shows the aggregate dollar\namount of brokerage commissions paid by SPDR\nBloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF for\nthe past two fiscal years ended December 31,\nthe period from July 1, 2019 to December 31,\n2019 and for the fiscal year ended June 30.\nNone of the brokerage commissions paid were\npaid to affiliated brokers and the SPDR\nBloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF,\nSPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond\nETF, SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International\nTreasury Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International\nGovernment Inflation-Protected Bond ETF did\nnot pay any brokerage commissions.

Except in the limited circumstance\nprovided below, certificates will not be\nissued for Shares.\n\nDTC, a limited-purpose trust company, was\ncreated to hold securities of its participants\n(the \u201cDTC Participants\u201d) and to facilitate the\nclearance and settlement of securities\ntransactions among the DTC Participants in\nsuch securities through electronic book-entry\nchanges in accounts of the DTC Participants,\nthereby eliminating the need for physical\nmovement of securities certificates. DTC\nParticipants include securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and certain other organizations,\nsome of whom (and/or their representatives)\nown DTC. More specifically, DTC is owned by a\nnumber of its DTC Participants and by the New\nYork Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) and FINRA. Access\nto the DTC system is also available to others\nsuch as banks, brokers, dealers and trust\ncompanies that clear through or maintain a\ncustodial relationship with a DTC Participant,\neither directly or indirectly (the \u201cIndirect\nParticipants\u201d).\n                      42                      \nBeneficial ownership of Shares is limited to\nDTC Participants, Indirect Participants and\npersons holding interests through DTC\nParticipants and Indirect Participants.\nOwnership of beneficial interests in Shares\n(owners of such beneficial interests are\nreferred to herein as \u201cBeneficial Owners\u201d) is\nshown on, and the transfer of ownership is\neffected only through, records maintained by\nDTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on\nthe records of DTC Participants (with respect\nto Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of Shares.\n\nConveyance of all notices, statements and\nother communications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the Shares of each\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust,\neither directly or through a third party\nservice, shall inquire of each such DTC\nParticipant as to the number of Beneficial\nOwners holding Shares, directly or indirectly,\nthrough such DTC Participant. The Trust,\neither directly or through a third party\nservice, shall provide each such DTC\nParticipant with copies of such notice,\nstatement or other communication, in such\nform, number and at such place as such DTC\nParticipant may reasonably request, in order\nthat such notice, statement or communication\nmay be transmitted by such DTC Participant,\ndirectly or indirectly, to such Beneficial\nOwners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to\neach such DTC Participant and/or third party\nservice a fair and reasonable amount as\nreimbursement for the expenses attendant to\nsuch transmittal, all subject to applicable\nstatutory and regulatory requirements.\n\nShare distributions shall be made to DTC or\nits nominee, Cede & Co., as the registered\nholder of all Shares. DTC or its nominee, upon\nreceipt of any such distributions, shall\ncredit immediately DTC Participants\u2019 accounts\nwith payments in amounts proportionate to\ntheir respective beneficial interests in\nShares of a Fund as shown on the records of\nDTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC\nParticipants to Indirect Participants and\nBeneficial Owners of Shares held through such\nDTC Participants will be governed by standing\ninstructions and customary practices, as is\nnow the case with securities held for the\naccounts of customers in bearer form or\nregistered in a \u201cstreet name,\u201d and will be the\nresponsibility of such DTC Participants.\n\nThe Trust has no responsibility or liability\nfor any aspects of the records relating to or\nnotices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made\non account of beneficial ownership interests\nin such Shares, or for maintaining,\nsupervising or reviewing any records relating\nto such beneficial ownership interests or for\nany other aspect of the relationship between\nDTC and the DTC Participants or the\nrelationship between such DTC Participants and\nthe Indirect Participants and Beneficial\nOwners owning through such DTC Participants.\n\nDTC may determine to discontinue providing its\nservice with respect to Shares at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action\neither to find a replacement for DTC to\nperform its functions at a comparable cost or,\nif such a replacement is unavailable, to issue\nand

The principal\nconsideration for creations and redemptions\nfor each Fund is in-kind, although this may be\nrevised at any time without notice.\n\nPURCHASE (CREATION). The Trust issues and\nsells Shares of each Fund only: in Creation\nUnits on a continuous basis through the\nPrincipal Underwriter, without a sales load\n(but subject to transaction fees), at their\nNAV per share next determined after receipt of\nan order, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), in proper form pursuant to the terms\nof the Authorized Participant Agreement\n(\u201cParticipant Agreement\u201d). A \u201cBusiness Day\u201d\nwith respect to a Fund is, generally, any day\non which the NYSE is open for business,\nalthough the Funds will also not be open for\norders on Veterans Day and Columbus Day.\n\nFUND DEPOSIT. The consideration for purchase\nof a Creation Unit of a Fund generally\nconsists of either (i) the Deposit Securities\nand the Cash Component (defined below),\ncomputed as described below or (ii) the cash\nvalue of the Deposit Securities and the \u201cCash\nComponent,\u201d computed as described below. When\naccepting purchases of Creation Units for\ncash, a Fund may incur additional costs\nassociated with the acquisition of Deposit\nSecurities that would otherwise be provided by\nan in-kind purchaser.\n\nTogether, the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, and the Cash Component\nconstitute the \u201cFund Deposit,\u201d which\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent\ninvestment amount for a Creation Unit of a\nFund. The \u201cCash Component,\u201d which may include\na Dividend Equivalent Payment, is an amount\nequal to the difference between the net asset\nvalue of the Shares (per Creation Unit) and\nthe market value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable. The \u201cDividend\nEquivalent Payment\u201d enables a Fund to make a\ncomplete distribution of dividends on the day\npreceding the next dividend payment date, and\nis an amount equal, on a per Creation Unit\nbasis, to the dividends on all the portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund (\u201cDividend Securities\u201d)\nwith ex-dividend dates within the accumulation\nperiod for such distribution (the\n\u201cAccumulation Period\u201d), net of expenses and\nliabilities for such period, as if all of the\nDividend Securities had been held by the Fund\nfor the entire Accumulation Period. The\nAccumulation Period begins on the ex-dividend\ndate for each Fund and ends on the day\npreceding the next ex-dividend date. If the\nCash Component is a positive number (i.e., the\nnet asset value per Creation Unit exceeds the\nmarket value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash\nComponent shall be such positive amount. If\nthe Cash Component is a negative number (i.e.,\nthe net asset value per Creation Unit is less\nthan the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable),\nthe Cash Component shall be such negative\namount and the creator will be entitled to\nreceive cash in an amount equal to the Cash\nComponent. The Cash Component serves the\nfunction of compensating for any differences\nbetween the net asset value per Creation Unit\nand the market value of the Deposit Securities\nor Deposit Cash, as applicable. Computation of\nthe Cash Component excludes any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities, if applicable, which shall\nbe the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below).\n\nThe Custodian, through NSCC, makes available\non each Business Day, prior to the opening of\nbusiness on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m.,\nEastern time), the list of the names and the\nrequired number of shares of each Deposit\nSecurity or the required amount of Deposit\nCash, as applicable, to be included in the\ncurrent standard Fund Deposit (based on\ninformation at the end of the previous\nBusiness Day) for a Fund. Such standard Fund\nDeposit is subject to any applicable\nadjustments as described below, in order to\neffect purchases of Creation Units of a Fund\nuntil such time as the next-announced\ncomposition of the Deposit Securities or the\nrequired amount of Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, is made available.\n\nThe identity and number of shares of the\nDeposit Securities or the amount of Deposit\nCash, as applicable, required for a Fund\nDeposit for each Fund may be changed from time\nto time with a view to the investment\nobjective of the Fund. Information regarding\nthe Fund Deposit necessary for the purchase of\na Creation Unit is made available to\nAuthorized Participants and other market\nparticipants seeking to transact in Creation\nUnit aggregations.\n\nThe Trust intends to require the substitution\nof an amount of cash (i.e., a \u201ccash in lieu\u201d\namount) to replace any Deposit Security that\nis a TBA transaction. The amount of cash\ncontributed will be equivalent to the price of\nthe TBA transaction listed as a Deposit\nSecurity. As noted above, the Trust reserves\nthe right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of Deposit Cash to replace any\nDeposit Security, which shall be added to the\nCash Component, including, without limitation,\nin situations where the Deposit Security: (i)\nmay not be available in sufficient quantity\nfor delivery, (ii) may not be eligible for\ntransfer through the systems of DTC for\ncorporate securities and municipal securities\nor the Federal Reserve System for U.S.\nTreasury securities; (iii) may not be eligible\nfor trading by an Authorized Participant (as\ndefined below) or the investor for which it is\nacting; (iv) would be restricted under the\nsecurities laws or where the delivery of the\nDeposit Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in the disposition of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant\nbecoming restricted under the securities laws,\nor (v) in certain other situations\n(collectively, \u201cnon-standard orders\u201d). The\nTrust also reserves the right to: (i) permit\nor require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of Deposit Cash; and (ii)\ninclude or remove Deposit Securities from the\nbasket in anticipation of portfolio changes.\nThe adjustments described above will reflect\nchanges, known to the Adviser on the date of\nannouncement to be in effect by the time of\ndelivery of the Fund Deposit, in the\ncomposition of the subject Index being tracked\nby the relevant Fund or resulting from certain\ncorporate actions.\n\nPROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION UNITS. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the Principal\nUnderwriter, as facilitated via the Transfer\nAgent, to purchase a Creation Unit of a Fund,\nan entity must be (i) a \u201cParticipating Party\u201d,\ni.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in\nthe clearing process through the Continuous\nNet Settlement System of the NSCC (the\n\u201cClearing Process\u201d), a clearing agency that is\nregistered with the SEC; or (ii) a DTC\nParticipant (see \u201cBook Entry Only System\u201d),\nand (except with respect to the SPDR Bloomberg\nInternational Treasury Bond ETF and SPDR\nBloomberg Short Term International Treasury\nBond ETF) must have the ability to clear\nthrough the Federal Reserve System. In\naddition, each Participating Party or DTC\nParticipant (each, an \u201cAuthorized\nParticipant\u201d) must execute a\n                      44                      \nParticipant Agreement that has been agreed to\nby the Principal Underwriter and the Transfer\nAgent, and that has been accepted by the\nTrust, with respect to purchases and\nredemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized\nParticipant will agree, pursuant to the terms\nof a Participant Agreement, on behalf of\nitself or any investor on whose behalf it will\nact, to certain conditions, including that it\nwill pay to the Trust, an amount of cash\nsufficient to pay the Cash Component together\nwith the creation transaction fee (described\nbelow) and any other applicable fees, taxes\nand additional variable charge.\n\nAll orders to purchase Shares directly from a\nFund, including non-standard orders, must be\nplaced for one or more Creation Units and in\nthe manner and by the time set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement and/or the applicable\norder form. The date on which an order to\npurchase Creation Units (or an order to redeem\nCreation Units, as set forth below) is\nreceived and accepted is referred to as the\n\u201cOrder Placement Date.\u201d\n\nAn Authorized Participant may require an\ninvestor to make certain representations or\nenter into agreements with respect to the\norder (e.g., to provide for payments of cash,\nwhen required). Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not have executed\na Participant Agreement and that, therefore,\norders to purchase Shares directly from a Fund\nin Creation Units have to be placed by the\ninvestor\u2019s broker through an Authorized\nParticipant that has executed a Participant\nAgreement. In such cases there may be\nadditional charges to such investor. At any\ngiven time, there may be only a limited number\nof broker-dealers that have executed a\nParticipant Agreement and only a small number\nof such Authorized Participants may have\ninternational capabilities.\n\nOn days when the Exchange or the bond markets\nclose earlier than normal, a Fund may require\norders to create Creation Units to be placed\nearlier in the day. In addition, if a market\nor markets on which a Fund\u2019s investments are\nprimarily traded is closed, the Fund will also\ngenerally not accept orders on such day(s).\nOrders must be transmitted by an Authorized\nParticipant by telephone or other transmission\nmethod acceptable to the Distributor pursuant\nto procedures set forth in the Participant\nAgreement and in accordance with the\napplicable order form. Those placing orders\nthrough an Authorized Participant should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe purchase order by the cut-off time.\nEconomic or market disruptions or changes, or\ntelephone or other communication failure may\nimpede the ability to reach the Distributor or\nan Authorized Participant.\n\nFund Deposits must be delivered by an\nAuthorized Participant through the Federal\nReserve System (for cash and U.S. government\nsecurities), or through DTC (for corporate\nsecurities and municipal securities), through\na subcustody agent (for foreign securities)\nand/or through such other arrangements allowed\nby the Trust or its agents. With respect to\nforeign Deposit Securities, the Custodian\nshall cause the subcustodian of a Fund to\nmaintain an account into which the Authorized\nParticipant shall deliver, on behalf of itself\nor the party on whose behalf it is acting,\nsuch Deposit Securities. Foreign Deposit\nSecurities must be delivered to an account\nmaintained at the applicable local\nsubcustodian. The Fund Deposit transfer must\nbe ordered by the Authorized Participant in a\ntimely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of\nthe requisite number of Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable, to the account of\na Fund or its agents by no later than the\nSettlement Date. The \u201cSettlement Date\u201d for a\nFund is generally the second Business Day\n(\u201cT+2\u201d) after the Order Placement Date. The\nSettlement Date for the SPDR Bloomberg\nEmerging Markets Local Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE\nInternational Government Inflation-Protected\nBond ETF is the third Business Day (\u201cT+3\u201d)\nafter the Order Placement Date.\n\nAll questions as to the number of Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as\napplicable, and the validity, form and\neligibility (including time of receipt) for\nthe deposit of any tendered securities or\ncash, as applicable, will be determined by the\nTrust, whose determination shall be final and\nbinding. The amount of cash represented by the\nCash Component must be transferred directly to\nthe Custodian through the Federal Reserve Bank\nwire transfer system in a timely manner so as\nto be received by the Custodian no later than\nthe Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and\nthe Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, are not received in a timely\nmanner by the Settlement Date, the creation\norder may be cancelled. Upon written notice to\nthe Distributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the following Business Day using a\nFund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect\nthe then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery\nof Creation Units so created generally will\noccur no later than the second Business Day\nfollowing the day on which the purchase order\nis deemed received by the Distributor.\nDelivery of Creation Units will occur no later\nthan the third Business Day following the day\non which the purchase order is deemed received\nby the Distributor for the SPDR Bloomberg\nEmerging Markets Local Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE\nInternational Government Inflation-Protected\nBond ETF.\n\nThe order shall be deemed to be received on\nthe Business Day on which the order is placed\nprovided that the order is placed in proper\nform prior to the applicable cut-off time and\nthe federal funds in the appropriate amount\nare deposited by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions),\nwith the Custodian on the Settlement Date. If\nthe order is not placed in proper form as\nrequired, or federal funds in the appropriate\namount are not received by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00\np.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, then the\norder may be deemed to be rejected and the\nAuthorized Participant shall be liable to the\nFund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom.\nA creation request is considered to be in\n\u201cproper form\u201d if all procedures set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, order form and this\nSAI are properly followed.\n\nISSUANCE OF A CREATION UNIT. Except as\nprovided herein, Creation Units will not be\nissued until the transfer of good title to the\nTrust of the Deposit Securities or payment of\nDeposit Cash, as applicable, and the payment\nof the Cash Component have been completed.\nWhen the subcustodian has confirmed to the\nCustodian that the required Deposit Securities\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant\nsubcustodian or subcustodians, the Principal\nUnderwriter and the Adviser shall be notified\nof such delivery, and the Trust will issue and\ncause the delivery of the Creation Units.\n                      45                      \nIn instances where the Trust accepts Deposit\nSecurities for the purchase of a Creation\nUnit, the Creation Unit may be purchased in\nadvance of receipt by the Trust of all or a\nportion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nas described below. In these circumstances,\nthe initial deposit will have a value greater\nthan the net asset value of the Shares on the\ndate the order is placed in proper form since\nin addition to available Deposit Securities,\ncash must be deposited in an amount equal to\nthe sum of (i) the Cash Component, plus (ii)\nan additional amount of cash equal to a\npercentage of the market value as set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, of the undelivered\nDeposit Securities (the \u201cAdditional Cash\nDeposit\u201d), which shall be maintained in a\ngeneral non-interest bearing collateral\naccount. An additional amount of cash shall be\nrequired to be deposited with the Trust,\npending delivery of the missing Deposit\nSecurities to the extent necessary to maintain\nthe Additional Cash Deposit with the Trust in\nan amount at least equal to the applicable\npercentage, as set forth in the Participant\nAgreement, of the daily marked to market value\nof the missing Deposit Securities. The Trust\nmay use such Additional Cash Deposit to buy\nthe missing Deposit Securities at any time.\nAuthorized Participants will be liable to the\nTrust for all costs, expenses, dividends,\nincome and taxes associated with missing\nDeposit Securities, including the costs\nincurred by the Trust in connection with any\nsuch purchases. These costs will be deemed to\ninclude the amount by which the actual\npurchase price of the Deposit Securities\nexceeds the market value of such Deposit\nSecurities on the day the purchase order was\ndeemed received by the Principal Underwriter\nplus the brokerage and related transaction\ncosts associated with such purchases. The\nTrust will return any unused portion of the\nAdditional Cash Deposit once all of the\nmissing Deposit Securities have been properly\nreceived by the Custodian or purchased by the\nTrust and deposited into the Trust. In\naddition, a transaction fee as set forth below\nunder \u201cCreation Transaction Fees\u201d will be\ncharged in all cases and an additional\nvariable charge may also be applied. The\ndelivery of Creation Units so created\ngenerally will occur no later than the\nSettlement Date.\n\nACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF CREATION UNITS. The\nTrust reserves the right to reject an order\nfor Creation Units transmitted in respect of a\nFund at its discretion, including, without\nlimitation, if (a) the order is not in proper\nform or the Deposit Securities delivered do\nnot consist of the securities that the\nCustodian specified; (b) the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable,\ndelivered by the Authorized Participant are\nnot as disseminated through the facilities of\nthe NSCC for that date by the Custodian; (c)\nthe investor(s), upon obtaining the Shares\nordered, would own 80% or more of the\ncurrently outstanding Shares of the Fund; (d)\nthe acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in\nthe opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (e) the\nacceptance or receipt of the order for a\nCreation Unit would, in the opinion of counsel\nto the Trust, be unlawful; or (f) in the event\nthat circumstances outside the control of the\nTrust, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent, the\nDistributor and/or the Adviser make it for all\npractical purposes not feasible to process\norders for Creation Units. Examples of such\ncircumstances include acts of God or public\nservice or utility problems such as fires,\nfloods, extreme weather conditions and power\noutages resulting in telephone, telecopy and\ncomputer failures; market conditions or\nactivities causing trading halts; systems\nfailures involving computer or other\ninformation systems affecting the Trust, the\nPrincipal Underwriter, the Custodian, the\nTransfer Agent, DTC, NSCC, Federal Reserve\nSystem, or any other participant in the\ncreation process, and other extraordinary\nevents. The Trust or its agents shall\ncommunicate to the Authorized Participant its\nrejection of an order. The Trust, the Transfer\nAgent, the Custodian and the Principal\nUnderwriter are under no duty, however, to\ngive notification of any defects or\nirregularities in the delivery of Fund\nDeposits nor shall either of them incur any\nliability for the failure to give any such\nnotification. The Trust, the Transfer Agent,\nthe Custodian and the Principal Underwriter\nshall not be liable for the rejection of any\npurchase order for Creation Units. Given the\nimportance of the ongoing issuance of Creation\nUnits to maintaining a market price that is at\nor close to the underlying net asset value of\na Fund, the Trust does not intend to suspend\nacceptance of orders for Creation Units.\n\nAll questions as to the number of shares of\neach security in the Deposit Securities and\nthe validity, form, eligibility and acceptance\nfor deposit of any securities to be delivered\nshall be determined by the Trust, and the\nTrust\u2019s determination shall be final and\nbinding.\n\nREDEMPTION. Shares may be redeemed only in\nCreation Units at their net asset value next\ndetermined after receipt of a redemption\nrequest in proper form by a Fund through the\nTransfer Agent and only on a Business Day.\nEXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF A FUND, THE TRUST\nWILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN AMOUNTS LESS THAN\nCREATION UNITS. Investors must accumulate\nenough Shares in the secondary market to\nconstitute a Creation Unit in order to have\nsuch Shares redeemed by the Trust. There can\nbe no assurance, however, that there will be\nsufficient liquidity in the public trading\nmarket at any time to permit assembly of a\nCreation Unit. Investors should expect to\nincur brokerage and other costs in connection\nwith assembling a sufficient number of Shares\nto constitute a redeemable Creation Unit.\n\nWith respect to each Fund, the Custodian,\nthrough the NSCC, makes available prior to the\nopening of business on the Exchange (currently\n9:30 a.m. Eastern time) on each Business Day,\nthe list of the names and share quantities of\nsecurities designated by the Fund that will be\napplicable (subject to possible amendment or\ncorrection) to redemption requests received in\nproper form (as defined below) on that day\n(\u201cRedemption Securities\u201d). Redemption\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit Securities. The identity\nand number of shares of the Redemption\nSecurities or the Cash Redemption Amount\n(defined below) may be changed from time to\ntime with a view to the investment objective\nof a Fund.\n\nRedemption proceeds for a Creation Unit are\npaid either in-kind or in cash, or a\ncombination thereof, as determined by the\nTrust. With respect to in-kind redemptions of\na Fund, redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit will consist of Redemption Securities\nplus cash in an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the net asset value of the Fund Shares\nbeing redeemed, as next determined after a\nreceipt of a request in proper form, and the\nvalue of the Redemption Securities (the \u201cCash\nRedemption Amount\u201d), less a fixed redemption\ntransaction fee and any applicable additional\nvariable charge as set forth below. In the\nevent that the Redemption Securities have a\nvalue greater than the net asset value of the\nFund Shares, a compensating cash payment equal\nto the differential is required to be made by\nor through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, at the Trust\u2019s discretion, an\nAuthorized Participant may receive the\ncorresponding cash value of the securities in\nlieu of the in-kind securities value\nrepresenting one or more Redemption\nSecurities.\n                      46                      \nPROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS.\nAfter the Trust has deemed an order for\nredemption received, the Trust will initiate\nprocedures to transfer the requisite\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to the Authorized Participant by the\nSettlement Date. With respect to in-kind\nredemptions of a Fund, the calculation of the\nvalue of the Redemption Securities and the\nCash Redemption Amount to be delivered upon\nredemption will be made by the Custodian\naccording to the procedures set forth under\n\u201cDetermination of Net Asset Value\u201d, computed\non the Business Day on which a redemption\norder is deemed received by the Trust.\nTherefore, if a redemption order in proper\nform is submitted to the Principal Underwriter\nby a DTC Participant by the specified time on\nthe Order Placement Date, and the requisite\nnumber of Shares of a Fund are delivered to\nthe Custodian prior to 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions) on\nthe Settlement Date, then the value of the\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to be delivered will be determined by\nthe Custodian on such Order Placement Date. If\nthe requisite number of Shares of the Fund are\nnot delivered by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions) on\nthe Settlement Date, the Fund will not release\nthe underlying securities for delivery unless\ncollateral is posted in such percentage amount\nof missing Shares as set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement (marked to market\ndaily).\n\nWith respect to in-kind redemptions of a Fund,\nin connection with taking delivery of shares\nof Redemption Securities upon redemption of\nCreation Units, an Authorized Participant must\nmaintain appropriate custody arrangements with\na qualified broker-dealer, bank or other\ncustody providers in each jurisdiction in\nwhich any of the Redemption Securities are\ncustomarily traded (or such other arrangements\nas allowed by the Trust or its agents), to\nwhich account such Redemption Securities will\nbe delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds generally will be made within two\nBusiness Days, or in the case of the SPDR\nBloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF and\nSPDR FTSE International Government Inflation-\nProtected Bond ETF within three Business Days,\nof the trade date.\n\nDue to the schedule of holidays in certain\ncountries, however, the delivery of in-kind\nredemption proceeds may take longer than two\nor three Business Days, as applicable, after\nthe day on which the redemption request is\nreceived in proper form. If the Authorized\nParticipant has not made appropriate\narrangements to take delivery of the\nRedemption Securities in the applicable\nforeign jurisdiction and it is not possible to\nmake other such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of the\nRedemption Securities in such jurisdiction,\nthe Trust may, in its discretion, exercise its\noption to redeem such Shares in cash, and the\nAuthorized Participant will be required to\nreceive its redemption proceeds in cash.\n\nIf it is not possible to make other such\narrangements, or if it is not possible to\neffect deliveries of the Redemption\nSecurities, the Trust may in its discretion\nexercise its option to redeem such Shares in\ncash, and the redeeming investor will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in\ncash. In addition, an investor may request a\nredemption in cash that a Fund may, in its\nsole discretion, permit. In either case, the\ninvestor will receive a cash payment equal to\nthe NAV of its Shares based on the NAV of\nShares of the relevant Fund next determined\nafter the redemption request is received in\nproper form (minus a redemption transaction\nfee and additional charge for requested cash\nredemptions specified above, to offset the\nTrust\u2019s brokerage and other transaction costs\nassociated with the disposition of Redemption\nSecurities). A Fund may also, in its sole\ndiscretion, upon request of a shareholder,\nprovide such redeemer a portfolio of\nsecurities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Redemption Securities but\ndoes not differ in net asset value.\n\nAn Authorized Participant submitting a\nredemption request is deemed to represent to\nthe Trust that, as of the close of the\nBusiness Day on which the redemption request\nwas submitted, it (or its client) will own\n(within the meaning of Rule 200 of Regulation\nSHO) or has arranged to borrow for delivery to\nthe Trust on or prior to the Settlement Date\nof the redemption request, the requisite\nnumber of Shares of the relevant Fund to be\nredeemed as a Creation Unit. In either case,\nthe Authorized Participant is deemed to\nacknowledge that: (i) it (or its client) has\nfull legal authority and legal right to tender\nfor redemption the requisite number of Shares\nof the applicable Fund and to receive the\nentire proceeds of the redemption; and (ii) if\nsuch Shares submitted for redemption have been\nloaned or pledged to another party or are the\nsubject of a repurchase agreement, securities\nlending agreement or any other arrangement\naffecting legal or beneficial ownership of\nsuch Shares being tendered, there are no\nrestrictions precluding the tender and\ndelivery of such Shares (including borrowed\nshares, if any) for redemption, free and clear\nof liens, on the redemption Settlement Date.\nThe Trust reserves the right to verify these\nrepresentations at its discretion, but will\ntypically require verification with respect to\na redemption request from a Fund in connection\nwith higher levels of redemption activity\nand/or short interest in the Fund. If the\nAuthorized Participant, upon receipt of a\nverification request, does not provide\nsufficient verification of its representations\nas determined by the Trust, the redemption\nrequest will not be considered to have been\nreceived in proper form and may be rejected by\nthe Trust.\n\nRedemptions of Shares for Redemption\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable federal and state securities laws\nand each Fund (whether or not it otherwise\npermits cash redemptions) reserves the right\nto redeem Creation Units for cash to the\nextent that the Trust could not lawfully\ndeliver specific Redemption Securities upon\nredemptions or could not do so without first\nregistering the Redemption Securities under\nsuch laws. An Authorized Participant or an\ninvestor for which it is acting subject to a\nlegal restriction with respect to a particular\nsecurity included in the Redemption Securities\napplicable to the redemption of Creation Units\nmay be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The\nAuthorized Participant may request the\nredeeming investor of the Shares to complete\nan order form or to enter into agreements with\nrespect to such matters as compensating cash\npayment. Further, an Authorized Participant\nthat is not a \u201cqualified institutional buyer,\u201d\n(\u201cQIB\u201d) as such term is defined under Rule\n144A of the Securities Act, will not be able\nto receive Redemption Securities that are\nrestricted securities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. An Authorized Participant may\nbe required by the Trust to provide a written\nconfirmation with respect to QIB status in\norder to receive Redemption Securities.\n                      47                      \nThe right of redemption may be suspended or\nthe date of payment postponed with respect to\na Fund (1) for any period during which the\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (2) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Exchange is\nsuspended or restricted; (3) for any period\nduring which an emergency exists as a result\nof which disposal of the Shares of the Fund or\ndetermination of the NAV of the Shares is not\nreasonably practicable; or (4) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\n\nREQUIRED EARLY ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS FOR\nCERTAIN INTERNATIONAL FUNDS. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, as described in the Participant\nAgreement and/or the applicable order form,\ncertain Funds may require orders to be placed\nprior to the trade date, as described in the\nParticipant Agreement or the applicable order\nform, in order to receive the trade date\u2019s net\nasset value. The cut-off time to receive the\ntrade date\u2019s net asset value will not precede\nthe calculation of the net asset value of a\nFund\u2019s shares on the prior Business Day.\nOrders to purchase Shares of such Funds that\nare submitted on the Business Day immediately\npreceding a holiday or a day (other than a\nweekend) that the equity markets in the\nrelevant foreign market are closed may not be\naccepted. Authorized Participants may be\nnotified that the cut-off time for an order\nmay be earlier on a particular Business Day,\nas described in the Participant Agreement and\nthe applicable order form.\n\nCREATION AND REDEMPTION TRANSACTION FEES. A\ntransaction fee, as set forth in the table\nbelow, is imposed for the transfer and other\ntransaction costs associated with the purchase\nor redemption of Creation Units, as\napplicable. Authorized Participants will be\nrequired to pay a fixed creation transaction\nfee and/or a fixed redemption transaction fee,\nas applicable, on a given day regardless of\nthe number of Creation Units created or\nredeemed on that day. A Fund may adjust the\ntransaction fee from time to time. An\nadditional charge or a variable charge\n(discussed below) will be applied to certain\ncreation and redemption transactions,\nincluding non-standard orders and whole or\npartial cash purchases or redemptions. With\nrespect to creation orders, Authorized\nParticipants are responsible for the costs of\ntransferring the securities constituting the\nDeposit Securities to the account of the Trust\nand with respect to redemption orders,\nAuthorized Participants are responsible for\nthe costs of transferring the Redemption\nSecurities from the Trust to their account or\non their order. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other such intermediary may\nalso be charged a fee for such services.\n\nCreation and Redemption Transaction Fees:\n                                              \n                                     MAXIMUM  \n                  TRANSACT\u2026       TRANSACTI\u2026  \n  FUND             FEE*, **         FEE*, **  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  SPDR                                        \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  Emerging     $      1,500    $       6,000  \n  Markets                                     \n  Local                                       \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  SPDR                                        \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  Internat\u2026    $      1,500    $       6,000  \n  Corporate                                   \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  SPDR                                        \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  Internat\u2026    $      1,500    $       6,000  \n  Treasury                                    \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  SPDR                                        \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  Short                                       \n  Term         $      1,500    $       6,000  \n  Internat\u2026                                   \n  Treasury                                    \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  SPDR FTSE                                   \n  Internat\u2026                                   \n  Governme\u2026    $      1,500    $       6,000  \n  Inflatio\u2026                                   \n  Bond ETF                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     From time to time, a Fund may waive all  \n     or a portion of its applicable           \n     transaction fee(s).

Expenses and fees,\nincluding the management fees, are accrued\ndaily and taken into account for purposes of\ndetermining NAV. The NAV of each Fund is\ncalculated by State Street and determined once\ndaily as of the close of the regular trading\nsession on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m.\nEastern time) on each day that such exchange\nis open. Creation/redemption order cut-off\ntimes may be earlier on any day that the\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation (or applicable exchange or market\non which a Fund\u2019s investments are traded)\nannounces an early closing time. Any assets or\nliabilities denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S.\ndollars at market rates on the date of\nvaluation (generally as of 4:00 p.m. London\ntime) as quoted by one or more sources.\n\nIn calculating a Fund\u2019s NAV per Share, the\nFund\u2019s investments are generally valued using\nmarket valuations. A market valuation\ngenerally means a valuation (i) obtained from\nan exchange, a pricing service, or a major\nmarket maker (or dealer), (ii) based on a\nprice quotation or other equivalent indication\nof value supplied by an exchange, a pricing\nservice, or a major market maker (or dealer)\nor (iii) based on amortized cost. A Fund\nrelies on a third-party service provider for\nassistance with the daily calculation of the\nFund\u2019s NAV. The third-party\n                      48                      \nservice provider, in turn, relies on other\nparties for certain pricing data and other\ninputs used in the calculation of the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Therefore, a Fund is subject to certain\noperational risks associated with reliance on\nits service provider and that service\nprovider\u2019s sources of pricing and other data.\nNAV calculation may be adversely affected by\noperational risks arising from factors such as\nerrors or failures in systems and technology.\nSuch errors or failures may result in an\ninaccurately calculated NAV, delays in the\ncalculation of a NAV and/or the inability to\ncalculate a NAV over extended time periods. A\nFund may be unable to recover any losses\nassociated with such failures. In the case of\nshares of other funds that are not traded on\nan exchange, a market valuation means such\nfund\u2019s published NAV per share. A price\nobtained from a pricing service based on such\npricing service\u2019s valuation matrix may be\nconsidered a market valuation. The Adviser may\nuse various pricing services, or discontinue\nthe use of any pricing service, as approved by\nthe Board from time to time. Fixed-income\nassets are generally valued as of the\nannounced closing time for trading in fixed-\nincome instruments in a particular market or\nexchange, and generally 4:00 p.m. EST for U.S.\nfixed-income assets. Fixed-income assets are\ngenerally valued at the mean of the bid and\nask prices for bank loans and inflation\nprotected securities, and at the bid price for\nall other fixed-income assets.\n\nIn the event that current market valuations\nare not readily available or are deemed\nunreliable, the Trust\u2019s procedures require the\nOversight Committee to determine a security\u2019s\nfair value. In determining such value the\nOversight Committee may consider, among other\nthings, (i) price comparisons among multiple\nsources, (ii) a review of corporate actions\nand news events, and (iii) a review of\nrelevant financial indicators (e.g., movement\nin interest rates, market indices, and prices\nfrom each Fund\u2019s Index Provider). In these\ncases, the Fund\u2019s NAV may reflect certain\nportfolio securities\u2019 fair values rather than\ntheir market prices. The fair value of a\nportfolio instrument is generally the price\nwhich a Fund might reasonably expect to\nreceive upon its current sale in an orderly\nmarket between market participants.\nAscertaining fair value requires a\ndetermination of the amount that an\narm\u2019s-length buyer, under the circumstances,\nwould currently pay for the portfolio\ninstrument. Fair value pricing involves\nsubjective judgments and it is possible that\nthe fair value determination for a security is\nmaterially different than the value that could\nbe realized upon the sale of the security. In\naddition, fair value pricing could result in a\ndifference between the prices used to\ncalculate a Fund\u2019s NAV and the prices used by\nthe Fund\u2019s benchmark Index. This may result in\na difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the applicable Fund\u2019s\nbenchmark Index. With respect to securities\nthat are primarily listed on foreign\nexchanges, the value of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities may change on days when you will\nnot be able to purchase or sell your Shares.\n                                              \n         DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS          \n                                              \nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin each Prospectus entitled \u201cDISTRIBUTIONS.\u201d\n\nGENERAL POLICIES\n\nDividends from net investment income, if any,\nare generally declared and paid monthly by\neach Fund. Distributions of net realized\nsecurities gains, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid once a year, but the Trust\nmay make distributions on a more frequent\nbasis for a Fund to improve index tracking or\nto comply with the distribution requirements\nof the Internal Revenue Code, in all events in\na manner consistent with the provisions of the\n1940 Act.\n\nDividends and other distributions on Shares\nare distributed, as described below, on a pro\nrata basis to Beneficial Owners of such\nShares. Dividend payments are made through DTC\nParticipants and Indirect Participants to\nBeneficial Owners then of record with proceeds\nreceived from the Trust.\n\nManagement of the Trust reserves the right to\ndeclare special dividends if, in its\nreasonable discretion, such action is\nnecessary or advisable to preserve a Fund\u2019s\neligibility for treatment as a RIC under the\nInternal Revenue Code or to avoid imposition\nof income or excise taxes at the Fund level.\n\nDIVIDEND REINVESTMENT\n\nBroker dealers, at their own discretion, may\noffer a dividend reinvestment service under\nwhich Shares are purchased in the secondary\nmarket at current market prices. Investors\nshould consult their broker dealer for further\ninformation regarding any dividend\nreinvestment service offered by such broker\ndealer.\n                    TAXES                     \nThe following is a summary of certain federal\nincome tax considerations generally affecting\nthe Funds and their shareholders that\nsupplements the discussions in the Prospectus.\nNo attempt is made to present a comprehensive\nexplanation of the federal, state, local or\nforeign tax treatment of the Funds or their\nshareholders, and the discussion here and in\neach Prospectus is not intended to be a\nsubstitute for careful tax planning.\n                      49                      \nThe following general discussion of certain\nfederal income tax consequences is based on\nthe Internal Revenue Code and the regulations\nissued thereunder as in effect on the date of\nthis SAI. New legislation, as well as\nadministrative changes or court decisions, may\nsignificantly change the conclusions expressed\nherein, and may have a retroactive effect with\nrespect to the transactions contemplated\nherein.\n\nThe following information should be read in\nconjunction with the section in the Prospectus\nentitled \u201cADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION.\u201d\n\nTAXATION OF THE FUNDS. Each Fund is treated as\na separate corporation for federal income tax\npurposes. A Fund therefore is considered to be\na separate entity in determining its treatment\nunder the rules for RICs described herein and\nin the Prospectus. Losses in one series of the\nTrust do not offset gains in any other series\nof the Trust and the requirements (other than\ncertain organizational requirements) for\nqualifying for treatment as a RIC are\ndetermined at the Fund level rather than at\nthe Trust level. Each Fund has elected or will\nelect and intends to qualify each year to be\ntreated as a separate RIC under Subchapter M\nof the Internal Revenue Code. As such, each\nFund should not be subject to federal income\ntax on its net investment income and capital\ngains, if any, to the extent that it timely\ndistributes such income and capital gains to\nits shareholders. In order to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC, a Fund must distribute\nannually to its shareholders at least the sum\nof 90% of its taxable net investment income\n(generally including the excess of net short-\nterm capital gains over net long-term capital\nlosses) and 90% of its net tax-exempt interest\nincome, if any (the \u201cDistribution\nRequirement\u201d) and also must meet several\nadditional requirements. Among these\nrequirements are the following: (i) at least\n90% of a Fund\u2019s gross income each taxable year\nmust be derived from dividends, interest,\npayments with respect to certain securities\nloans, gains from the sale or other\ndisposition of stock, securities or foreign\ncurrencies, or other income derived with\nrespect to its business of investing in such\nstock, securities or currencies, and net\nincome derived from interests in qualified\npublicly traded partnerships (the \u201cQualifying\nIncome Requirement\u201d); and (ii) at the end of\neach quarter of a Fund\u2019s taxable year, its\nassets must be diversified so that (a) at\nleast 50% of the market value of its total\nassets must be represented by cash and cash\nitems, U.S. government securities, securities\nof other RICs and other securities, with such\nother securities limited, in respect to any\none issuer, to an amount not greater in value\nthan 5% of the value of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets and to not more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of its\ntotal assets is invested in the securities\n(other than U.S. government securities or\nsecurities of other RICs) of any one issuer,\nthe securities (other than securities of other\nRICs) of two or more issuers that it controls\nand that are engaged in the same, similar, or\nrelated trades or businesses, or the\nsecurities of one or more qualified publicly\ntraded partnerships (the \u201cDiversification\nRequirement\u201d).\n\nIf a Fund fails to satisfy the Qualifying\nIncome Requirement or the Diversification\nRequirement in any taxable year, the Fund may\nbe eligible for relief provisions if the\nfailures are due to reasonable cause and not\nwillful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid\nwith respect to each failure to satisfy the\napplicable requirements. Additionally, relief\nis provided for certain de minimis failures of\nthe Diversification Requirement where the Fund\ncorrects the failure within a specified period\nof time. In order to be eligible for the\nrelief provisions with respect to a failure to\nmeet the Diversification Requirement, a Fund\nmay be required to dispose of certain assets.\nIf these relief provisions were not available\nto a Fund and it were to fail to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all of\nits taxable income would be subject to tax at\nthe applicable corporate rate without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand its distributions (including capital gains\ndistributions) generally would be taxable as\nordinary income dividends to its shareholders,\nsubject to the dividends-received deduction\nfor corporate shareholders and the lower tax\nrates on qualified dividend income received by\nnoncorporate shareholders. To requalify for\ntreatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable\nyear, the Fund would be required to satisfy\nthe RIC qualification requirements for that\nyear and to distribute any earnings and\nprofits from any year in which the Fund failed\nto qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. If a\nFund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period\ngreater than two taxable years, it would\ngenerally be required to pay a Fund-level tax\non certain net built-in gains recognized with\nrespect to certain of its assets upon a\ndisposition of such assets within five years\nof qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year.\nThe Board reserves the right not to maintain\nthe qualification of a Fund for treatment as a\nRIC if it determines such course of action to\nbe beneficial to shareholders.\n\nAs discussed more fully below, each Fund\nintends to distribute substantially all of its\nnet investment income and its capital gains\nfor each taxable year.\n\nIf a Fund meets the Distribution Requirement\nbut retains some or all of its income or\ngains, it will be subject to federal income\ntax to the extent any such income or gains are\nnot distributed. A Fund may designate certain\namounts retained as undistributed net capital\ngain in a notice to its shareholders, who (i)\nwill be required to include in income for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, as long-term\ncapital gain, their proportionate shares of\nthe undistributed amount so designated, (ii)\nwill be entitled to credit their proportionate\nshares of the income tax paid by the Fund on\nthat undistributed amount against their\nfederal income tax liabilities and to claim\nrefunds to the extent such credits exceed\ntheir liabilities and (iii) will be entitled\nto increase their tax basis, for federal\nincome tax purposes, in their Shares by an\namount equal to the excess of the amount of\nundistributed net capital gain included in\ntheir respective income over their respective\nincome tax credits. If a Fund failed to\nsatisfy the Distribution Requirement for any\ntaxable year, it would be taxed as a regular\ncorporation, with consequences generally\nsimilar to those described in the preceding\nparagraph.\n                      50                      \nGiven the concentration of certain of the\nIndexes in a relatively small number of\nsecurities, it may not be possible for certain\nFunds to fully implement sampling\nmethodologies while satisfying the\nDiversification Requirement. A Fund\u2019s efforts\nto satisfy the Diversification Requirement may\naffect the Fund\u2019s execution of its investment\nstrategy and may cause the Fund\u2019s return to\ndeviate from that of the applicable Index, and\nthe Fund\u2019s efforts to track the applicable\nIndex may cause it inadvertently to fail to\nsatisfy the Diversification Requirement.\n\nA Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on\ncertain undistributed income if it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders in each\ncalendar year an amount at least equal to 98%\nof its ordinary income for the calendar year\nplus 98.2% of its capital gain net income for\nthe twelve months ended October 31 of such\nyear, subject to an increase for any shortfall\nin the prior year\u2019s distribution. Each Fund\nintends to declare and distribute dividends\nand distributions in the amounts and at the\ntimes necessary to avoid the application of\nthis 4% excise tax.\n\nA Fund may elect to treat part or all of any\n\u201cqualified late year loss\u201d as if it had been\nincurred in the succeeding taxable year in\ndetermining the Fund\u2019s taxable income, net\ncapital gain, net short-term capital gain, and\nearnings and profits. The effect of this\nelection is to treat any such \u201cqualified late\nyear loss\u201d as if it had been incurred in the\nsucceeding taxable year in characterizing Fund\ndistributions for any calendar year. A\n\u201cqualified late year loss\u201d generally includes\nnet capital loss, net long-term capital loss,\nor net short-term capital loss incurred after\nOctober 31 of the current taxable year\n(commonly referred to as \u201cpost-October\nlosses\u201d) and certain other late-year losses.\n\nCapital losses in excess of capital gains\n(\u201cnet capital losses\u201d) are not permitted to be\ndeducted against a RIC\u2019s net investment\nincome. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, potentially subject to certain\nlimitations, a Fund may carry a net capital\nloss from any taxable year forward\nindefinitely to offset its capital gains, if\nany, in years following the year of the loss.\nTo the extent subsequent capital gains are\noffset by such losses, they will not result in\nU.S. federal income tax liability to the Fund\nand may not be distributed as capital gains to\nits shareholders. Generally, the Funds may not\ncarry forward any losses other than net\ncapital losses.\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014DISTRIBUTIONS. Each\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income (computed\nwithout regard to the deduction for dividends\npaid), its net tax-exempt income, if any, and\nany net capital gain (net recognized long-term\ncapital gains in excess of net recognized\nshort-term capital losses, taking into account\nany capital loss carryforwards). Each Fund\nwill report to shareholders annually the\namounts of dividends paid from ordinary income\nand the amount of distributions of net capital\ngain. Since the Funds primarily hold\ninvestments that do not pay dividends, it is\nnot expected that a substantial portion (if\nany) of the dividends paid by a Fund will\nqualify for either the dividends-received\ndeduction for corporations or the favorable\nincome tax rates available to individuals on\nqualified dividend income.\n\nDistributions from a Fund\u2019s net short-term\ncapital gains will generally be taxable to\nshareholders as ordinary income. Distributions\nfrom a Fund\u2019s net capital gain will be taxable\nto shareholders at long-term capital gains\nrates, regardless of how long shareholders\nhave held their Shares. Long-term capital\ngains are generally taxed to noncorporate\nshareholders at reduced rates.\n\nAlthough dividends generally will be treated\nas distributed when paid, any dividend\ndeclared by a Fund in October, November or\nDecember and payable to shareholders of record\nin such a month that is paid during the\nfollowing January will be treated for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes as received by\nshareholders on December 31 of the calendar\nyear in which it was declared.\n\nIf a Fund\u2019s distributions exceed its earnings\nand profits, all or a portion of the\ndistributions made in the taxable year may be\ntreated as a return of capital to\nshareholders. A return of capital distribution\ngenerally will not be taxable but will reduce\nthe shareholder\u2019s cost basis and result in a\nhigher capital gain or lower capital loss when\nthe Shares on which the distribution was\nreceived are sold. After a shareholder\u2019s basis\nin the Shares has been reduced to zero,\ndistributions in excess of earnings and\nprofits will be treated as gain from the sale\nof the shareholder\u2019s Shares.\n\nUnder Section 163(j) of the Code, a taxpayer\u2019s\nbusiness interest expense is generally\ndeductible to the extent of its business\ninterest income plus certain other amounts. If\na Fund earns business interest income, it may\nreport a portion of its dividends as \u201cSection\n163(j) interest dividends,\u201d which its\nshareholders may be able to treat as business\ninterest income for purposes of Section 163(j)\nof the Code. The Fund\u2019s \u201cSection 163(j)\ninterest dividend\u201d for a tax year will be\nlimited to the excess of its business interest\nincome over the sum of its business interest\nexpense and other deductions properly\nallocable to its business interest income. In\ngeneral, a Fund\u2019s shareholders may treat a\ndistribution reported as a Section 163(j)\ninterest dividend as interest income only to\nthe extent the distribution exceeds the sum of\nthe portions of the distribution reported as\nother types of tax-favored income. To be\neligible to treat a Section 163(j) interest\ndividend as interest income, a shareholder may\nneed to meet certain holding period\nrequirements in respect of Fund Shares and\nmust not have hedged its position in Fund\nShares in certain ways.\n\nDistributions that are reinvested in\nadditional Shares of a Fund through the means\nof a dividend reinvestment service, if offered\nby your broker-dealer, will nevertheless be\ntaxable dividends to the same extent as if\nsuch dividends had been received in cash.\n\nA 3.8% Medicare contribution tax generally\napplies to all or a portion of the net\ninvestment income of a shareholder who is an\nindividual and not a nonresident alien for\nfederal income tax purposes and who has\nadjusted gross income (subject to certain\nadjustments) that exceeds a threshold amount\n($250,000 if married filing jointly or if\nconsidered a \u201csurviving spouse\u201d for federal\nincome tax purposes, $125,000 if\n                      51                      \nmarried filing separately, and $200,000 in\nother cases). This 3.8% tax also applies to\nall or a portion of the undistributed net\ninvestment income of certain shareholders that\nare estates and trusts. For these purposes,\ninterest, dividends and certain capital gains\n(generally including capital gain\ndistributions and capital gains realized on\nthe sale of Shares) are generally taken into\naccount in computing a shareholder\u2019s net\ninvestment income.\n\nDistributions of ordinary income and capital\ngains may also be subject to foreign, state\nand local taxes depending on a shareholder\u2019s\ncircumstances.\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014SALE OF SHARES. In\ngeneral, a sale of Shares results in capital\ngain or loss, and for individual shareholders,\nis taxable at a federal rate dependent upon\nthe length of time the Shares were held. A\nsale of Shares held for a period of one year\nor less at the time of such sale will, for tax\npurposes, generally result in short-term\ncapital gains or losses, and a sale of those\nheld for more than one year will generally\nresult in long-term capital gains or losses.\nLong-term capital gains are generally taxed to\nnoncorporate shareholders at reduced rates.\n\nGain or loss on the sale of Shares is measured\nby the difference between the amount received\nand the adjusted tax basis of the Shares.\nShareholders should keep records of\ninvestments made (including Shares acquired\nthrough reinvestment of dividends and\ndistributions) so they can compute the tax\nbasis of their Shares.\n\nA loss realized on a sale of Shares may be\ndisallowed if substantially identical Shares\nare acquired (whether through the reinvestment\nof dividends or otherwise) within a sixty-one\n(61) day period beginning thirty (30) days\nbefore and ending thirty (30) days after the\ndate that the Shares are disposed of. In such\na case, the basis of the Shares acquired must\nbe adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.\nAny loss upon the sale of Shares held for six\n(6) months or less will be treated as long-\nterm capital loss to the extent of any amounts\ntreated as distributions to the shareholder of\nlong-term capital gain (including any amounts\ncredited to the shareholder as undistributed\ncapital gains).\n\nCOST BASIS REPORTING. The cost basis of Shares\nacquired by purchase will generally be based\non the amount paid for the Shares and then may\nbe subsequently adjusted for other applicable\ntransactions as required by the Internal\nRevenue Code. The difference between the\nselling price and the cost basis of Shares\ngenerally determines the amount of the capital\ngain or loss realized on the sale or exchange\nof Shares. Contact the broker through whom you\npurchased your Shares to obtain information\nwith respect to the available cost basis\nreporting methods and elections for your\naccount.\n\nTAXATION OF FUND INVESTMENTS. Dividends and\ninterest received by a Fund on foreign\nsecurities may give rise to withholding and\nother taxes imposed by foreign countries. Tax\nconventions between certain countries and the\nUnited States may reduce or eliminate such\ntaxes. If a Fund meets certain requirements,\nwhich include a requirement that more than 50%\nof the value of the Fund\u2019s total assets at the\nclose of its respective taxable year consist\nof certain foreign securities (generally\nincluding foreign government securities), then\nthe Fund should be eligible to file an\nelection with the IRS that may enable its\nshareholders, in effect, to receive either the\nbenefit of a foreign tax credit, or a tax\ndeduction, with respect to certain foreign and\nU.S. possessions income taxes paid by the\nFund, subject to certain limitations. Pursuant\nto this election, a Fund would treat the\napplicable foreign taxes as dividends paid to\nits shareholders. Each such shareholder would\nbe required to include a proportionate share\nof those taxes in gross income as income\nreceived from a foreign source and must treat\nthe amount so included as if the shareholder\nhad paid the foreign tax directly. The\nshareholder may then either deduct the taxes\ndeemed paid by him or her in computing his or\nher taxable income or, alternatively, use the\nforegoing information in calculating any\nforeign tax credit the shareholder may be\nentitled to use against such shareholder\u2019s\nfederal income tax. If a Fund makes this\nelection, the Fund will report annually to its\nshareholders the respective amounts per share\nof the Fund\u2019s income from sources within, and\ntaxes paid to, foreign countries and U.S.\npossessions. No deduction for such taxes will\nbe permitted to individuals in computing their\nalternative minimum tax liability. If a Fund\ndoes not make this election, the Fund will be\nentitled to claim a deduction for certain\nforeign taxes incurred by the Fund. In certain\ninstances, the Fund might not elect to apply\notherwise allowable U.S. federal income tax\ndeductions for those foreign taxes, whether or\nnot credits or deductions for those foreign\ntaxes could be passed through to its\nshareholders pursuant to the election\ndescribed above. If the Fund does not elect to\napply these deductions, taxable distributions\nyou receive from the Fund may be larger than\nthey would have been if the Fund had taken\ndeductions for such taxes. Under certain\ncircumstances, if a Fund receives a refund of\nforeign taxes paid in respect of a prior year,\nthe value of Shares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions passed\nthrough to shareholders in respect of the\nFund\u2019s foreign taxes for the current year\ncould be reduced.\n\nCertain of the Funds\u2019 investments may be\nsubject to complex provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code (including provisions relating to\nhedging transactions, straddles, integrated\ntransactions, foreign currency contracts,\nforward foreign currency contracts, and\nnotional principal contracts) that, among\nother things, may affect the character of\ngains and losses realized by a Fund (e.g., may\naffect whether gains or losses are ordinary or\ncapital), accelerate recognition of income to\nthe Fund and defer losses. These rules could\ntherefore affect the character, amount and\ntiming of distributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also may require a Fund to mark-to-\nmarket certain types of positions in its\nportfolio (i.e., treat them as if they were\nclosed out) which may cause the Fund to\nrecognize income without receiving cash with\nwhich to make distributions to its\nshareholders in amounts necessary to satisfy\nthe RIC distribution requirements for avoiding\nincome and excise taxes. The Funds intend to\nmonitor their transactions, intend to make\nappropriate tax elections, and intend to make\nappropriate entries in their books and records\nin order to mitigate the effect of these rules\nand preserve the Funds\u2019 qualification for\ntreatment as RICs.\n                      52                      \nEach Fund is required for federal income tax\npurposes to mark-to-market and recognize as\nincome for each taxable year its net\nunrealized gains and losses on certain futures\ncontracts as of the end of the year as well as\nthose actually realized during the year. Gain\nor loss from futures and options contracts on\nbroad-based indexes required to be marked to\nmarket will be 60% long-term and 40% short-\nterm capital gain or loss. Application of this\nrule may alter the timing and character of\ndistributions to shareholders. A Fund may be\nrequired to defer the recognition of losses on\nfutures contracts, options contracts and swaps\nto the extent of any unrecognized gains on\noffsetting positions held by the Fund. It is\nanticipated that certain net gain realized\nfrom the closing out of futures or options\ncontracts will be considered gain from the\nsale of securities and therefore will be\nqualifying income for purposes of the\nQualifying Income Requirement.\n\nInvestments by a Fund in zero coupon or other\ndiscount securities will result in income to\nthe Fund equal to a portion of the excess face\nvalue of the securities over their issue price\n(the \u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or \u201cOID\u201d) each\nyear that the securities are held, even though\nthe Fund may receive no cash interest payments\nor may receive cash interest payments that are\nless than the income recognized for tax\npurposes. In other circumstances, whether\npursuant to the terms of a security or as a\nresult of other factors outside the control of\nthe Fund, a Fund may recognize income without\nreceiving a commensurate amount of cash. Such\nincome is included in determining the amount\nof income that a Fund must distribute to\nmaintain its eligibility for treatment as a\nRIC and to avoid the payment of federal income\ntax, including the nondeductible 4% excise tax\ndescribed above.\n\nAny market discount recognized on a market\ndiscount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A\nmarket discount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue, or below adjusted issue price if issued\nwith original issue discount. Absent an\nelection by a Fund to include the market\ndiscount in income as it accrues, gain on the\nFund\u2019s disposition of such an obligation will\nbe treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued\nmarket discount. Where the income required to\nbe recognized as a result of the OID and/or\nmarket discount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash receipt by a Fund, the Fund\nmay be required to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to enable the Fund to make\ndistributions to its shareholders in order to\nqualify for treatment as a RIC and eliminate\ntaxes at the Fund level.\n\nSpecial rules apply if a Fund holds inflation-\nindexed bonds, such as Treasury Inflation-\nProtected Securities (TIPS). Generally, all\nstated interest on inflation-indexed bonds is\ntaken into income by a Fund under its regular\nmethod of accounting for interest income. The\namount of any positive inflation adjustment\nfor a taxable year, which results from an\nincrease in the inflation-adjusted principal\namount of the bond, is treated as OID. The\namount of a Fund\u2019s OID in a taxable year with\nrespect to a bond will increase a Fund\u2019s\ntaxable income for such year without a\ncorresponding receipt of cash, until the bond\nmatures. As a result, the Fund may need to use\nother sources of cash to satisfy its\ndistribution requirements for the applicable\nyear. The amount of any negative inflation\nadjustments, which result from a decrease in\nthe inflation-adjusted principal amount of the\nbond, first reduces the amount of interest\n(including stated interest, OID, and market\ndiscount, if any) otherwise includable in the\nFund\u2019s taxable income with respect to the bond\nfor the taxable year; any remaining negative\nadjustments will be either treated as ordinary\nloss or, in certain circumstances, carried\nforward to reduce the amount of interest\nincome taken into account with respect to the\nbond in future taxable years.\n\nTAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS. Certain tax-exempt\nshareholders, including qualified pension\nplans, individual retirement accounts, salary\ndeferral arrangements, 401(k) plans, and other\ntax-exempt entities, generally are exempt from\nfederal income taxation except with respect to\ntheir unrelated business taxable income\n(\u201cUBTI\u201d). Under current law, a Fund generally\nserves to block UBTI from being realized by\nits tax-exempt shareholders. However,\nnotwithstanding the foregoing, tax-exempt\nshareholders could realize UBTI by virtue of\ntheir investment in a Fund where, for example,\n(i) the Fund invests in REITs that hold\nresidual interests in real estate mortgage\ninvestment conduits (\u201cREMICs\u201d) or (ii) Shares\nconstitute debt-financed property in the hands\nof the tax-exempt shareholders within the\nmeaning of section 514(b) of the Internal\nRevenue Code. Charitable remainder trusts are\nsubject to special rules and should consult\ntheir tax advisors. The IRS has issued\nguidance with respect to these issues and\nprospective shareholders, especially\ncharitable remainder trusts, are strongly\nencouraged to consult with their tax advisors\nregarding these issues.\n\nCertain tax-exempt educational institutions\nwill be subject to a 1.4% tax on net\ninvestment income. For these purposes, certain\ndividends and capital gain distributions, and\ncertain gains from the disposition of Shares\n(among other categories of income), are\ngenerally taken into account in computing a\nshareholder\u2019s net investment income.\n\nFOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS. Dividends, other than\ncapital gains dividends, \u201cshort-term capital\ngain dividends\u201d and \u201cinterest-related\ndividends\u201d (described below), paid by a Fund\nto shareholders who are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities will be subject to a 30%\nUnited States withholding tax unless a reduced\nrate of withholding or a withholding exemption\nis provided under applicable treaty law to the\nextent derived from investment income and\nshort-term capital gain or unless such income\nis effectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness carried on through a permanent\nestablishment in the United States.\nNonresident shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors concerning the\napplicability of the United States withholding\ntax and the proper withholding form(s) to be\nsubmitted to a Fund. A non-U.S. shareholder\nwho fails to provide an appropriate IRS Form\nW-8 may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate.\n\nDividends reported by a Fund as (i) interest-\nrelated dividends, to the extent such\ndividends are derived from the Fund\u2019s\n\u201cqualified net interest income,\u201d or (ii)\nshort-term capital gain dividends, to the\nextent such dividends are derived from the\nFund\u2019s \u201cqualified short-term gain,\u201d are\ngenerally exempt from this 30% withholding\ntax. \u201cQualified net interest income\u201d is a\nFund\u2019s net income derived from U.S.-source\ninterest and original issue discount, subject\nto certain exceptions and limitations.\n\u201cQualified short-term gain\u201d generally means\nthe excess of a Fund\u2019s net short-term capital\ngain for the taxable year over its net long-\nterm capital loss, if any. In the case of\nShares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if a Fund\nreports the payment as an interest-related\ndividend or as a short-term capital gain\ndividend. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact\ntheir intermediaries with respect to the\napplication of these rules to their accounts.\n                      53                      \nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold\nShares comply with IRS requirements that will\ngenerally require them to report information\nregarding U.S. persons investing in, or\nholding accounts with, such entities, a 30%\nwithholding tax may apply to Fund\ndistributions payable to such entities. A\nnon-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the\nwithholding described in this paragraph under\nan applicable intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the U.S. and a foreign government,\nprovided that the shareholder and the\napplicable foreign government comply with the\nterms of such agreement.\n\nBACKUP WITHHOLDING. A Fund will be required in\ncertain cases to withhold (as \u201cbackup\nwithholding\u201d) on amounts payable to any\nshareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been\nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the U.S.\n\nCREATION UNITS. An Authorized Participant who\nexchanges securities for Creation Units\ngenerally will recognize a gain or a loss. The\ngain or loss will be equal to the difference\nbetween the market value of the Creation Units\nat the time and the sum of the exchanger\u2019s\naggregate basis in the securities surrendered\nplus the amount of cash paid for such Creation\nUnits. A person who redeems Creation Units\nwill generally recognize a gain or loss equal\nto the difference between the exchanger\u2019s\nbasis in the Creation Units and the sum of the\naggregate market value of any securities\nreceived plus the amount of any cash received\nfor such Creation Units. The IRS, however, may\nassert that a loss realized upon an exchange\nof securities for Creation Units cannot be\ndeducted currently under the rules governing\n\u201cwash sales,\u201d or on the basis that there has\nbeen no significant change in economic\nposition.\n\nAny gain or loss realized upon a creation of\nCreation Units will be treated as capital gain\nor loss if the Authorized Participant holds\nthe securities exchanged therefor as capital\nassets, and otherwise will be ordinary income\nor loss. Similarly, any gain or loss realized\nupon a redemption of Creation Units will be\ntreated as capital gain or loss if the\nAuthorized Participant holds the Shares\ncomprising the Creation Units as capital\nassets, and otherwise will be ordinary income\nor loss. Any capital gain or loss realized\nupon the creation of Creation Units will\ngenerally be treated as long-term capital gain\nor loss if the securities exchanged for such\nCreation Units have been held for more than\none year, and otherwise will be short-term\ncapital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon the redemption of Creation Units\nwill generally be treated as long-term capital\ngain or loss if the Shares comprising the\nCreation Units have been held for more than\none year, and otherwise, will generally be\nshort-term capital gain or loss. Any capital\nloss realized upon a redemption of Creation\nUnits held for six (6) months or less will be\ntreated as a long-term capital loss to the\nextent of any amounts treated as distributions\nto the applicable Authorized Participant of\nlong-term capital gains with respect to the\nCreation Units (including any amounts credited\nto the Authorized Participant as undistributed\ncapital gains).\n\nA Fund has the right to reject an order for\nCreation Units if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Shares\nso ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding\nshares of the Fund and if, pursuant to section\n351 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund\nwould have a basis in any deposit securities\ndifferent from the market value of such\nsecurities on the date of deposit. A Fund also\nhas the right to require information necessary\nto determine beneficial Share ownership for\npurposes of the 80% determination. If a Fund\ndoes issue Creation Units to a purchaser (or a\ngroup of purchasers) that would, upon\nobtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80% or\nmore of the outstanding shares of the Fund,\nthe purchaser (or a group of purchasers) may\nnot recognize gain or loss upon the exchange\nof securities for Creation Units.\n\nIf a Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it\nmay bear additional costs and recognize more\ncapital gains than it would if it redeems\nCreation Units in kind.\n\nPersons purchasing or redeeming Creation Units\nshould consult their own tax advisors with\nrespect to the tax treatment of any creation\nor redemption transaction.\n\nCERTAIN POTENTIAL TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\nUnder promulgated Treasury regulations, if a\nshareholder recognizes a loss on disposition\nof a Fund\u2019s shares of $2 million or more for\nan individual shareholder or $10 million or\nmore for a corporate shareholder (or certain\ngreater amounts over a combination of years),\nthe shareholder must file with the IRS a\ndisclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct\nshareholders of portfolio securities are in\nmany cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not excepted. A\nshareholder who fails to make the required\ndisclosure to the IRS may be subject to\nadverse tax consequences, including\nsignificant penalties. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer\u2019s treatment of the loss is proper.\nShareholders should consult their tax advisers\nto determine the applicability of these\nregulations in light of their individual\ncircumstances.\n\nThe foregoing discussion is a summary only and\nis not intended as a substitute for careful\ntax planning. Purchasers of Shares should\nconsult their own tax advisors as to the tax\nconsequences of investing in such Shares,\nincluding under state, local and other tax\nlaws. Finally, the foregoing discussion is\nbased on applicable provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code, regulations, judicial authority\nand administrative interpretations in effect\non the date hereof. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.\n                      54                      \nSTATE TAX MATTERS. The discussion of state and\nlocal tax treatment is based on the\nassumptions that the Funds will qualify for\ntreatment under Subchapter M of the Internal\nRevenue Code as RICs and that each Fund will\ndistribute all interest and dividends it\nreceives to its shareholders. The tax\ndiscussion summarizes general state and local\ntax laws which are currently in effect and\nwhich are subject to change by legislative,\njudicial or administrative action; any such\nchanges may be retroactive with respect to the\napplicable Fund\u2019s transactions. Investors\nshould consult a tax advisor for more detailed\ninformation about state and local taxes to\nwhich they may be subject.\n\nMany states grant tax-free status to dividends\npaid to you from interest earned on direct\nobligations of the U.S. government, subject in\nsome states to minimum investment requirements\nthat must be met by the Fund. Investment in\nGovernment National Mortgage Association\n(\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d) or Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) securities,\nbanker\u2019s acceptances, commercial paper, and\nrepurchase agreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities do not generally qualify\nfor such tax-free treatment. The rules on\nexclusion of this income are different for\ncorporate shareholders.\n                                              \n      CAPITAL STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES      \n                                              \nEach Fund issues Shares of beneficial\ninterest, par value $.01 per Share. The Board\nmay designate additional funds.\n\nEach Share issued by the Trust has a pro rata\ninterest in the assets of the corresponding\nseries of the Trust. Shares have no\npreemptive, exchange, subscription or\nconversion rights and are freely transferable.\nEach Share is entitled to participate equally\nin dividends and distributions declared by the\nBoard with respect to each Fund, and in the\nnet distributable assets of each Fund on\nliquidation.\n\nEach Share has one vote with respect to\nmatters upon which a shareholder vote is\nrequired consistent with the requirements of\nthe 1940 Act and the rules promulgated\nthereunder. Shares of all series of the Trust\n(\u201cFunds\u201d) vote together as a single class\nexcept that if the matter being voted on\naffects only a particular fund it will be\nvoted on only by that fund and if a matter\naffects a particular fund differently from\nother Funds, that fund will vote separately on\nsuch matter. Under Massachusetts law, the\nTrust is not required to hold an annual\nmeeting of shareholders unless required to do\nso under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust\nis not to hold an annual meeting of\nshareholders unless required to do so under\nthe 1940 Act. All Shares of the Trust\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights for the election of Trustees.\nUnder Massachusetts law, Trustees of the Trust\nmay be removed by vote of the shareholders.\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, shareholders of a\nbusiness trust may, under certain\ncircumstances, be held personally liable as\npartners for obligations of the Trust.\nHowever, the Declaration of Trust contains an\nexpress disclaimer of shareholder liability\nfor acts or obligations of the Trust, requires\nthat Trust obligations include such\ndisclaimer, and provides for indemnification\nand reimbursement of expenses out of the\nTrust\u2019s property for any shareholder held\npersonally liable for the obligations of the\nTrust. Thus, the risk of a shareholder\nincurring financial loss on account of\nshareholder liability is limited to\ncircumstances in which the Trust itself would\nbe unable to meet its obligations. Given the\nabove limitations on shareholder personal\nliability, and the nature of each Fund\u2019s\nassets and operations, the risk to\nshareholders of personal liability is believed\nto be remote.\n\nShareholder inquiries may be made by writing\nto the Trust, c/o the Distributor, State\nStreet Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC\nat One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts\n02210.\n                                              \n     COUNSEL AND INDEPENDENT REGISTERED       \n     PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM                   \n                                              \nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, 1111 Pennsylvania\nAvenue NW, Washington, DC 20004, serves as\ncounsel to the Trust.

We            \n              understand that regulatory      \n              requirements and investor       \n              expectations relating to        \n              governance practices and        \n              engagement activities differ    \n              from country to country. As a   \n              result, we engage with          \n              issuers, regulators, or a       \n              combination of the two          \n              depending upon the market. We   \n              are also a member of various    \n              investor associations that      \n              seek to address broader         \n              corporate governance-related    \n              policy at the country level,    \n              as well as issuer-specific      \n              concerns at a company level.    \n              The State Street Global         \n              Advisors Asset Stewardship      \n              Team may collaborate with       \n              members of the Active           \n              Fundamental and various other   \n              investment teams to engage      \n              with companies on corporate     \n              governance issues and to        \n              address any specific concerns.  \n              This facilitates our            \n              comprehensive approach to       \n              information gathering as it     \n              relates to shareholder items    \n              that are to be voted upon at    \n              upcoming shareholder meetings.  \n              We also conduct                 \n              issuer-specific engagements     \n              with companies, covering        \n              various corporate governance    \n              and sustainability-related      \n              topics outside of proxy         \n              season.                         \n              The Asset Stewardship Team      \n              employs a blend of              \n              quantitative and qualitative    \n              research, analysis and data in  \n              order to support screens that   \n              identify issuers where active   \n              engagement may be necessary to  \n              protect and promote             \n              shareholder value. Issuer       \n              engagement may also be event    \n              driven, focusing on             \n              issuer-specific corporate       \n              governance, sustainability      \n              concerns, or more broad         \n              industry-related trends. We     \n              also consider the size of our   \n              total position of the issuer    \n              in question and/or the          \n              potential negative governance,  \n              performance profile, and        \n              circumstance at hand. As a      \n              result, we believe issuer       \n              engagement can take many forms  \n              and be triggered by numerous    \n              circumstances. The following    \n              approaches represent how we     \n              define engagement methods:      \n              We use screening tools          \n              designed to capture a mix of    \n              company-specific data,          \n  Active      including governance and        \n              sustainability profiles, to     \n              help us focus our voting and    \n              engagement activity.            \n              We will actively seek direct    \n              dialogue with the board and     \n              management of companies that    \n              we have identified through our  \n              screening processes. Such       \n              engagements may lead to         \n              further monitoring to ensure    \n              that the company improves its   \n              governance or sustainability    \n              practices. In these cases, the  \n              engagement process represents   \n              the most meaningful             \n              opportunity for us to protect   \n              long-term shareholder value     \n              from excessive risk due to      \n              poor governance and             \n              sustainability practices.       \n              Reactive engagement is          \n              initiated by the issuers. We    \n              routinely discuss specific      \n              voting issues and items with    \n  Reactive    the issuer community. Reactive  \n              engagement is an opportunity    \n              to address not only voting      \n              items, but also a wide range    \n              of governance and               \n              sustainability issues.          \n              We have established an          \n              engagement protocol that        \n              further describes our approach  \n              to issuer engagement.           \n                                              \n                     B-3                      \n                                              \n                        Assessing the         \n                        effectiveness of our  \n                        issuer engagement     \n                        process is often      \n                        difficult. In order   \n                        to limit the          \n                        subjectivity of       \n                        effectiveness         \n                        measurement, we       \n                        actively seek issuer  \n                        feedback and monitor  \n                        the actions issuers   \n                        take post-engagement  \n                        in order to identify  \n                        tangible changes.     \n                        Thus, we are able to  \n                        establish indicators  \n  Measurement           to gauge how issuers  \n                        respond to our        \n                        concerns and to what  \n                        degree these          \n                        responses satisfy     \n                        our requests.

Further, good     \n  corporate                                   \n  governance necessitates the existence of    \n  effective                                   \n  internal controls and risk management       \n  systems,                                    \n  which should be governed by the board.      \n  State Street Global Advisors believes that  \n  a well                                      \n  constituted board of directors with a good  \n  balance                                     \n  of skills, expertise, and independence      \n  provides                                    \n  the foundations for a well governed         \n  company. We                                 \n  view board quality as a measure of          \n  director                                    \n  independence, director succession           \n  planning, board                             \n  diversity, evaluations and refreshment,     \n  and                                         \n  company governance practices. We vote for   \n  the                                         \n  (re-)election of directors on a             \n  case-by-case basis                          \n  after considering various factors           \n  including board                             \n  quality, general market practice, and       \n  availability                                \n  of information on director skills and       \n  expertise.                                  \n  In our analysis of boards, we consider      \n  whether                                     \n  board members have adequate skills to       \n  provide                                     \n  effective oversight of corporate strategy,  \n  operations, and risks, including            \n  environmental and                           \n  social issues. Boards should also have a    \n  regular                                     \n  evaluation process in place to assess the   \n  effectiveness of the board and the skills   \n  of board                                    \n  members to address issues, such as          \n  emerging risks,                             \n  changes to corporate strategy, and          \n  diversification                             \n  of operations and geographic footprint.     \n  We may also consider board performance and  \n  directors who appear to be remiss in the    \n  performance of their oversight              \n  responsibilities                            \n  when analyzing their suitability for        \n  reappointment                               \n  (e.g. fraud, criminal wrongdoing and        \n  breach of                                   \n  fiduciary responsibilities).                \n  Board Independence                          \n  In principle, we believe independent        \n  directors are                               \n  crucial to corporate governance and help    \n  management establish sound ESG policies     \n  and                                         \n  practices. A sufficiently independent       \n  board will                                  \n  most effectively monitor management and     \n  perform                                     \n  oversight functions necessary to protect    \n  shareholder interests. We expect boards of  \n  ASX 300                                     \n  and New Zealand listed companies to be      \n  comprised                                   \n  of at least a majority of independent       \n  directors.                                  \n  At all other Australian listed companies,   \n  we                                          \n  expect boards to be comprised of at least   \n  one-third independent directors.            \n  Our broad criteria for director             \n  independence in                             \n  Australia and New Zealand include factors   \n  such as:                                    \n  \u2022 Participation in related-party            \n  transactions and                            \n  other business relations with the company   \n  \u2022\u2003\u2002\u200aEmployment history with company         \n  \u2022\u2003\u2002\u200aRelations with controlling              \n  shareholders                                \n  Family ties with any of the company\u2019s       \n  advisers,                                   \n  directors, or senior employees              \n  While we are generally supportive of        \n  having the                                  \n  roles of chairman and CEO separated in the  \n  Australian and New Zealand markets, we      \n  assess the                                  \n  division of responsibilities between        \n  chairman and                                \n  CEO on a case-by-case basis, giving         \n  consideration                               \n  to factors such as company-specific         \n  circumstances,                              \n  overall level of independence on the board  \n  and                                         \n  general corporate governance standards in   \n  the                                         \n  company.

We may    \n                  oppose proposals to         \n                  increase the ceiling if     \n                  there has been corporate    \n                  malfeasance or sustained    \n                  poor performance.           \n                  Annual Bonuses for          \n                  Directors/Statutory         \n                  Auditors                    \n                  In Japan, since there are   \n                  no legal requirements that  \n                  mandate companies to seek   \n                  shareholder approval        \n                  before awarding a bonus,    \n                  we believe that existing    \n                  shareholder approval of     \n                  the bonus should be         \n                  considered best practice.   \n                  As a result, we support     \n                  management proposals on     \n                  executive compensation      \n                  where there is a strong     \n                  relationship between        \n                  executive pay and           \n                  performance over a          \n                  five-year period.           \n                  Retirement Bonuses for      \n                  Directors/Statutory         \n                  Auditors                    \n                  Retirement bonuses make up  \n                  a sizeable portion of       \n                  directors\u2019 and auditors\u2019    \n                  lifetime compensation and   \n                  are based upon board        \n                  tenure. While many          \n                  companies in Japan have     \n                  abolished this practice,    \n                  there remain many           \n                  proposals seeking           \n                  shareholder approval for    \n                  the total amounts paid to   \n                  directors and statutory     \n                  auditors as a whole. In     \n                  general, we support these   \n                  payments unless the         \n                  recipient is an outsider    \n                  or in instances where the   \n                  amount is not disclosed.    \n                                              \n                     B-48                     \n                                              \n                         Stock Plans          \n                         Most option plans    \n                         in Japan are         \n                         conservative,        \n                         particularly at      \n                         large companies.     \n                         Japanese corporate   \n                         law requires         \n                         companies to         \n                         disclose the         \n                         monetary value of    \n                         the stock options    \n                         for directors        \n                         and/or statutory     \n                         auditors.

The                              \n  audit committee is responsible for          \n  monitoring the                              \n  integrity of the financial statements of    \n  the                                         \n  company, the appointment of external        \n  auditors,                                   \n  auditor qualifications and independence,    \n  and                                         \n  effectiveness and resource levels.          \n  Similarly,                                  \n  executive pay is an important aspect of     \n  corporate                                   \n  governance, and it should be determined by  \n  the                                         \n  board of directors. We expect companies to  \n  have                                        \n  remuneration committees to provide          \n  independent                                 \n  oversight over executive pay.

Boards     \n  should                                      \n  also have a regular evaluation process in   \n  place to                                    \n  assess the effectiveness of the board and   \n  the                                         \n  skills of board members to address issues   \n  such as                                     \n  emerging risks, changes to corporate        \n  strategy, and                               \n  diversification of operations and           \n  geographic                                  \n  footprint. The nomination committee is      \n  responsible                                 \n  for evaluating and reviewing the balance    \n  of                                          \n  skills, knowledge, and experience of the    \n  board. It                                   \n  also ensures that adequate succession       \n  plans are in                                \n  place for directors and the CEO. We may     \n  vote                                        \n  against the re-election of members of the   \n  nomination committee if, over time, the     \n  board has                                   \n  failed to address concerns over board       \n  structure or                                \n  succession.                                 \n  Poorly structured executive compensation    \n  plans                                       \n  pose increasing reputational risk to        \n  companies.                                  \n  Ongoing high level of dissent against a     \n  company\u2019s                                   \n  compensation proposals may indicate that    \n  the                                         \n  company is not receptive to investor        \n  concerns.

Hybrid securities may also be    \n  *  subject to contractually allowable       \n     write-downs of principal that could      \n     result in impairment. Together with the  \n     hybrid indicator, the long-term          \n     obligation rating assigned to a hybrid   \n     security is an expression of the         \n     relative credit risk associated with     \n     that security.                           \n                                              \nFitch Ratings Ltd.\u2019s (\u201cFitch\u201d) Corporate\nFinance Obligations \u2013 Long-Term Ratings:\n\nAAA: Highest Credit Quality. \u2018AAA\u2019 ratings\ndenote the lowest expectation of credit risk.\nThey are assigned only in cases of\nexceptionally strong capacity for payment of\nfinancial commitments.

Indemnification  \n                             \nPursuant to Section 5.3 of the Registrant\u2019s\nAmended and Restated Declaration of Trust and\nunder Section 4.9 of the Registrant\u2019s By-Laws,\nthe Trust will indemnify any person who is, or\nhas been, a Trustee, officer, employee or\nagent of the Trust against all expenses\nreasonably incurred or paid by him/her in\nconnection with any claim, action, suit or\nproceeding in which he/she becomes involved as\na party or otherwise by virtue of his/her\nbeing or having been a Trustee, officer,\nemployee or agent and against amounts paid or\nincurred by him/her in the settlement thereof,\nif he/she acted in good faith and in a manner\nhe/she reasonably believed to be in or not\nopposed to the best interests of the Trust,\nand, with respect to any criminal action or\nproceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe\nhis/her conduct was unlawful. In addition,\nindemnification is permitted only if it is\ndetermined that the actions in question did\nnot render him/her liable by reason of willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in\nthe performance of his/her duties or by reason\nof reckless disregard of his/her obligations\nand duties to the Registrant. The Registrant\nmay also advance money for litigation expenses\nprovided that Trustees, officers, employees\nand/or agents give their undertakings to repay\nthe Registrant unless their conduct is later\ndetermined to permit indemnification.\n\nPursuant to Section 5.2 of the Registrant\u2019s\nAmended and Restated Declaration of Trust, no\nTrustee, officer, employee or agent of the\nRegistrant shall be liable for any action or\nfailure to act, except in the case of willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence or\nreckless disregard of duties to the\nRegistrant. Pursuant to paragraph 9 of the\nRegistrant\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement,\nthe Adviser shall not be liable for any action\nor failure to act, except in the case of\nwillful misfeasance, bad faith or gross\nnegligence or reckless disregard of duties to\nthe Registrant.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liability\narising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the\n\u201cAct\u201d) may be permitted to directors, officers\nand controlling persons of the Registrant\npursuant to the provisions of Rule 484 under\nthe Act, or otherwise, the Registrant has been\nadvised that in the opinion of the SEC such\nindemnification is against public policy as\nexpressed in the Act and is, therefore,\nunenforceable. In the event that a claim for\nindemnification against such liabilities\n(other than the payment by the Registrant of\nexpenses incurred or paid by a director,\nofficer or controlling person of the\nRegistrant in the successful defense of any\naction, suit or proceeding) is asserted by\nsuch director, officer or controlling person\nin connection with the securities being\nregistered, the Registrant will, unless in the\nopinion of its counsel the matter has been\nsettled by controlling precedent, submit to a\ncourt of appropriate jurisdiction the question\nwhether such indemnification by it is against\npublic policy as expressed in the Act and will\nbe governed by the final adjudication of such\nissue.\n\nThe Registrant hereby undertakes that it will\napply the indemnification provision of its By-\nLaws in a manner consistent with Release 11330\nof the SEC under the Investment Company Act of\n1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), so long as\nthe interpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i)\nthereunder remains in effect.\n\nThe Registrant maintains insurance on behalf\nof any person who is or was a Trustee,\nofficer, employee or agent of the Registrant,\nor who is or was serving at the request of the\nRegistrant as a trustee, director, officer,\nemployee or agent of another trust or\ncorporation, against any liability asserted\nagainst him/her and incurred by him/her or\narising out of his/her position. However, in\nno event will the Registrant maintain\ninsurance to indemnify any such person for any\nact for which the Registrant itself is not\npermitted to indemnify him/her.\n                      6                       \n                                              \n  Item\u00a031.
