A Fund\u2019s per\nshare NAV is\nthe value of one share of a Fund and is\ncalculated by dividing the value of total\nassets less total liabilities by the number of\nshares outstanding. The NAV return is based on\nthe NAV of a Fund and the market return is\nbased on the market price per\nshare of a Fund. The market price used to\ncalculate the market return is determined by\nusing the midpoint between the highest bid and\nthe lowest offer on the exchange on which the\nshares of a Fund are listed for trading, as of\nthe time that a\nFund\u2019s NAV is calculated. NAV and market\nreturns assume that dividends and capital gain\ndistributions have been reinvested in a Fund\nat NAV. Market returns do not include\nbrokerage commissions that may be payable on\nsecondary market\ntransactions. If brokerage commissions were\nincluded market returns would be lower.\n\nAn index is a statistical measure of a\nspecified financial\nmarket or sector. An index does not actually\nhold a portfolio of securities and therefore\ndoes not reflect deductions for fees or\nexpenses. In comparison, a Fund\u2019s performance\nis negatively impacted by these deductions.\nIndex returns reflect\nall items of income, gain and loss and the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\n\nThe Bloomberg EM Local Currency Government\nDiversified\nIndex is designed to measure the performance\nof the fixed-rate local currency sovereign\ndebt of emerging market countries. The index\nincludes government bonds issued by investment\ngrade and non-investment grade countries\noutside the United States,\nin local currencies, that have a remaining\nmaturity of one year or more and are rated\nB3/B-/B- or higher using the middle rating of\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc., Standard &\nPoor\u2019s Financial Services, LLC and Fitch Inc.,\nrespectively.\n\nThe Bloomberg Global Aggregate ex-USD\n>$1B: Corporate Bond Index is designed to be a\nbroad based measure of the global investment-\ngrade, fixed rate, fixed income corporate\nmarkets outside the United States. The index\nis part of the Bloomberg Global ex-USD\nAggregate Bond Index (the\n\u201cAggregate Index\u201d). The major components of\nthe Aggregate Index are the Pan-European\nAggregate and the Asian Pacific Aggregate\nIndices. The securities in the index must have\na $1 billion USD equivalent market\ncapitalization outstanding\nand at least 1 year remaining. Securities must\nbe fixed rate, although zero coupon bonds and\nstep-ups are permitted. Additionally,\nsecurities must be rated investmen grade\n(Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or better) using the middle\nrating from Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service, Inc., Fitch Inc.,or\nStandard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services, LLC.\nafter dropping the highest and lowest\navailable ratings. If only two agencies rate a\nsecurity, then the more conservative (lower)\nrating will be used. If\nonly one rating agency rates a security, then\nthat one rating will be used. Excluded from\nthe index are subordinated debts, convertible\nsecurities, floating-rate notes, fixed-rate\nperpetuals, warrants, inflation-linked bonds\nand structured notes.\nThe index is market capitalization weighted\nand the securities in the index are updated on\nthe last business day of each month.\n\nThe Bloomberg Global Treasury ex-US Capped\nIndex is\ndesigned to track the fixed-rate local\ncurrency sovereign debt of investment grade\ncountries outside the United States. The index\nincludes government bonds issued by investment\ngrade countries outside the United States, in\nlocal currencies, that\nhave a remaining maturity of one year or more\nand are rated investment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB-\nor higher using the middle rating of Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor\u2019s,\nInc. and Fitch Inc., respectively). The index\nis\ncalculated by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\nusing a modified \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d\nmethodology. This design ensures that each\nconstituent country within the index is\nrepresented in a proportion consistent with\nits percentage with\nrespect to the total market capitalization of\nthe index. The index is rebalanced on a\nmonthly basis.\n\nThe Bloomberg 1-3 Year Global Treasury ex-US\nCapped Index\nis designed to measure the performance of\nfixed-rate local currency sovereign debt of\ninvestment grade countries outside the United\nStates that have remaining maturities of one\nto three years. The index includes government\nbonds issued by investment\ngrade countries outside the United States, in\nlocal currencies, that have remaining\nmaturities of one to three years and are rated\ninvestment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or higher\nusing the middle rating of Moody\u2019s Investors\nService, Inc., Standard\n& Poor\u2019s, Inc. and Fitch Inc., respectively).\nThe securities in the index must be fixed-rate\nand have certain minimum amounts outstanding,\ndepending upon the currency in which the bonds\nare denominated. The index is calculated by\nBloomberg\nIndex Services Limited using a modified\n\u201cmarket capitalization\u201d methodology. This\ndesign ensures that each constituent country\nwithin the index is represented in a\nproportion consistent with its percentage with\nrespect to the total\nmarket capitalization of the index. Component\nsecurities in each constituent country are\nrepresented in a proportion consistent with\ntheir percentage relative to the other\ncomponent securities in the constituent\ncountry. The securities in the index\nare updated monthly, on the last business day\nof each month.\n\nThe FTSE International Inflation-Linked\nSecurities Select\nIndex is designed to measure the total return\nperformance of inflation-linked bonds outside\nthe United States with fixed-rate coupon\npayments that are linked to an inflation\nindex. Inflation-protected public obligations\nof the inflation-linked\ngovernment bond markets of developed and\nemerging market countries, commonly known in\nthe United States as TIPS, are securities\nissued by such governments that are designed\nto provide inflation protection to investors.\nThe index includes government\ndebt (direct obligations of the issuer\ncountry) but does not include quasi-government\ndebt or corporate debt.\nSee accompanying notes to financial           \nstatements.                                   \n                      1                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \n    SPDR                                      \n    BLOOMBERG EMERGING MARKETS LOCAL BOND     \n    ETF                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION                \n       OF FUND PERFORMANCE (UNAUDITED)        \n                                              \nThe SPDR Bloomberg\nEmerging Markets Local Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)\nseeks to provide investment results that,\nbefore fees and expenses, correspond generally\nto the price and yield performance of an index\nthat tracks the fixed-rate local currency\nsovereign debt\nof emerging market countries. The Fund\u2019s\nbenchmark is the Bloomberg EM Local Currency\nGovernment Diversified Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d).*\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December 31,\n2021 (the\n\u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total return for the\nFund was \u2013 9.74% and the Index was \u2013 9.32%.\nThe Fund and Index returns reflect the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing the Fund, including brokerage and\nadvisory expenses. The\nIndex is unmanaged and Index returns do not\nreflect fees and expenses of any kind, which\nwould have a negative impact on returns. Fees,\nexpenses, cash drag, tax withholdings and\nsampling contributed to the difference between\nthe Fund\u2019s\nperformance and that of the Index.\n\nOngoing\nrepercussions from the COVID-19 pandemic and\npolicy action were the primary drivers of Fund\nperformance during the Reporting Period. The\nFund performed in line with expectations. The\nCOVID-19 virus continued to surge throughout\n2021 with multiple\nnew variants constraining the global recovery.\nThough many countries experienced strong\ngrowth in the beginning of the year\nespecially, as the year progressed growth was\nhampered by continued supply chain issues and\nlabor shortages. Inflation was a\nconcern around the world and central banks\nbegan to diverge in their future plans to\ncombat overheated economies. As a riskier\nsegment of the fixed income market EM was\nnegatively impacted throughout the year amid\ninvestor concerns surrounding virus\nresurgence, inflation and global growth. Local\ndebt, especially, was adversely impacted by\nrising yields and weaker currencies. EM\nsecurities sold off throughout the year \u2013 the\nFund began the year at a NAV of $28.00 and\nended the year at\n$24.37.\nThe Fund used forwards to manage currency     \nexposure during the Reporting Period. The use \nof forwards helped the Fund track the Index.  \nThe views expressed above reflect those of the\nFund\u2019s\nportfolio manager only through the Reporting\nPeriod and do not necessarily represent the\nviews of the Adviser as a whole. Any such\nviews are subject to change at any time based\nupon market or other conditions and the\nAdviser disclaims any\nresponsibility to update such views. These\nviews may not be relied on as investment\nadvice and, because investment decisions for a\nfund are based on numerous factors, may not be\nrelied on as an indication of trading intent\non behalf of any\nfund.\n*Effective November 1, 2021, Barclays was     \nremoved                                       \nfrom both the Fund and Index name. The        \nprincipal investment strategy of the Fund did \nnot change due to the name change.            \n                                              \nSee accompanying notes to financial           \nstatements.                                   \n                      2                       \nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF\nPerformance Summary (Unaudited) Performance as\nof December 31, 2021\n                                              \n             Cum\u2026                Ave\u2026         \n             Tot\u2026                Ann\u2026         \n             Ret\u2026                Tot\u2026         \n                                 Ret\u2026         \n                   Blo\u2026                Bloo\u2026  \n                   EM                  EM     \n       Net   Mar\u2026  Loc\u2026    Net   Mar\u2026  Local  \n       Ass\u2026  Val\u2026  Cur\u2026    Ass\u2026  Val\u2026  Curr\u2026  \n       Val\u2026        Gov\u2026    Val\u2026        Gove\u2026  \n                   Div\u2026                Dive\u2026  \n                   Ind\u2026                Index  \n  ONE  (9.\u2026  (9.\u2026  (9.\u2026    (9.\u2026  (9.\u2026  (9.3\u2026  \n  YE\u2026                                         \n  FI\u2026  10.\u2026  11.\u2026  14.\u2026    2.0\u2026  2.1\u2026  2.71%  \n  YE\u2026                                         \n  TEN  8.3\u2026  7.3\u2026  16.\u2026    0.8\u2026  0.7\u2026  1.56%  \n  YE\u2026                                         \n                                              \nComparison of Change in Value of a $10,000\nInvestment\n(Based on Net Asset Value) Line graph is based\non cumulative total return.

The\nFund\u2019s benchmark is the Bloomberg 1-3 Year\nGlobal Treasury ex-US Capped Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d). *\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December 31,\n2021 (the\n\u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total return for the\nFund was \u2013 6.91% and the Index was \u2013 6.55%.\nThe Fund and Index returns reflect the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing the Fund, including brokerage and\nadvisory expenses. The\nIndex is unmanaged and Index returns do not\nreflect fees and expenses of any kind, which\nwould have a negative impact on returns. Fees,\nexpenses, cash drag, tax withholdings and\nsampling contributed to the difference between\nthe Fund\u2019s\nperformance and that of the Index.\n\nOngoing\nrepercussions from the COVID-19 pandemic and\npolicy action were the primary drivers of Fund\nperformance during the Reporting Period. The\nFund performed in line with expectations. The\nCOVID-19 virus continued to surge throughout\n2021 with multiple\nnew variants constraining the global recovery.\nThough many countries experienced strong\ngrowth in the beginning of the year\nespecially, as the year progressed growth was\nhampered by continued supply chain issues and\nlabor shortages. Inflation was a\nconcern around the world and central banks\nbegan to diverge in their future plans to\ncombat overheated economies. While the Bank of\nJapan favors further fiscal stimulus, the\nEuropean Central Bank proved more hawkish,\nannouncing at their December\nmeeting that purchases under their Pandemic\nEmergency Purchase Program would end in March.\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England surprised\nmarkets by raising the Bank Rate by 15 bps to\n0.25%, marking the first rate hike since\nAugust 2018.\n\nInternational Treasury securities sold off\nthroughout the\nyear \u2013 the Fund began the year at a NAV of\n$32.84 and ended the year at $30.38. On a\ncountry specific level, the top positive\ncontributors to the Fund\u2019s performance during\nthe Reporting Period were China, Israel and\nIndonesia government\nbonds. The top negative contributors to the\nFund\u2019s performance during the Reporting Period\nwere Chile, Colombia and Peru government\nbonds.\nThe Fund did not invest in derivatives during \nthe Reporting                                 \nPeriod.                                       \nThe views expressed above reflect those of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio manager only through the\nReporting Period and do not necessarily\nrepresent the views of the Adviser as a whole.\nAny such views are subject to change at any\ntime based upon market or other conditions and\nthe Adviser\ndisclaims any responsibility to update such\nviews.

The Fund\u2019s benchmark is\nFTSE International Inflation-Linked Securities\nSelect Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d).\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December 31,\n2021 (the\n\u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total return for the\nFund was \u2013 3.68% and the Index was \u2013 3.10%.\nThe Fund and Index returns reflect the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing the Fund, including brokerage and\nadvisory expenses. The\nIndex is unmanaged and Index returns do not\nreflect fees and expenses of any kind, which\nwould have a negative impact on returns. Fees,\nexpenses, cash drag, tax withholdings and\nsampling contributed to the difference between\nthe Fund\u2019s\nperformance and that of the index.\n\nOngoing\nrepercussions from the COVID-19 pandemic and\npolicy action were the primary drivers of Fund\nperformance during the Reporting Period. The\nFund performed in line with expectations. The\nCOVID-19 virus continued to surge throughout\n2021 with multiple\nnew variants constraining the global recovery.\nThough many countries experienced strong\ngrowth in the beginning of the year\nespecially, as the year progressed growth was\nhampered by continued supply chain issues and\nlabor shortages. Inflation was a\nconcern around the world and central banks\nbegan to diverge in their future plans to\ncombat overheated economies. While the Bank of\nJapan favors further fiscal stimulus, the\nEuropean Central Bank proved more hawkish,\nannouncing at their December\nmeeting that purchases under their Pandemic\nEmergency Purchase Program would end in March.\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England surprised\nmarkets by raising the Bank Rate by 15 bps to\n0.25%, marking the first rate hike since\nAugust 2018.\n\nInternational Inflation-Protected Treasury\nsecurities sold\noff throughout the year \u2013 the Fund began the\nyear at a NAV of $58.71 and ended the year at\n$53.81. On a country specific level, the top\npositive contributors to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance during the Reporting Period were\nIsrael, South Africa\nand United Kingdom government bonds. The top\nnegative contributors to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance during the Reporting Period were\nChile, Colombia and Turkey government bonds.\nThe Fund did not invest in derivatives during \nthe Reporting                                 \nPeriod.                                       \nThe views expressed above reflect those of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio manager only through the\nReporting Period and do not necessarily\nrepresent the views of the Adviser as a whole.\nAny such views are subject to change at any\ntime based upon market or other conditions and\nthe Adviser\ndisclaims any responsibility to update such\nviews. These views may not be relied on as\ninvestment advice and, because investment\ndecisions for a fund are based on numerous\nfactors, may not be relied on as an indication\nof trading intent on behalf of\nany fund.\nSee accompanying notes to financial           \nstatements.                                   \n                      14                      \nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR FTSE International Government Inflation-\nProtected Bond ETF Performance Summary\n(Unaudited) Performance as of December 31,\n2021\n                                              \n             Cum\u2026                Aver\u2026        \n             Tot\u2026                Annu\u2026        \n             Ret\u2026                Total        \n                                 Retu\u2026        \n                   FTSE                 FTSE  \n       Net         Int\u2026    Net          Int\u2026  \n       Ass\u2026  Mar\u2026  Inf\u2026    Ass\u2026  Mark\u2026  Inf\u2026  \n       Val\u2026  Val\u2026  Sec\u2026    Val\u2026  Value  Sec\u2026  \n                   Sel\u2026                 Sel\u2026  \n                   Ind\u2026                 Ind\u2026  \n  ONE  (3.\u2026  (4.\u2026  (3.\u2026    (3.\u2026  (4.3\u2026  (3.\u2026  \n  YE\u2026                                         \n  FI\u2026                                         \n  YE\u2026  18.\u2026  18.\u2026  21.\u2026    3.4\u2026  3.53%  4.0\u2026  \n  (2)                                         \n  TEN                                         \n  YE\u2026  20.\u2026  20.\u2026  27.\u2026    1.9\u2026  1.88%  2.4\u2026  \n  (2)                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Effective                              \n       February 15, 2016, the Fund changed    \n       its benchmark index from the DB        \n       Global Government ex-US                \n       Inflation-Linked Securities Select     \n  (1)  Index.

\n       Per share                              \n       numbers have been calculated using     \n  (b)  average shares outstanding, which      \n       more appropriately presents the per    \n

in aggregate gains and losses   \n  (c)  in securities for the fiscal period    \n       because of the timing of sales and     \n       repurchases of Fund shares in          \n       relation to

at net     \n       asset value on the last day of each    \n       period reported. Distributions are     \n  (e)  assumed, for the purpose of this       \n       calculation, to be reinvested at net   \n       asset value per share on the           \n       respective payment dates of each       \n       distribution. Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized. Broker commission charges  \n       are not included in this calculation.  \n       If an                                  \n       affiliate had not made a contribution  \n  (f)  during the year ended December 31,     \n       2020, the total return would have      \n       remained 9.73%.                        \n  (g)  Annualized.                            \n       Portfolio

Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies The following is a summary of\nsignificant accounting policies followed by\nthe Trust in the preparation of its financial\nstatements: The preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d)\nrequires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts\nand disclosures in the financial statements.\nActual results could differ from those\nestimates. Each Fund is an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and\nreporting guidance applicable to investment\ncompanies. Security Valuation Each Fund's\ninvestments are valued at fair value each day\nthat the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) is\nopen and, for financial reporting purposes, as\nof the report date should the reporting period\nend on a day that the NYSE is not open. Fair\nvalue is generally defined as the price a fund\nwould receive to sell an asset or pay to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. By its nature, a fair value price is a\ngood faith estimate of the valuation in a\ncurrent sale and may not reflect an actual\nmarket price. The investments of each Fund are\nvalued pursuant to the policy and procedures\ndeveloped by the Oversight Committee (the\n\u201cCommittee\u201d) and approved by the Board. The\nCommittee provides oversight of the valuation\nof investments for the Funds. The Board has\nresponsibility for overseeing the\ndetermination of the fair value of\ninvestments. Valuation techniques used to\nvalue each Fund\u2019s investments by major\ncategory are as follows: \u2022 Investments in\nregistered investment companies (including\nmoney market funds) or other unitized pooled\ninvestment vehicles that are not traded on an\nexchange are valued at that day\u2019s published\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share or unit. \u2022\nGovernment and municipal fixed income\nsecurities are generally valued using\nquotations from independent pricing services\nor brokers. Certain government inflation-\nindexed securities may require a calculated\nfair valuation as the cumulative inflation is\ncontained within the price provided by the\npricing service or broker. For these\nsecurities, the inflation component of the\nprice is \u201ccleaned\u201d from the pricing service or\nbroker price utilizing the published inflation\nfactors in order to ensure proper accrual of\nincome. \u2022 Debt obligations (including short-\nterm investments and convertible debt\nsecurities) are valued using quotations from\nindependent pricing services or brokers or are\ngenerally valued at the last reported\nevaluated prices. \u2022 Forward foreign currency\nexchange contracts are valued based on that\nday\u2019s prevailing forward exchange rate for the\nunderlying currencies. The rates are obtained\nfrom independent pricing services in\naccordance with the\n\n85\nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \n  SPDR SERIES                                 \n  TRUST                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(continued)    \n                                              \n                                              \n  December 31, 2021                           \n                                              \nvaluation policy and procedures approved by   \nthe                                           \nBoard.                                        \n                                              \nIn the event prices or quotations are not     \nreadily                                       \navailable or that the application of these    \nvaluation methods results in a price for an   \ninvestment that is deemed to be not           \nrepresentative of the fair value of such      \ninvestment, fair value will be determined in  \ngood faith by the Committee, in               \naccordance with the valuation policy and      \nprocedures approved by the Board.             \n                                              \nVarious inputs are used in determining the    \nvalue of the Funds'                           \ninvestments.                                  \n                                              \nThe Funds value their assets and              \nliabilities at fair value using a fair value  \nhierarchy consisting of three broad levels    \nthat prioritize the inputs to valuation       \ntechniques giving the highest priority to     \nreadily available unadjusted quoted prices in \nactive markets for identical                  \nassets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)  \nand the lowest priority to unobservable inputs\n(Level 3 measurements) when market prices are \nnot readily available or reliable.

The contract\nis marked-to-market daily and the change in\nmarket value is recorded by the Fund as an\nunrealized gain or loss. When the contract is\nclosed, a Fund recognizes a realized gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the value\nof the contract at the time it was opened and\nthe value at the time it was closed. Certain\nrisks may arise upon entering into forward\nforeign currency exchange contracts from the\npotential inability of counterparties to meet\nthe terms of their contracts and are generally\nlimited to the amount of unrealized gains on\nappreciated contracts, if any. Additionally,\nwhen utilizing forward foreign currency\nexchange contracts to hedge, the Funds give up\nthe opportunity to profit from favorable\nexchange rate movements during the term of the\ncontract.

Each Fund will not be subject to federal\nincome taxes to the extent it distributes its\ntaxable income, including any net realized\ncapital gains, for each fiscal year.\nTherefore, no provision for federal income tax\nis required.\n\n90\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST NOTES TO\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) December 31,\n2021\n\nThe Funds file federal and various state and\nlocal tax returns as required. No income tax\nreturns are currently under examination.\nGenerally, the federal returns are subject to\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service\nfor a period of three years from date of\nfiling, while the state returns may remain\nopen for an additional year depending upon\njurisdiction. SSGA FM has analyzed each Fund's\ntax positions taken on tax returns for all\nopen years and does not believe there are any\nuncertain tax positions that would require\nrecognition of a tax liability. Distributions\nto shareholders are recorded on ex-dividend\ndate. Income dividends and gain distributions\nare determined in accordance with income tax\nrules and regulations, which may differ from\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\nCertain capital accounts in the financial\nstatements have been adjusted for permanent\nbook-tax differences. These adjustments have\nno impact on NAV or results of operations.\nTemporary book-tax differences will reverse in\nthe future. These book-tax differences are\nprimarily due to differing treatments for\ncharacter of distributions, in-kind\ntransactions, foreign currencies, premium\namortization, net operating losses, wash sale\nloss deferrals, TIPS adjustments, forward\ncontracts and distributions in excess of\ncurrent earnings. The tax character of\ndistributions paid during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, was as follows:\n                                              \n                   Long-\u2026       Tax

Securities Lending Each Fund may lend\nsecurities to qualified broker-dealers or\ninstitutional investors. The loans are secured\nat all times by cash, cash equivalents or U.S.\ngovernment securities in an amount at least\nequal to the market value of the securities\nloaned, plus accrued interest and dividends,\ndetermined on a daily basis and adjusted\naccordingly. The value of the collateral with\nrespect to a loaned security may be\ntemporarily more or less than the value of a\nsecurity due to market fluctuations of\nsecurities values. With respect to each loan,\nif on any U.S. business day the aggregate\nmarket value of securities collateral plus\ncash collateral is less than the aggregate\nmarket value of the securities which are\nsubject to the loan, the borrower will be\nnotified to provide additional collateral on\nthe next business day. The Funds will regain\nrecord ownership of loaned securities to\nexercise certain beneficial rights; however,\nthe Funds may bear the risk of delay in\nrecovery of, or even loss of rights in the\nsecurities loaned should the borrower fail\nfinancially. In addition, a Fund will bear the\nrisk of loss of any cash collateral that it\nmay invest. Each Fund receives compensation\nfor lending its securities from interest or\ndividends earned on the cash, cash equivalents\nor U.S. government securities held as\ncollateral, net of fee rebates paid to the\nborrower and net of fees paid to State Street\nas the lending agent. Additionally, a Fund\nwill receive a fee from the borrower for non-\ncash collateral equal to a percentage of the\nmarket value of the loaned securities. The\nmarket value of securities on loan as of\nDecember 31, 2021, and the value of the\ninvested cash collateral are disclosed in the\nFunds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nNon-cash collateral is not disclosed in the\nFunds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities as\nit is held by the lending agent on behalf of\nthe Funds and the Funds do not have the\nability to re-hypothecate those securities.\nSecurities lending income, as disclosed in the\nFunds' Statements of Operations, represents\nthe income earned from the non-cash collateral\nand the investment of cash collateral, net of\nfee rebates paid to the borrower and net of\nfees paid to State Street as lending agent.\nThe following is a summary of each Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agreements and related cash\nand

In response to concerns  \nabout structural risks of interbank offered   \nrates, and particularly the risk of           \ncessation of LIBOR, regulators have undertaken\nreference rate reform initiatives to identify \nalternative reference rates that are more     \nobservable or transaction based and less      \nsusceptible to manipulation. ASU 2020-04      \nprovides optional guidance for a              \nlimited period of time to ease the potential  \nburden in accounting for (or recognizing the  \neffects of) reference rate reform on financial\nreporting. ASU 2020-04 is elective and applies\nto all entities, subject to meeting certain   \ncriteria, that have                           \ncontracts, hedging relationships, and other   \ntransactions that reference LIBOR or another  \nreference rate expected to be discontinued    \nbecause of reference rate reform. The relief  \nprovided is temporary and generally cannot be \napplied to contract                           \nmodifications that occur after December 31,   \n2022, or hedging relationships entered into or\nevaluated after that date. However, the FASB  \nhas indicated that it will revisit the sunset \ndate in Topic 848 after the LIBOR             \nadministrator makes a final                   \ndecision on a phaseout date. On November 30,  \n2020, the LIBOR administrator proposed        \nextending the publication of the overnight and\nthe one-, three-, six- and 12-month USD LIBOR \nsettings through June 30, 2023, when many     \nexisting contracts that                       \nreference LIBOR will have expired.

Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Funds\u2019 financial statements\nand financial highlights based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the\nTrust in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB. We conducted our\naudits in accordance with the standards of the\nPCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. The Trust is\nnot required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of the Trust\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. As part of\nour audits we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, but not for the purpose\nof expressing an opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Trust\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting. Accordingly, we express no such\nopinion. Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks.

This example is intended\nto help you understand your ongoing costs (in\ndollars) of investing in the Fund and to\ncompare these costs with the ongoing costs of\ninvesting in other mutual funds. It is based\non an investment of $1,000 made at the\nbeginning of the period shown and held for the\nentire period from July 1, 2021 to December\n31, 2021. The table below illustrates your\nFund\u2019s cost in two ways: Based on actual fund\nreturn \u2014\u2014This section helps you to estimate\nthe actual expenses that you paid over the\nperiod. The \u201cEnding Account Value\u201d shown is\nderived from each Fund's actual return, and\nthe third column shows the dollar amount that\nwould have been paid by an investor who\nstarted with $1,000 in each Fund. You may use\nthe information here, together with the amount\nyou invested, to estimate the expenses that\nyou paid over the period. To do so, simply\ndivide your account value by $1,000 (for\nexample, an $8,600 account value divided by\n$1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the\nnumber given for the Fund under the heading\n\u201cExpenses Paid During Period\u201d. Based on\nhypothetical 5% return \u2014\u2014This section is\nintended to help you compare your Fund\u2019s costs\nwith those of other mutual funds. It assumes\nthat the Fund had a yearly return of 5% before\nexpenses, but that the expense ratio is\nunchanged. In this case, because the return\nused is not the Fund\u2019s actual return, the\nresults do not apply to your investment. The\nexample is useful in making comparisons\nbecause the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) requires all mutual\nfunds to calculate expenses based on a 5%\nreturn. You can assess your Fund\u2019s costs by\ncomparing this hypothetical example with the\nhypothetical examples that appear in\nshareholder reports of other funds. Please\nnote that the expenses shown in the table are\nmeant to highlight your ongoing costs only and\ndo not reflect any transaction costs, such as\nsales load charges (loads). Therefore, the\nhypothetical 5% return section of the table is\nuseful in comparing ongoing costs only, and\nwill not help you determine the relative total\ncosts of owning different funds. In addition,\nif these transaction costs were included, your\ncosts would have been higher.\n                                              \n                                   Hyp\u2026       \n                                   (as\u2026       \n                  Ac\u2026              a 5%       \n                                   ret\u2026       \n                                   bef\u2026       \n                                   exp\u2026       \n      An\u2026    En\u2026       Ex\u2026    En\u2026        Ex\u2026  \n      Ex\u2026    Ac\u2026       Pa\u2026    Ac\u2026        Pa\u2026  \n      Ra\u2026    Va\u2026       Du\u2026    Va\u2026        Du\u2026  \n                       Pe\u2026               Pe\u2026  \n  S\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026  0.\u2026    $9\u2026       $1\u2026    $1\u2026        $1\u2026  \n  L\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026  0.\u2026    95\u2026       2.\u2026    1,\u2026        2.\u2026  \n  C\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026  0.\u2026    96\u2026       1.\u2026    1,\u2026        1.\u2026  \n  T\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026  0.\u2026    96\u2026       1.\u2026    1,\u2026        1.\u2026  \n  I\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026                                          \n  G\u2026  0.\u2026    98\u2026       2.\u2026    1,\u2026        2.\u2026  \n  I\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Expenses are equal to the              \n       Fund's annualized net expense ratio    \n  (a)  multiplied by the average account      \n       value of the period, multiplied by     \n       184, then divided by 365.              \n                                              \n97\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST OTHER\nINFORMATION (continued) December 31, 2021\n(Unaudited)\n\nTax Information For federal income tax\npurposes, the following information is\nfurnished with respect to the distributions of\nthe Funds for their fiscal year ended December\n31, 2021.
