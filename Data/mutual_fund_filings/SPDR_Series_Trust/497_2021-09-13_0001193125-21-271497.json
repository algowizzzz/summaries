Prospectus is updated to: (i)replace    \n      the existing\u201cPreferred Securities       \n      Risk\u201ddiscussion with the corresponding  \n      discussion below and (ii)add the\u201cDebt   \n      Securities Risk\u201ddiscussion below.       \n                                              \nPreferred Securities Risk:Generally, Preferred\nSecurity holders have no or limited voting\nrights with respect to the issuing company. In\naddition, Preferred Securities are generally\nsenior to common stock, but subordinated to\nbonds and other debt instruments in a\ncompany\u2019s capital structure and therefore will\nbe subject to greater credit risk than those\ndebt instruments. In the event an issuer of\nPreferred Securities experiences economic\ndifficulties, the issuer\u2019s Preferred\nSecurities may lose substantial value due to\nthe increased likelihood of deferred interest\nor dividend payments and the fact that the\nPreferred Security may be subordinated to\nother securities of the same issuer. Further,\nbecause many Preferred Securities pay interest\nor dividends at a fixed rate, their market\nprice can be sensitive to changes in interest\nrates in a manner similar to bonds \u2014 that is,\nas interest rates rise, the value of the\nPreferred Securities held by the Fund are\nlikely to decline. In addition, to the extent\nPreferred Securities allow holders to convert\nthe Preferred Securities into common stock of\nthe issuer, their market price can be\nsensitive to changes in the value of the\nissuer\u2019s common stock and, therefore,\ndeclining common stock values may also cause\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s investments to\ndecline. Preferred securities often have call\nfeatures which allow the issuer to redeem the\nsecurity at its discretion. The redemption of\na Preferred Security having a higher than\naverage yield may cause a decrease in the\nFund\u2019s yield. Debt Securities Risk:The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of the\nFund\u2019s fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund\u2019s\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund\u2019s yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). If the principal on a\ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,\nthe prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by the\nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities.\n                                              \n      Effective immediately, the\u201cADDITIONAL   \n      RISK INFORMATION\u201dsection beginning on   \n      page 272 of the Prospectus is updated   \n      to:(i) replace the existing\u201cPreferred   \n      Securities Risk\u201ddiscussion with the     \n  2.  corresponding discussion below;         \n      (ii)add the\u201cDebt Securities             \n      Risk\u201ddiscussion below; and              \n      (iii)reflect in the risk chart          \n      that\u201cDebt Securities Risk\u201dis a          \n      principal risk of the Fund.             \n                                              \nPreferred Securities Risk.Generally, preferred\nsecurity holders have no or limited voting\nrights with respect to the issuing company.

Therefore, to the extent\nthat the Fund invests a substantial portion of\nits assets in fixed rate preferred securities,\nrising interest rates may cause the value of\nthe Fund\u2019s investments to decline\nsignificantly. In addition, to the extent\npreferred securities allow holders to convert\nthe preferred securities into common stock of\nthe issuer, their market price can be\nsensitive to changes in the value of the\nissuer\u2019s common stock and, therefore,\ndeclining common stock values may also cause\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s investments to\ndecline.
