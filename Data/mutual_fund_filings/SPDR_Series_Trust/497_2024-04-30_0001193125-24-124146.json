  "text": "SPDR \u00aeSeries Trust SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) Supplement dated April 30, 2024to the Prospectus and\nSummary Prospectus, each dated October 31, 2023, as may be supplemented from time to time Effective\nimmediately, the methodology for the S&P 500 ESG Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d) has been updated. Accordingly,\neffective immediately, \u201cTHE FUND\u2019S PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY\u201d section beginning on page 17 of the\nProspectus and page 1 of the Summary Prospectus is deleted and replaced with the following: In seeking to\ntrack the performance of the S&P 500 ESG Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which\nmeans that the Fund is not required to purchase all of the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities\nwith generally the same risk and return characteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund,\neither may invest the Fund\u2019s assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest the Fund\u2019s assets\nin substantially all of the securities represented in the Index in approximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its objective. The\nFund is classified as \u201cdiversified\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; however, the Fund\nmay become \u201cnon\u2011diversified\u201d solely as a result of tracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or\nmore component securities). When the Fund is non\u2011diversified, it may invest a relatively high percentage of\nits assets in a limited number of issuers. Under normal market conditions, the Fund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are not included in\nthe Index, cash and cash equivalents or money market instruments, such as repurchase agreements and money\nmarket funds (including money market funds advised by the Adviser). In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund\u2019s assets may be concentrated in an industry or group of industries, but only to the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the Index and in managing\ncash flows. The Index is designed to measure the performance of securities meeting certain sustainability\ncriteria (criteria related to ESG factors), while maintaining similar overall industry group weights as the\nS&P 500 Index. Securities eligible for inclusion in the Index comprise all constituents of the S&P 500 Index\nexcept for:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022    Companies that meet any of the following Business Involvement Exclusions, based on revenue levels    \n       as determined by S&P Global, Inc.

After implementing the exclusion criteria\ndescribed above, the remaining companies are then ranked based on their S&P Global ESG Score. For each GICS\nindustry group, companies are selected for inclusion in the Index primarily in decreasing order of S&P\nGlobal ESG Score until approximately 75% of the float adjusted market capitalization of the industry group\nis reached. The Index is float-adjusted market capitalization weighted. A company\u2019s float-adjusted market\ncapitalization is calculated by multiplying the number of shares readily available in the market by the\nprice of such shares. The Index is reconstituted and rebalanced annually on the last business day in April\nbased on information as of the last trading date in March. In addition, companies will be removed from the\nIndex (i) on the last business day of July, October and January, if found to meet a Business Involvement\nExclusion as of the last business day of the previous month, or (ii) on the third Friday of March, June,\nSeptember and December if found to be a Non\u2011Compliant UNGC Company as of the last business day of the\nprevious month. In addition, between Index rebalances, Index constituents may be removed from the Index for\ntheir involvement in economic crime and corruption, fraud, illegal commercial practices, human rights\nabuses, labor disputes, workplace safety catastrophic accidents, environmental disasters, and certain other\nactivities associated with environmental, social 2 and governance risks. Any companies removed from the\nIndex on account of such activities are not eligible for inclusion in the Index until one full calendar year\nfrom the next rebalancing of the Index. As of April 30, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund comprised\ncompanies in the technology sector, although this may change from time to time. As of April 30, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 324 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of the\nIndex, relative weightings of the securities in the Index and publishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Index.
