Coverage generally includes corporate actions for common equity holders, such\nas written consents and\nbankruptcies. ISS\u0092 U.S. coverage includes investment companies (including open-end funds, closed-end funds,\nexchange-traded funds, and unit investment trusts),\nlimited partnerships (\u0093LPs\u0094), master limited partnerships (\u0093MLPs\u0094), limited liability companies (\u0093LLCs\u0094),\nand business development companies. ISS reviews its universe of coverage on an annual basis, and the\ncoverage is\nsubject to change based on client need and industry trends.\n\nForeign-incorporated companies\n\nIn addition to U.S.- incorporated, U.S.- listed companies, ISS\u0092 U.S. policies are applied to certain\nforeign-incorporated company analyses. Like\nthe SEC, ISS distinguishes two types of companies that list but are not incorporated in the U.S.:\n                                                                                                            \n        U.S. Domestic Issuers \u0096 which have a majority of outstanding shares held in the U.S. and meet other  \n        criteria, as                                                                                        \n  \u25fe    determined by the SEC, and are subject to the same disclosure and listing standards as U.S.         \n        incorporated companies (e.g. they are required to file DEF14A proxy statements) \u0096 are generally      \n        covered under standard U.S. policy guidelines.                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Foreign Private Issuers (FPIs) \u0096 which are allowed to take exemptions from most                      \n  \u25fe    disclosure requirements (e.g., they are allowed to file 6-K for their proxy materials) and U.S.     \n        listing standards \u0096 are generally covered under a combination of policy guidelines:                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        FPI Guidelines (see the Americas Regional Proxy Voting Guidelines), may apply to                    \n  \u25fe    companies incorporated in governance havens, and apply certain minimum independence and disclosure  \n        standards in the evaluation of key proxy ballot items, such as the election of directors; and/or    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                         \n  \u25fe    Guidelines for the market that is responsible for, or most relevant to, the item on the ballot.  \n                                                                                                         \nU.S. incorporated companies listed only on non-U.S. exchanges are generally covered under the ISS guidelines\nfor\nthe market on which they are traded.\n\nAn FPI is generally covered under ISS\u0092 approach to FPIs outlined above, even if such FPI voluntarily\nfiles a proxy statement and/or other filing normally required of a U.S. Domestic Issuer, so long as the\ncompany retains its FPI status.\n\nIn all\ncases \u0096 including with respect to other companies with cross-market features that may lead to ballot items\nrelated to multiple markets \u0096 items that are on the ballot solely due to the requirements of another market\n(listing, incorporation,\nor national code) may be evaluated under the policy of the relevant market, regardless of the\n\n\u0093assigned\u0094 primary market coverage.\n                                                                     \n  W W W .

Board of Directors\n\nVoting on Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections\n\nFour fundamental principles apply when determining votes on director nominees:\n\nIndependence:Boards should be sufficiently independent from management (and significant shareholders) to\nensure that they are able and motivated to effectively supervise management\u0092s performance for the benefit of\nall shareholders, including in setting and monitoring the execution of corporate strategy, with appropriate\nuse of shareholder capital, and in setting and monitoring executive compensation programs that support that\nstrategy. The chair of the board should ideally be an independent director, and all boards should have an\nindependent leadership position or a similar role in order to help provide appropriate counterbalance to\nexecutive management, as well as having sufficiently independent committees that focus on key governance\nconcerns such as audit, compensation, and nomination of directors.\n\nComposition:Companies should ensure that directors add value to the board through their specific skills and\nexpertise and by having sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. Boards should be of a size\nappropriate to accommodate diversity, expertise, and independence, while ensuring active and collaborative\nparticipation by all members. Boards should be sufficiently diverse to ensure consideration of a wide range\nof perspectives.\n\nResponsiveness:Directors should respond to investor input, such as that expressed through significant\nopposition to management proposals, significant support for shareholder proposals (whether binding or non-\nbinding),and tender offers where a majority of shares are tendered.\n\nAccountability:Boards should be sufficiently accountable to shareholders, including through transparency of\nthe company\u0092s governance practices and regular board elections, by the provision of sufficient information\nfor shareholders to be able to assess directors and board composition, and through the ability of\nshareholders to remove directors.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for director nominees, except under the following circumstances (with\nnew nominees 1 considered on case-by-casebasis):\n\nIndependence\n\nVote againstor withhold from non-independentdirectors (Executive Directors and Non-Independent Non-\nExecutiveDirectors perISS\u0092 Classification of Directors) when:\n                                                                         \n  \u25fe    Independent directors comprise 50\u00a0percent or less of the board;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                                       \n  \u25fe    The non-independent director serves on the audit, compensation, or nominating  \n        committee;                                                                     \n                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so that the full board functions  \n        as that committee; or                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        The company lacks a formal nominating committee, even if the board attests that the independent     \n  \u25fe    directors fulfill the                                                                               \n        functions of such a committee.                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n1 A \u0093new nominee\u0094 is a director who is being presented for election by shareholders for the first time.\nRecommendations on new nominees who have served for less than one year are made on\na case-by-case basis depending on the timing of their appointment and the problematic governance issue in\nquestion.\n\n2 In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use \u0093Withhold\u0094 as the\ncontrary vote option in director elections; companies with a majority vote standard use \u0093Against\u0094.

Current interim officers\nare included in this category. For\nprivate companies, the equivalent positions are applicable. A non-employee director serving as an officer\ndue to statutory requirements (e.g. corporate secretary) will generally be classified as a Non-Independent\nNon-Executive Director under \u0093Any material relationship with the company.\u0094 However, if the company provides\nexplicit disclosure that the director is\nnot receiving additional compensation exceeding $10,000 per year for serving in that capacity, then the\ndirector will be classified as an Independent Director.\n\n2. \u0093Affiliate\u0094 includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. ISS uses 50 percent control\nownership by the parent\ncompany as the standard for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor of an externally managed\nissuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate.\n\n3. Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the company\u0092s initial public offering (IPO).\n\n4. When there is a former CEO of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) serving on the board of an\nacquired company, ISS will generally\nclassify such directors as independent unless determined otherwise taking into account the following\nfactors: the applicable listing standards determination of such director\u0092s independence; any operating ties\nto the firm; and the existence of\nany other conflicting relationships or related party transactions.\n\n5.ISS will look at the terms of the interim officer\u0092s\nemployment contract to determine if it contains severance pay, long-term health and pension benefits, or\nother such standard provisions typically contained in contracts of permanent, non-temporary CEOs. ISS\nwill also consider if a formal search process was under way for a full-time officer at the time.\n\n6.\u0093Immediate family\nmember\u0094 follows the SEC\u0092s definition of such and covers spouses, parents, children, step-parents, step-\nchildren, siblings, in-laws, and any person (other than\na tenant or employee) sharing the household of any director, nominee for director, executive officer, or\nsignificant shareholder of the company.\n\n7. Professional services can be characterized as advisory in nature, generally involve access to sensitive\ncompany information or to strategic\ndecision-making, and typically have a commission- or fee-based payment structure. Professional services\ngenerally include but are not limited to the following: investment banking/financial advisory services,\ncommercial banking (beyond deposit services), investment services, insurance services, accounting/audit\nservices, consulting services, marketing services, legal services, property management services, realtor\nservices, lobbying services, executive\nsearch services, and IT consulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional\nrelationships and not professional services: deposit services, IT tech support services, educational\nservices, and construction services. The case\nof participation in a banking syndicate by a non-lead bank should be considered a transactional (and hence\nsubject to the associated materiality test) rather than a professional relationship. \u0093Of\nCounsel\u0094 relationships are only considered immaterial if the individual does not receive any form of\ncompensation (in excess of $10,000 per year) from, or is a retired partner of, the firm providing the\nprofessional service. The case of a\ncompany providing a professional service to one of its directors or to an entity with which one of its\ndirectors is affiliated, will be considered a transactional rather than a professional relationship.\nInsurance services and marketing services are\nassumed to be professional services unless the company explains why such services are not advisory.\n\n8. A material transactional relationship,\nincluding grants to non-profit organizations, exists if the company makes annual payments to, or receives\nannual payments from, another entity, exceeding the greater of: $200,000 or 5 percent of the\nrecipient\u0092s gross revenues, for a company that follows NASDAQ listing standards; or the greater of\n$1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues, for a company that follows NYSE listing\nstandards. For a company that\nfollows neither of the preceding standards, ISS will apply the NASDAQ-based materiality test. (The recipient\nis the party receiving the financial proceeds from the transaction).\n\n9. Dissident directors who are parties to a voting agreement pursuant to a settlement or similar arrangement\nmay be classified as Independent\nDirectors if an analysis of the following factors indicates that the voting agreement does not compromise\ntheir alignment with all shareholders\u0092 interests: the terms of the agreement; the duration of the standstill\nprovision in the agreement;\nthe limitations and requirements of actions that are agreed upon; if the dissident director nominee(s) is\nsubject to the standstill; and if there any conflicting relationships or related party transactions.\n\n10.Interlocks include: executive officers serving as directors on each other\u0092s compensation or similar\ncommittees (or, in the\nabsence of such a committee, on the board); or executive officers sitting on each other\u0092s boards and at\nleast one serves on the other\u0092s compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence of such a committee,\non the board).\n\n11. The operating involvement of the founder with the company will be considered; if the founder was never\nemployed by the\ncompany, ISS may deem him or her an Independent Director.\n                                                                       \n  W W W .

For purposes of ISS\u0092s director independence classification, \u0093material\u0094 will be defined as a standard of\nrelationship (financial, personal, or otherwise) that a reasonable person might conclude could potentially\ninfluence one\u0092s objectivity in the boardroom in a manner that would have a meaningful impact on an\nindividual\u0092s ability to satisfy\nrequisite fiduciary standards on behalf of shareholders.\n\nComposition\n\nAttendance at Board and Committee Meetings:Generally vote against or withhold from directors (except\nnominees who served only part of the fiscal year 3) who attend less than 75 percent of the aggregate of\ntheir board and committee meetings for the period for which they served, unless an acceptable reason for\nabsences is disclosed in the proxy or another SEC filing. Acceptable reasons for director absences are\ngenerally limited to the following:\n                                 \n  \u25fe    Medical issues/illness;  \n                                 \n                                 \n  \u25fe    Family emergencies; and  \n                                 \n                                                                                      \n  \u25fe    Missing only one meeting (when the total of all meetings is three or fewer).  \n                                                                                      \nIn cases of chronic poor attendance without reasonable justification, in addition to voting against the\ndirector(s) with poor attendance, generally vote\nagainst or withhold from appropriate members of the nominating/governance committees or the full board.\n\nIf the proxy disclosure is unclear and\ninsufficient to determine whether a director attended at least 75 percent of the aggregate of his/her board\nand committee meetings during his/her period of service, vote against or withhold from the director(s) in\nquestion.\n\nOverboarded Directors:Generally vote against or withhold from individual directors who:\n                                                         \n  \u25fe    Sit on more than five public company boards; or  \n                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n        Are CEOs of public companies who sit on the boards of more than two public companies besides their  \n  \u25fe    own\u0097withhold only                                                                                    \n        at their outside boards4.                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nGender Diversity:Generally vote against or withhold from the chair of the nominating committee (or other\ndirectors on a case-by-casebasis) at companies where there are no women on the company\u0092s board. An exception\nwill be made if there was at least one woman on the board at the preceding annual meeting and the board\nmakes a firm commitment to return to a gender-diverse status within a year.\n\nRacial and/or Ethnic Diversity:For companies in the Russell 3000 or S&P 1500 indices, generally vote against\nor withhold from the chair of the nominating committee (or other directors on a case-by-casebasis) where the\nboard has no apparent racially or ethnically diverse members 5. An exception will be made if there was\nracial and/or ethnic diversity on the board at the preceding annual meeting and the board makes a firm\ncommitment to appoint at least one racial and/or ethnic diverse member within a year.\n\n3 Nominees who served for only part of the fiscal year are generally exempted from the attendance policy.\n\n4 Although all of a CEO\u0092s subsidiary boards with publicly-traded common stock will be\ncounted as separate boards, ISS will not recommend a withhold vote for the CEO of a parent company board or\nany of the controlled (>50 percent ownership) subsidiaries of that parent but may do so at subsidiaries that\nare less than\n50 percent controlled and boards outside the parent/subsidiary relationships.\n\n5\nAggregate diversity statistics provided by the board will only be considered if specific to racial and/or\nethnic diversity.\n                                                                       \n  W W W .

Shareholder Rights & Defenses\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals/Nominations\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon advance notice proposals, giving support to those proposals which\nallow shareholders to submit proposals/nominations as close to the meeting date as reasonably possible and\nwithin the broadest window possible, recognizing the need to allow sufficient notice for company,\nregulatory, and shareholder review.\n\nTo be reasonable, the company\u0092s deadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/nominations must be no earlier\nthan 120 days prior to the anniversary\nof the previous year\u0092s meeting and have a submittal window of no shorter than 30 days from the beginning of\nthe notice period (also known as a 90-120-day window).\nThe submittal window is the period under which shareholders must file their proposals/nominations prior to\nthe deadline.\n\nIn general, support\nadditional efforts by companies to ensure full disclosure in regard to a proponent\u0092s economic and voting\nposition in the company so long as the informational requirements are reasonable and aimed at providing\nshareholders with the necessary\ninformation to review such proposals.\n\nAmend Bylaws without Shareholder Consent\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote against proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws.\n\nVote\ncase-by-case on proposals giving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition to shareholders,\ntaking into account the following:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Any impediments to shareholders\u0092 ability to amend the bylaws (i.e. supermajority voting              \n        requirements);                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                         \n  \u25fe    The company\u0092s ownership structure and historical voting turnout;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n  \u25fe    Whether the board could amend bylaws adopted by shareholders; and  \n                                                                           \n                                                                                                 \n  \u25fe    Whether shareholders would retain the ability to ratify any board-initiated amendments.  \n                                                                                                 \nControl Share Acquisition Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing so\nwould enable the completion of a takeover that would be detrimental to shareholders.\n\nVote\nagainst proposals to amend the charter to include control share acquisition provisions.\n\nVote for proposals to restore voting rights to the control\nshares.\n\nControl share acquisition statutes function by denying shares their voting rights when they contribute to\nownership in excess of certain\nthresholds. Voting rights for those shares exceeding ownership limits may only be restored by approval of\neither a majority or supermajority of disinterested shares. Thus, control share acquisition statutes\neffectively require a hostile bidder to\nput its offer to a shareholder vote or risk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder continues buying up a\nlarge block of shares.\n\nControl Share Cash-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share cash-outstatutes.\n                                                                       \n  W W W .

In other words, when an investor crosses a preset threshold level, remaining shareholders are\ngiven the right to sell their shares to the acquirer, who must buy them at the highest acquiring price.\n\nDisgorgement Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state disgorgement provisions.\n\nDisgorgement provisions require an acquirer or potential acquirer of more than a certain percentage of a\ncompany\u0092s stock to disgorge, or pay back, to the company any profits realized from the sale of that\ncompany\u0092s stock purchased 24 months before achieving control status. All sales of company stock by the\nacquirer occurring within a certain\nperiod of time (between 18 months and 24 months) prior to the investor\u0092s gaining control status are subject\nto these recapture-of-profits provisions.\n\nFair Price Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon proposals to adopt fair price provisions (provisions that\nstipulate that an acquirer must pay the same price to acquire all shares as it paid to acquire the control\nshares), evaluating factors such as the vote required to approve the proposed acquisition, the vote required\nto repeal the fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair price.\n\nGenerally vote against fair price provisions with shareholder vote requirements greater than a majority of\ndisinterested shares.\n\nFreeze-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state freeze-outprovisions. Freeze-outprovisions\nforce an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a company to wait a specified period of\ntime before gaining control of the company.\n\nGreenmail\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments or otherwise\nrestrict a company\u0092s ability to make greenmail payments.\n\nVote case-by-case on anti-greenmail proposals when they are bundled with other charter or bylaw amendments.\n\nGreenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock from individuals or groups\nseeking control of the company.

Also,   \n        there may be sense of urgency by the management team of the SPAC to close the deal since its        \n        charter typically requires a transaction to be                                                      \n        completed within the 18-24-month timeframe.                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Voting agreements - Are the sponsors entering into enter into any voting agreements/tender offers   \n  \u25fe    with shareholders                                                                                   \n        who are likely to vote against the proposed merger or exercise conversion rights?                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Governance - What is the impact of having the SPAC CEO or founder on key committees following the   \n        proposed merger?                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                       \n  W W W .

SVT is expressed as\nboth a dollar amount and as a percentage of market value, and includes the new shares proposed, shares\navailable under existing plans, and\nshares granted but unexercised (using two measures, in the case of plans subject to the Equity Plan\nScorecard evaluation, as noted above). All award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are\nplaced on the most expensive types of\nawards (for example, full-value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be granted will be the\nmost expensive types.\n\nFor proposals that\nare not subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value Transfer is reasonable if it\nfalls below a company-specific benchmark. The benchmark is determined as follows: The top quartile\nperformers in each industry group (using the\nGlobal Industry Classification Standard: GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are\nestablished based on these top performers\u0092 historic SVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group\nto identify the variables most\nstrongly correlated to SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the\nspecific company by plugging the company-specific performance measures, size, and cash compensation into the\nindustry cap equations to arrive\nat the company\u0092s benchmark.22\n\nThree-Year Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\n\nA \u0093Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\u0094 is used for stock plan evaluations. Value-Adjusted Burn Rate benchmarks are\ncalculated as the greater of:\n(1) an industry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the company\u0092s GICS group segmented\nby S&P 500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&P 500) and non-Russell 3000 index; and\n(2) a de minimisthreshold established separately for each of the S&P 500, the Russell 3000 index less the\nS&P 500, and the non-Russell 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-rate benchmark\nchanges will be limited to a predetermined range above or below the prior year\u0092s burn-rate benchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate is\ncalculated as follows:\n\nValue-Adjusted Burn Rate = ((# of options * option\u0092s dollar value using a Black-Scholes model) + (# of full-\nvalue\nawards * stock price)) / (Weighted average common shares * stock price).\n\nEgregious Factors\n\nLiberal Change in Control Definition\n\nGenerally vote against equity plans if the plan has a liberal definition of change in control and the equity\nawards could vest upon such liberal\ndefinition of change in control, even though an actual change in control may not occur. Examples of such a\ndefinition include, but are not limited to, announcement or commencement of a tender offer, provisions for\nacceleration upon a\n\u0093potential\u0094 takeover, shareholder approval of a merger or other transactions, or similar language.\n\n22 For plans evaluated under the Equity Plan Scorecard policy, the company\u0092s SVT benchmark is considered\nalong with other factors.\n                                                                       \n  W W W .

The proposal should clearly articulate\nwhy the board is choosing to conduct an exchange program at this point in time. Repricing underwater options\nafter a recent precipitous drop\nin the company\u0092s stock price demonstrates poor timing and warrants additional scrutiny. Also, consider the\nterms of the surrendered options, such as the grant date, exercise price and vesting schedule. Grant dates\nof surrendered options should\nbe far enough back (two to three years) so as not to suggest that repricings are being done to take\nadvantage of short-term downward price movements. Similarly, the exercise price of surrendered options\nshould be above the 52-week high for the stock price.\n\nVote for shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.\n\nStock Plans in Lieu of Cash\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon plans that provide participants with the option of taking all or\na portion of their cash compensation in the form of stock.\n\nVote for non-employee director-only equity plans that provide a dollar-for-dollar cash-for-stock exchange.\n\nVote case-by-case on plans which do not provide a dollar-for-dollar cash for stock exchange. In cases where\nthe exchange is not\ndollar-for-dollar, the request for new or additional shares for such equity program will be considered using\nthe binomial option pricing model. In an effort to capture\nthe total cost of total compensation, ISS will not make any adjustments to carve out the in-lieu-of cash\ncompensation.\n\nTransfer Stock Option (TSO) Programs\n\nGeneral Recommendation:One-timeTransfers: Vote against or withhold from compensation committee members if\nthey fail to submit one-timetransfers to shareholders for approval.\n\nVote case-by-case on one-time\ntransfers.

Standard stock options and performance-accelerated awards do not meet the criteria to   \n        be considered as performance-based awards. Further, premium-priced options should have a            \n        meaningful premium to be considered performance-based awards.                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Second, assess the rigor of the company\u0092s performance-based equity program. If the bar set for the   \n        performance-based                                                                                   \n        program is too low based on the company\u0092s historical or peer group comparison, generally vote for    \n  \u25fe    the proposal. Furthermore, if target performance results in an above target payout, vote for the    \n        shareholder proposal due to program\u0092s poor                                                           \n        design. If the company does not disclose the performance metric of the performance-based equity     \n        program, vote for the shareholder proposal regardless of the outcome of the first step to the       \n        test.                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nIn general, vote for the shareholder proposal if the company does not meet both of the above two steps.\n                                                                       \n  W W W .

Many companies have\nadopted policies that permit recoupment in cases where an executive\u0092s fraud, misconduct, or negligence\nsignificantly contributed to a\nrestatement of financial results that led to the awarding of unearned incentive compensation. However, such\npolicies may be narrow given that not all misconduct or negligence may result in significant financial\nrestatements.

Social and Environmental Issues\n\nGlobal Approach \u0096 E&S Shareholder Proposals\n\nISS applies a common approach globally to evaluating social and environmental proposals which cover a wide\nrange of topics, including consumer and\nproduct safety, environment and energy, labor standards and human rights, workplace and board diversity, and\ncorporate political issues. While a variety of factors goes into each analysis, the overall principle\nguiding all vote recommendations\nfocuses on how the proposal may enhance or protect shareholder value in either the short or long term.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote case-by-case,examining primarily whether implementation of the\nproposal is likely to enhance or protect shareholder value. The following factors will be considered:\n                                                                                                            \n        If the issues presented in the proposal are being appropriately or effectively dealt with through   \n  \u25fe    legislation or government                                                                           \n        regulation;                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    If the company has already responded in an appropriate and sufficient manner to the issue(s)        \n        raised in the proposal;                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                         \n  \u25fe    Whether the proposal\u0092s request is unduly burdensome (scope or timeframe) or overly prescriptive;  \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n        The company\u0092s approach compared with any industry standard practices for addressing the issue(s)     \n  \u25fe    raised by the                                                                                       \n        proposal;                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Whether there are significant controversies, fines, penalties, or litigation associated with the    \n  \u25fe    company\u0092s practices                                                                                  \n        related to the issue(s) raised in the proposal;                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        If the proposal requests increased disclosure or greater transparency, whether reasonable and       \n  \u25fe    sufficient information is                                                                           \n        currently available to shareholders from the company or from other publicly available sources; and  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        If the proposal requests increased disclosure or greater transparency, whether implementation       \n  \u25fe    would reveal proprietary or                                                                         \n        confidential information that could place the company at a competitive disadvantage.                \n                                                                                                            \nEndorsement of Principles\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote against proposals seeking a company\u0092s endorsement of principles that\nsupport a particular public policy position. Endorsing a set of principles may require a company to take a\nstand on an issue that is beyond its own control and may limit its flexibility with respect to future\ndevelopments.\n\nManagement and the board should be afforded the\nflexibility to make decisions on specific public policy positions based on their own assessment of the most\nbeneficial strategies for the company.\n\nAnimal Welfare\n\nAnimal Welfare Policies\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for proposals seeking a report on a company\u0092s animal welfare\nstandards, or animal welfare-related risks, unless:\n                                                                                                      \n  \u25fe    The company has already published a set of animal welfare standards and monitors compliance;  \n                                                                                                      \n                                                                      \n  \u25fe    The company\u0092s standards are comparable to industry peers; and  \n                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n        There are no recent significant fines, litigation, or controversies related to the company\u0092s and/or  \n  \u25fe    its                                                                                                 \n        suppliers\u0092 treatment of animals.                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                       \n  W W W .
