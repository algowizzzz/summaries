STRATEGY\u201dbeginningon page 25 of the     \n      Prospectus and page 1 of the Summary    \n      Prospectus is deleted and replaced      \n      with the following:                     \n                                              \nIn seeking to track the performance of the\nMSCI USA Gender Diversity Select Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling\nstrategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund\nmay purchase a subset of the securities in the\nIndex in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based\non a number of factors, including asset size\nof the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may invest the Fund\u2019s\nassets in a subset of securities in the Index\nor may invest the Fund\u2019s assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined\nby the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. The Fund\nis classified as \u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may become \u201cnon\u2011diversified\u201d\nsolely as a result of tracking the Index (\ne.g.,changes in weightings of one or more\ncomponent securities). When the Fund is\nnon\u2011diversified, it may invest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its assets in a limited\nnumber of issuers. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but at least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the securities comprising the\nIndex. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments, such as repurchase agreements and\nmoney market funds (including money market\nfunds advised by the Adviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund\u2019s assets may be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries, but only to the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries. Futures contracts (a type\nof derivative instrument) may be used by the\nFund in seeking performance that corresponds\nto the Index and in managing cash flows. The\nMSCI USA Gender Diversity Select Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d) is designed to represent the\nperformance of companies that exhibit a\ncommitment towards promoting and maintaining a\nhigh level of gender diversity across the\ndifferent levels within their organization,\nincluding their corporate board, executive and\nsenior management, and workforce. The\nselection universe for the Index includes all\nconstituents in the MSCI USA Index (the\n\u201cParent Index\u201d), which is designed to measure\nthe performance of the large- and mid\u2011cap\nsegments of the U.S. market. The Index\nincorporates certain gender diversity and\nenvironmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d)\nmetrics developed by MSCI ESG Research (a\nsubsidiary of the Index Provider (defined\nbelow)) to score and screen each security\nwithin the Parent Index. Companies in the\nParent Index are first assigned an ESG\nControversy Score, which provides an\nassessment of controversies concerning any\nnegative environmental, social and/or\ngovernance impact of a company\u2019s operations,\nproducts and services. ESG Controversy Scores\nfall on a 0\u201110 scale, with 0 representing a\ncompany assessed as having involvement in very\nsevere controversies. The Parent Index is\nscreened to remove (i) companies with an ESG\nControversy Score of 0 and (ii) companies not\nassigned an ESG Controversy Score. In\naddition, the Parent Index is also screened to\nremove companies with a Labor Rights \u2013\nDiscrimination and Workforce Diversity\nControversy score of 0 or 1, which are\ncompanies determined as having involvement in\ncertain very severe or severe workforce\ndiversity controversies. Factors affecting\nthis evaluation include, but are not limited\nto, a history of involvement in\ndiscrimination-related legal cases, widespread\nor egregious instances of discrimination on\nthe basis of sex, race, or ethnicity,\nresistance to improved practices, and\nworkplace discrimination-related criticism and\nallegations by non\u2011governmental organizations\nand/or other third-party observers. The\nremaining securities are each assigned an MSCI\nGender Diversity Score based on two\ncomponents: a Women Representation Score and a\nDiversity Management Score. The Women\nRepresentation Score reflects 75% of the\nweight of the MSCI Gender Diversity Score and\nevaluates each company based on the following\ncriteria and the company\u2019s disclosure of such\ncriteria: (i) percent/number of women on the\nboard of directors, (ii) percent of women in\nexecutive management positions, (iii) percent\nof women in senior management positions, and\n(iv) percent of all employees who are women.\nThe Diversity Management Score represents the\nremaining 25% of the weight of the MSCI Gender\nDiversity Score and evaluates each company\nbased on the following criteria: (i) workforce\ndiversity policies and senior management\noversight of such policies; (ii) programs to\nhelp attract, retain and promote women in the\nworkforce, including explicit quantitative\nrecruitment targets and employee benefits; and\n(iii) ability to attract, retain and develop\nhuman capital based on its provision of\nbenefits, training and development programs,\nand employee engagement. Companies are not\neligible for inclusion in the Index if they\nhave (i) no women serving on the board of\ndirectors and no women serving in executive\nmanagement positions or (ii) a Women\nRepresentation Score of 3 or less (based on a\n0\u201110 scale). For each GICS (Global Industry\nClassification Standard) sector, companies are\nselected for inclusion in the Index primarily\nin decreasing order of MSCI Gender Diversity\nScore until 50% of the free float adjusted\nmarket capitalization of the sector is\nreached. The selected securities are weighted\nby the product of their market capitalization\nweight in the Parent Index and the MSCI Gender\nDiversity Score. The weights are then\ndistributed proportionally to sum to 100%.\nSector weights in the Index are set equal to\nthe corresponding sector weight in the Parent\nIndex. To mitigate concentration risk, each\nsecurity\u2019s weight in the Index is capped at\n4.5%, and any weight exceeding this limit will\nbe redistributed on a pro\u2011rata basis to\nsecurities of issuers that do not exceed the\n4.5% limit. The index is rebalanced quarterly,\nand changes are implemented at the end of\nFebruary, May, August and November. As of\nOctober 20, 2022, a significant portion of the\nFund comprised companies in the technology and\nhealth care sectors, although this may change\nfrom time to time. As of October 20, 2022, the\nIndex comprised 268 securities. The Index is\nsponsored by MSCI, Inc. (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Index.\n                                              \n      The \u201cPRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTING IN    \n      THE FUND\u201d section beginning on page 26  \n  4.  of the Prospectus and page 2 of the     \n      Summary Prospectus is updated to add    \n      the following risks as principal risks  \n      of the Fund.                            \n                                              \nESG Investing Risk:The Index\u2019s incorporation\nof ESG considerations in its methodology may\ncause the Fund to make different investments\nthan funds that do not incorporate such\nconsiderations in their strategy or investment\nprocesses. Under certain economic conditions,\nthis could cause the Fund\u2019s investment\nperformance to be worse than funds that do not\nincorporate such considerations. The Index\u2019s\nincorporation of ESG considerations may affect\nthe Fund\u2019s exposure to certain sectors and/or\ntypes of investments, and may adversely impact\nthe Fund\u2019s performance depending on whether\nsuch sectors or investments are in or out of\nfavor in the market. The Index methodology\nincorporates data and scores provided by third\nparties, which may be unavailable or limited\nfor certain issuers and/or only take into\naccount one or a few of many ESG related\ncomponents of portfolio companies. In\ninstances where data or scores are unavailable\nor limited, (i) the Index may include, and the\nFund may therefore hold, securities of\ncompanies that otherwise would not be included\nor held if data or scores were available or\nmore complete, or (ii) the Index, and\ntherefore the Fund, may exclude securities of\ncompanies that otherwise would have been\nincluded or held if data or scores were\navailable or more complete. In addition, ESG\ninformation and scores across third party data\nproviders, indexes and other funds may differ\nand/or be incomparable. To the extent\ncircumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and\nthe Fund may therefore hold for a period of\ntime, securities of companies that do not\nalign with the Fund\u2019s ESG\u2011related objectives\nand/or criteria. Mid\u2011Capitalization Securities\nRisk:The securities of mid\u2011capitalization\ncompanies may be more volatile and may involve\nmore risk than the securities of larger\ncompanies. These companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets or financial resources,\nmay lack the competitive strength of larger\ncompanies, and may depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition, these companies may\nhave been recently organized and may have\nlittle or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid\u2011sized companies may trade\nless frequently and in smaller volumes than\nmore widely held securities. Some securities\nof mid\u2011sized issuers may be illiquid or may be\nrestricted as to resale, and their values may\nbe volatile. Non\u2011Diversification Risk:To the\nextent the Fund becomes \u201cnon\u2011diversified,\u201d the\nFund may hold a smaller number of portfolio\nsecurities than many other funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests in a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a decline in the market\nvalue of a particular security held by the\nFund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than\nthe values of shares of more diversified\nfunds. The Fund may become non\u2011diversified for\nperiods of time solely as a result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one\nor more component securities). Valuation\nRisk:Some portfolio holdings, potentially a\nlarge portion of the Fund\u2019s investment\nportfolio, may be valued on the basis of\nfactors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or\nreduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding\nwhen market quotations are not readily\navailable. The value established for any\nportfolio holding at a point in time might\ndiffer from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced\nusing market quotations. Portfolio holdings\nthat are valued using techniques other than\nmarket quotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time.\n                                              \n      The risk chart within the \u201cADDITIONAL   \n      RISK INFORMATION\u201d section of the        \n      Prospectus is updated to reflect that   \n  5.  \u201cESG Investing Risk\u201d,                   \n      \u201cMid\u2011Capitalization Securities Risk\u201d,   \n      \u201cNon\u2011Diversification Risk\u201d and          \n      \u201cValuation Risk\u201d are principal risks    \n      of the Fund.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      The second paragraph in the             \n      \u201cDiversification Status\u201d discussion in  \n  6.  the \u201cInvestment Policies\u201d section on    \n      page 4 of the SAI is deleted and        \n      replaced with the following:            \n                                              \nEach Fund seeks to track the performance of\nits respective Index. The composition of each\nIndex may fluctuate between non\u2011diversified\nand diversified solely due to changes in\nweightings of one or more Index components. As\na result, a Fund\u2019s diversification status may\nalso fluctuate between non\u2011diversified and\ndiversified depending on the composition of,\nand to approximately the same extent as, its\nrespective Index. To the extent the SPDR S&P\n500 ESG ETF or SPDR MSCI USA Gender Diversity\nETF become non\u2011diversified due solely to\nchanges in the composition of their respective\nIndexes, neither Fund will seek shareholder\napproval if and when the Fund shifts from\ndiversified to non\u2011diversified.\n                                              \n      In connection with the change to the    \n      Fund\u2019s name, the Fund has adopted a     \n      non\u2011fundamental policy with respect to  \n  7.  investments in securities suggested by  \n      its name. Accordingly, the following    \n      is added to the \u201cINVESTMENT             \n      RESTRICTIONS\u201d section beginning on      \n      page 23 of the SAI:                     \n                                              \nThe SPDR MSCI USA Gender Diversity ETF will\nnot, under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of\nborrowings for investment purposes, in\nsecurities of United States companies. Prior\nto any change in this 80% investment policy,\nthe Fund will provide shareholders with 60\ndays\u2019 written notice. PLEASE RETAIN THIS\nSUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE 103122SUPP1\n"
