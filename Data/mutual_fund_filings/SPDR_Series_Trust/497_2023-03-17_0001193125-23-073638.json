The Index represents the software\nand services segment of the S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S. equity market. The\nsoftware and services segment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the following sub\u2011industries:\nApplication Software, Interactive Home\nEntertainment, IT Consulting & Other Services,\nand Systems Software. The Index is one of\ntwenty\u2011one (21) of the S&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect Industry Indices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the performance of a\nnarrow sub\u2011industry or group of sub\u2011industries\ndetermined based on the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership\nin the Select Industry Indices is based on the\nGICS classification, as well as liquidity and\nmarket cap requirements. Companies in the\nSelect Industry Indices are classified\naccording to GICS which determines\nclassifications primarily based on revenues;\nhowever, earnings and market perception are\nalso considered. The Index consists of the S&P\nTMI constituents belonging to the Application\nSoftware, Interactive Home Entertainment, IT\nConsulting & Other Services, and Systems\nSoftware sub\u2011industries that satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (i) have a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization greater than or equal to\n$500 million with a float-adjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by dollar value traded over the\nprevious 12 months divided by the float-\nadjusted market capitalization as of the index\nrebalancing reference date) greater than or\nequal to 90% or have a float-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater than or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-adjusted liquidity ratio\n(as defined above) greater than or equal to\n150%; and (ii) are U.S. based companies. To\nevaluate liquidity, the dollar value traded\nfor initial public offerings or spin-offs that\ndo not have 12 months of trading history is\nannualized. The market capitalization\nthreshold may be relaxed to ensure that there\nare at least 22 stocks in the Index as of the\nrebalancing effective date. Existing Index\nconstituents are removed at the quarterly\nrebalancing effective date if either their\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls below 50%. The market\ncapitalization threshold and the liquidity\nthreshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index\nrebalances and reconstitutes quarterly on the\nthird Friday of the quarter ending month. The\nreference date for additions and deletions is\nafter the close of the last trading date of\nthe previous month.
