You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.28%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses1                        0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.28%  \n                                                \n1 \u201cOther expenses\u201d are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year. Example: This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated, and then sell or\nhold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may\nbe higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                  \n  Year 1  Year 3  \n  $29        $90  \n                  \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities\n(or \u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not\nreflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. The Fund had\nnot commenced operations as of the date of this Prospectus and, as a result, does not yet have a portfolio\nturnover rate. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy The Fund seeks to track the performance of the\nBloomberg Enhanced Roll Yield Total Return Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d). Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its net assets (plus borrowings, if any), directly\nor indirectly, in securities and/or other instruments comprising the index it seeks to track or in\ninstruments providing exposure to securities and/or other instruments comprising the index it seeks to\ntrack. Prior to any change in this 80% investment policy, the Fund will provide shareholders with 60 days'\nnotice. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective primarily through exposure to commodity-linked\nderivative instruments based on the Index. The Fund expects to gain exposure to these investments by\ninvesting in a wholly-owned subsidiary, an exempted limited company organized under the laws of the Cayman\nIslands (\u201cSubsidiary\u201d). The Fund may, to a lesser extent, invest directly in these instruments. The Fund\nexpects to obtain a substantial amount of its exposure to the investment results of the Index through direct\nor indirect investments in total return swaps that provide returns similar to the commodity futures\ncontracts in the Index. The Subsidiary and Fund may also invest in other commodity-linked derivative\ninstruments, including futures contracts. The performance of these commodity-linked derivative instruments\n\n1\n\nis expected to correspond to the performance of the Index, without requiring the Fund to invest directly in\ncommodities. The Subsidiary and the Fund may also invest in cash and cash equivalents (including U.S.\ntreasury obligations) or money market instruments (including money market funds advised by SSGA FM), which\nare intended to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and serve as collateral for the Subsidiary's or Fund's\nderivative instruments. The Subsidiary is managed by SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, and has the same investment strategy as the Fund. The Fund's\ninvestments in the Subsidiary generally provide the Fund with exposure to commodity-linked derivatives\ninstruments within the limits of the federal tax laws, which limit the ability of investment companies like\nthe Fund to invest directly in such instruments. The Fund will not invest more than 25% of the value of its\ntotal assets in the Subsidiary. The Index measures the performance of a diversified, liquid and cost-\neffective long exposure to the broad commodities market through synthetic positions in futures contracts,\nwith no single commodity or sector dominating the Index. The Index is calculated on a total return basis,\nwhich reflects the returns on a fully collateralized investment in the Index. This combines the returns of\nthe Index with the returns on cash collateral invested in U.S. Treasury Bills. The Index methodology selects\ncommodities that are both sufficiently significant to the world economy as measured by liquidity and\ntradable through a qualifying related futures contract. Commodity futures contracts normally specify a\ncertain date for the delivery of the underlying physical commodity. To avoid the effects of the delivery\nprocess on Index performance and to maintain a long futures position, the Index embeds a \u201crolling\u201d process.\nIn a rolling process, nearby futures contracts are sold and contracts that have not yet reached the delivery\nperiod are purchased. The Index is composed of three to four futures contracts for each commodity, which are\nrolled each month to a new set of futures contracts, and each contract for a specific commodity is equally\nweighted. The contract rolls take place over the first ten business days of each month. In January of each\nyear, the Index rebalances new commodity target weights. The commodity target weights are calculated on the\nlast business day of November and implemented within the first ten business days of January of the following\nyear. The commodity target weights are calculated by combining commodity liquidity percentages and slope\nscores. Commodity liquidity percentages are determined for each commodity by taking a three-year average of\ndaily trading volumes and dividing by the sum of such trading volumes for all the commodities. The commodity\nliquidity percentages are then adjusted based on the following diversification capping process to mitigate\nover-concentration to any individual commodity or commodity group: \u2022 No single commodity (e.g., natural gas,\nsilver) can exceed 15% of the Index; \u2022 No commodity group (e.g., energy, precious metals) may constitute\nmore than 33% of the Index; and \u2022 No single commodity (e.g., natural gas, silver) may constitute less than\n1.5% of the Index as liquidity allows. Each commodity is also assigned a \u201cSlope Score\u201d, which is the three\nyear daily average shape of the commodity futures forward curve from nearby to 1 year ahead. The Slope Score\nis a measure of how backwardated (downward sloping) or contangoed (upward sloping) each commodity is.\n\u201cContango\u201d refers to a pattern of higher futures prices for longer expiration futures contracts, while\n\u201cbackwardation\u201d refers to a pattern of higher futures prices for shorter expiration futures contracts. The\ncommodity with the highest degree of backwardation is given the highest slope score, which results in a\nhigher allocation weighting for that commodity. Similar to the liquidity measure, the slope score per\ncommodity is standardized relative to the universe. In the final step to calculate commodity target weights,\nboth the diversified liquidity percentages and slope scores are assessed. For each commodity, the liquidity\npercentage and the slope score are scaled and multiplied to generate a relative weight by standardizing\nacross the commodity universe. As of July 31, 2024, the following commodities were eligible for inclusion in\nthe Index: agricultural (Chicago Wheat, Kansas Wheat, Soybean, Soybean Oil, Corn, Cotton, Coffee and Sugar),\nenergy (Brent Crude Oil, Gasoil, WTI Crude Oil, Heating Oil, Natural Gas and Gasoline), industrial metals\n(Copper, Zinc, Tin, Nickel, Lead and Aluminum), livestock (Live Cattle, Lean Hogs and Feeder Cattle) and\nprecious metals (Gold and Silver). In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in\nan industry or group of industries, but only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a particular\nindustry or group of industries. As of July 31, 2024, the Index had significant exposure to precious metals\ncommodities, agricultural commodities, and energy commodities. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or SSGA FM. The Index\nProvider determines the composition of the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the Index and\npublishes information regarding the market value of the Index. 2 The phrase \u201cNo K-1\u201d in the Fund's name\nmeans that the Fund does not issue a Schedule K-1, which is the tax reporting form issued by commodities\npartnerships. Schedule K-1 typically presents additional complexities. Instead, like most other ETFs, the\nFund reports income on Form 1099. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all investments, there\nare certain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose money by\ninvesting in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency. References to the \u201cFund\u201d below should be read to also\napply to the Subsidiary where the context requires. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities and commodities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in\ninterest rates, inflation, changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities and\ncommodities markets and adversely affect global economies and markets. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or other\npublic health issues, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments.\nCommodities and Commodity-Linked Derivatives Risk: Commodity prices can have significant volatility, and\nexposure to commodities can cause the net asset value of Fund Shares to decline or fluctuate in a rapid and\nunpredictable manner. A liquid secondary market may not exist for certain commodity investments, which may\nmake it difficult for the Fund to sell them at a desirable price or at the price at which it is carrying\nthem. The value of commodities and commodity-linked derivative instruments typically is based upon the price\nmovements of a physical commodity or an economic variable linked to such price movements. Therefore, the\nvalue of commodities and commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by, for example, changes in\noverall market movements, economic conditions, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular\ncommodity or industry, such as production, supply, demand, drought, floods, weather, political, economic and\nregulatory developments. These factors may impair the ability of the Fund to sell its portfolio holdings\nquickly or for full value. Commodity-linked derivatives are subject to the risk that the counterparty to the\ntransaction may default or otherwise fail to perform. Agricultural Commodities: Price movements in\nagricultural commodities are affected by many factors, some of which include, but are not limited to: farmer\nplanting decisions; weather conditions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, storms and droughts; changes in\nglobal supply and demand for agriculture products; the price and quantity of imports and exports of\nagricultural commodities; general economic, market and regulatory factors; political conditions, including\nembargoes and war, in or affecting agricultural production, imports and exports; and technological advances\nin agricultural production. Energy Commodities: Energy commodities are subject to frequent, and often\nsubstantial, price fluctuations. The markets and prices for energy commodities are affected by many factors,\nsome of which include, but are not limited to: changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\nthe price and quantity of imports and exports of oil and natural gas; political conditions, including\nembargoes and war, in or affecting oil producing activities; the level of global oil and natural gas\nexploration, inventories, production or pricing; weather conditions; technological advances effecting energy\nconsumption; and the price and availability of alternative fuels. Metals Commodities: Price movements in\nmetals commodities are affected by many factors. A change in economic conditions, such as a recession, can\nadversely affect the price of metals. An economic downturn may have a negative impact on the usage and\ndemand of metals, which may result in a loss for the Fund. Other factors affecting prices include, but are\nnot limited to: a sudden shift in political conditions in the world's leading metal producing countries; an\nincrease in the hedging of precious metals; changes in global supply and demand for industrial and precious\nmetals; the price and quantity of imports and exports of industrial and precious metals; and technological\nadvances in the processing and mining of industrial and precious metals. Derivatives Risk: Derivative\ntransactions can create investment leverage and may have significant volatility. It is possible that a\nderivative transaction will result in a much greater loss than the principal amount invested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to close out a derivative transaction at a favorable time or price. The counterparty to a\nderivatives contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the Fund's\nmargin, or otherwise honor its obligations. A derivatives transaction may not behave in the manner\nanticipated by the Adviser or may not have the effect on the Fund anticipated by the Adviser. 3 Swaps Risk:\nA swap is a two-party contract that generally obligates the parties to exchange payments based on a\nspecified reference security, basket of securities, security index or index component and/or other\ninstruments. A total return swap is an agreement between two parties in which one party agrees to make\npayments of the total return of a reference asset in return for payments equal to a rate of interest on\nanother reference asset. Swaps generally can involve greater risks than direct investment in securities\nbecause swaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a counterparty's\ndefaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to\nvalue). It may not be possible for the Fund to liquidate a swap position at an advantageous time or price,\nwhich may result in significant losses. Frequent transactions in swaps may result in higher Fund expenses\nand may result in increased taxable distributions to investors, including potentially increased\ndistributions that are taxable to individuals as ordinary income. Futures Contract Risk: A futures contract\nis a standardized agreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a specific price at a\nspecific future time, or cash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in futures contracts can\ncreate investment leverage and may have significant volatility. It is possible that a futures contract\ntransaction will result in a much greater loss than the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time or price. There is no assurance that a liquid\nsecondary market on an exchange will exist for any particular futures contract. In the event no such market\nexists, it might not be possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to terminate\nits exposure to the futures contract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in the\nprices of the futures contract and movements in the price of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or\notherwise honor its obligations. Counterparty Risk: The Fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to\nthe counterparties with which the Fund enters into derivatives instruments, as well as other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, the Fund may be unable to terminate or realize\nany gain on the investment or transaction, or to recover collateral posted to the counterparty, resulting in\na loss to the Fund. If the Fund holds collateral posted by its counterparty, it may be delayed or prevented\nfrom realizing on the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Commodity-Linked Derivative Tax Risk: To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax\ntreatment accorded to regulated investment companies (\u201cRICs\u201d), the Fund must, among other things, derive in\neach taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from certain prescribed sources. The Fund generally\nintends to invest in commodity-linked derivative instruments indirectly through the Subsidiary. The Fund's\ninvestment in the Subsidiary is expected to provide the Fund with exposure to the commodities markets within\nthe limitations of the federal tax requirements of the Code for qualification as a RIC. The Adviser intends\nto conduct the Fund's investments in the Subsidiary in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of\nthe regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury, and will monitor the Fund's investments in the Subsidiary\nto ensure that no more than 25% of the Fund's assets are invested in the Subsidiary. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought\nand sold in the secondary market at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the secondary market\nmay differ from the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market volatility or periods of steep market declines. Cash\nPosition Risk: If the Fund holds a significant position in cash or cash equivalents, its investment returns\nmay be adversely affected, and the Fund may underperform other funds that do not similarly invest in cash\nand cash equivalents for investment purposes and/or to collateralize derivative instruments. Cash\nTransaction Risk: The Fund may sell portfolio securities to meet some or all of a redemption request with\ncash. In such cases, the Fund may incur taxable gains or losses that it might not have incurred had it made\nredemptions entirely in-kind. As a result, the Fund may pay out higher annual capital gain distributions\nthan if the in-kind redemption process was used. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed\nwith an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities and/or other instruments, regardless of the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities and/or other instruments comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed\nfund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less\nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment 4 strategy. The structure and\ncomposition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently,\nthe performance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time, investments that do not align with\nthe Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to the component securities and/or other\ninstruments of the Index and the Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction costs\nand market exposure arising from such portfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or reconstituting its holdings to\nreflect changes in the Index. The Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains to its shareholders\nto avoid adverse federal income tax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the performance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), the Fund's return may not match the\nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities and/or other instruments. In addition, the Fund may not be fully\ninvested at times, generally as a result of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by\nthe Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer than\nall of the securities and/or other instruments in the Index, or in securities and/or other instruments not\nincluded in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return and that of\nthe Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on resale may\nlimit the ability of the Fund to sell a security and/or other instrument at an advantageous time or price or\nat all. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may\nlead to differences between the market price of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the Fund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit the\nability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain market or sector. Money\nMarket Fund Investment Risk: An investment in a money market fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not\ninsured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Certain money market funds seek to\npreserve the value of their shares at $1.00 per share, although there can be no assurance that they will do\nso, and it is possible to lose money by investing in such a money market fund. A major or unexpected change\nin interest rates or a decline in the credit quality of an issuer or entity providing credit support, an\ninactive trading market for money market instruments, or adverse market, economic, industry, political,\nregulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions could cause the share price of such a money market fund to\nfall below $1.00. Other money market funds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV that will fluctuate along\nwith changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Shares sold utilizing a floating NAV may be worth\nmore or less than their original purchase price. Recent changes in the regulation of money market funds may\naffect the operations and structures of money market funds. New Fund Risk: The Fund is new and there is no\nassurance that the Fund will grow quickly. When the Fund's size is small, the Fund may experience low\ntrading volume, which could lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of\nthe Fund could cause elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its\nshareholders. Non-Diversification Risk: As a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of\ninvestments than many other funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a\ndecline in the market value of a particular investment held by the Fund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may become diversified for periods of time solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component securities and/or other\ninstruments). Subsidiary Investment Risk: The Subsidiary is not registered under the Investment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d) and is not subject to all of the investor protections of the 1940 Act.\nThus, the Fund, as an investor in the Subsidiary, will not have all of the protections offered to investors\nin registered investment companies. In addition, changes in the laws of the United States and/or the Cayman\nIslands could result in the inability of the Fund to operate as intended and could negatively affect the\nFund and its shareholders. 5 U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk: U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other\nfixed income securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics.\nSimilar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S. government may\ncause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. Valuation Risk: Some portfolio holdings,\npotentially a large portion of the Fund's investment portfolio, may be valued on the basis of factors other\nthan market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market quotations are not readily\navailable. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ from what would\nbe produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if market quotations\nwere used. In addition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for\nthe value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime. Fund Performance The Fund had not commenced operations as of the date of this Prospectus. Once the\nFund has completed a full calendar year of operations, a bar chart and table will be included that will\nprovide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing the variability of the Fund's\nreturns based on net assets and comparing the Fund's performance to the Index. When available, updated\nperformance information may be obtained by calling 1-866-787-2257 or visiting the Fund's website:\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Portfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment\nadviser to the Fund. Portfolio Managers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Karl Schneider, Amy Cheng and Kala O'Donnell. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Head of Traditional Beta Strategies for the Global Equity Beta Solutions Group\nin the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Amy Cheng is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta Solutions Group. She joined the Adviser in 2000. Kala O'Donnell\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta Solutions Group.\nShe joined the Adviser in 1995. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of\nFund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit\nor delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the \u201cExchange\u201d), other national securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because\nFund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from a tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. 6 Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 7 Additional Strategies Information Principal Strategies\nGeneral . Please see \u201cThe Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\u201d section under \u201cFund Summary\u201d above for a\ndiscussion of the Fund's principal investment strategy. The Fund may invest in various types of instruments\nand engage in various investment techniques which are not the principal focus of the Fund and therefore are\nnot described in this Prospectus. These investments, techniques and practices, together with their risks,\nare described in the Statement of Additional Information (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain free of charge by\ncontacting shareholder services (see the back cover of this Prospectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Fund's Index as closely as possible (i.e ., obtain a high\ndegree of correlation with the Index). A number of factors may affect the Fund's ability to achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with its Index, and there can be no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree\nof correlation. For example, the Fund may not be able to achieve a high degree of correlation with its Index\nwhen there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved in compiling a portfolio of securities\nand/or instruments to follow the Index, when a security and/or instrument in the Index becomes temporarily\nilliquid, unavailable or less liquid, or legal restrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from investing in a\nsecurity and/or instrument in the Index. In addition, from time to time, investments are added to or removed\nfrom the Index. The Adviser may sell investments or instruments providing exposure to investments that are\nrepresented in the Index, or purchase investments or instruments providing exposure to investments that are\nnot yet represented in the Index, in anticipation of their removal from or addition to the Index. Further,\nthe Adviser may choose to overweight exposure to investments in the Index, purchase or sell investments or\ninstruments providing exposure to investments not in the Index, or utilize various combinations of other\navailable techniques, in seeking to track the Index. The Fund's investment in the Subsidiary may not exceed\n25% of the Fund's total assets at each quarter end of the Fund's fiscal year. The Subsidiary has the same\ninvestment objective as the Fund, but unlike the Fund, it may invest to a greater extent in commodity-linked\nderivative instruments. Like the Fund, the Subsidiary also may invest in cash or highly liquid securities\nintended to promote liquidity, preserve capital, and serve as margin or collateralize the Subsidiary's\npositions in commodity-linked derivative instruments. The Fund, as described in the SAI, has adopted a non-\nfundamental investment policy to invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of borrowings for\ninvestment purposes, in the index the Fund seeks to track. The Fund will provide shareholders with at least\n60 days' notice prior to any change in this non-fundamental 80% investment policy. The Board of Trustees of\nthe Trust (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change the Fund's investment strategy, Index and other policies without\nshareholder approval, except as otherwise indicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI. The Board may also\nchange the Fund's investment objective without shareholder approval. Non-Principal Strategies Temporary\nDefensive Positions. In certain situations or market conditions, the Fund may temporarily depart from its\nnormal investment policies and strategies, provided that the alternative is consistent with the Fund's\ninvestment objective and is in the best interest of the Fund. Borrowing Money . The Fund may borrow money\nfrom a bank as permitted by the 1940 Act, or other governing statute, by the rules thereunder, or by the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund, but\nonly for temporary or emergency purposes. The 1940 Act presently allows the Fund to borrow from any bank\n(including pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total assets (not\nincluding temporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of its total assets). The Fund may also invest in reverse\nrepurchase agreements or similar financing transactions. Consistent with a rule under the 1940 Act, the Fund\nmay treat such investments as either borrowings or derivatives transactions. To the extent the Fund treats\nreverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions as borrowings, such investments will also be\nincluded in the 33 1/3% limit. Under normal circumstances, any borrowings by the Fund (including investments\nin reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions treated as borrowings) will not exceed\n10% of the Fund's total assets. Lending of Securities . The Fund may lend its portfolio securities in an\namount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets via a securities lending program through its\nsecurities lending agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d or the \u201cLending Agent\u201d), to\nbrokers, dealers and other financial institutions desiring to borrow securities to complete transactions and\nfor other purposes. A securities lending program allows the Fund to receive a portion of 8 the income\ngenerated by lending its securities and investing the respective collateral. The Fund will receive\ncollateral for each loaned security which is at least equal to the market value of that security, marked to\nmarket each trading day. To the extent the Fund receives cash collateral, as of the date of this Prospectus,\nthe Adviser expects to invest such cash collateral in a fund managed by the Adviser that invests in: a broad\nrange of money market instruments; certificates of deposit and time deposits of U.S. and foreign banks;\ncommercial paper and other high quality obligations of U.S. or foreign companies; asset-backed securities;\nmortgage-related securities; repurchase agreements; and shares of money market funds. In the securities\nlending program, the borrower generally has the right to vote the loaned securities; however, the Fund may\ncall loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the Fund's economic interest in the investment is\nto be voted upon. Security loans may be terminated at any time by the Fund. Additional Risk Information The\nfollowing section provides information regarding the principal risks identified under \u201cPrincipal Risks of\nInvesting in the Fund\u201d in the Fund Summary along with additional risk information. References to the \u201cFund\u201d\nbelow should be read to also apply to the Subsidiary where the context requires. Principal Risks Cash\nPosition Risk . If the Fund holds a significant portion of its assets in cash or cash equivalents, the Fund\nmay underperform other funds that do not hold cash and cash equivalents for investment purposes and/or to\ncollateralize derivatives instruments. In addition, the Fund is subject to the credit risk of the depository\ninstitution at which the cash is held and any related fees. Cash Transaction Risk . To the extent the Fund\nsells portfolio securities to meet some or all of a redemption request with cash, the Fund may incur taxable\ngains or losses that it might not have incurred had it made redemptions entirely in-kind. As a result, the\nFund may pay out higher annual capital gain distributions than if the in-kind redemption process was used.\nCommodities and Commodity-Linked Derivatives Risk. The Fund may invest in commodities and commodity-linked\nderivatives. Investments linked to the prices of commodities may be considered speculative. Commodity prices\ncan have significant volatility, and exposure to commodities can cause the net asset value of Fund Shares to\ndecline or fluctuate in a rapid and unpredictable manner. A liquid secondary market may not exist for\ncertain commodity investments, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at a desirable price or\nat the price at which it is carrying them. The value of commodities and commodity-linked derivative\ninstruments typically is based upon the price movements of a physical commodity or an economic variable\nlinked to such price movements. Therefore, the value of commodities and commodity-linked derivative\ninstruments may be affected by, for example, changes in overall market movements, economic conditions,\nchanges in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular commodity or industry, such as production,\nsupply, demand, drought, floods, weather, political, economic and regulatory developments. These factors may\nimpair the ability of the Fund to sell its portfolio holdings quickly or for full value. Commodity-linked\nderivatives are subject to the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may default or otherwise fail\nto perform. In addition to the factors set forth above, the Fund is subject to the risks related to the\nunderlying commodities: Agricultural Commodities Risk. The price and availability of agricultural\ncommodities are affected by many factors, including but not limited to: farmer planting decisions; weather\nconditions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, storms and droughts; changes in global supply and demand for\nagriculture products; the price and quantity of imports and exports of agricultural commodities; general\neconomic and market factors; political conditions, including embargoes and war, in or affecting agricultural\nproduction, imports and exports; and technological advances in agricultural production. Agricultural\ncommodity production is subject to government regulation that may materially affect operations. Governmental\npolicies related to taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, acreage control, and import and export\nrestrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products, can influence the planting of certain\ncrops, the location and size of crop production, the volume and types of imports and exports, and industry\nprofitability. Additionally, commodity production is affected by laws and regulations relating to, but not\nlimited to, the sourcing, transporting, storing and processing of agricultural raw materials as well as the\ntransporting, storing and 9 distributing of related agricultural products. Agricultural commodity producers\nalso may need to comply with various environmental laws and regulations, such as those regulating the use of\ncertain pesticides, and local laws that regulate the production of genetically modified crops. In addition,\ninternational trade disputes can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or\ndisrupting trade between countries or regions. Energy Commodities Risk. Energy markets can be significantly\naffected by fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of energy fuels. The prices of energy\ncommodities, such as crude oil, heating oil and natural gas, are subject to frequent, and often substantial,\nprice fluctuations. Energy commodities have had significant price swings in recent years. In particular, the\nprices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and volatility is expected to continue.\nSuch fluctuations can be the result of changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\npolitical conditions, including embargoes and war, in or affecting oil producing activities; the price and\nquantity of imports and exports of oil and natural gas; the level of global oil and natural gas exploration,\ninventories, production or pricing; weather conditions; technological advances effecting energy consumption;\nand the price and availability of alternative fuels. Energy companies may also be impacted by government\nregulations related to environmental protection, health and safety, and potential civil liabilities such as\nenvironmental damage claims. Metals Commodities. Price movements in metals commodities may fluctuate\nsubstantially over short periods of time and may rise and fall in response to many factors, including: a\nsudden shift in political conditions in the world's leading metal producing countries; an increase in the\nhedging of precious metals; changes in global supply and demand for industrial and precious metals; the\nprice and quantity of imports and exports of industrial and precious metals; and technological advances in\nthe processing and mining of industrial and precious metals. The prices of precious metals may be influenced\nby macroeconomic conditions, including confidence in the global monetary system and the relative strength of\nvarious currencies, as well as demand in the industrial and jewelry sectors. Political events also influence\nthe prices of precious metals. Prices are also influenced by supplies of precious metals, which may be\naffected by sales by central banks and governmental agencies that hold large amounts of these metals,\nparticularly gold. The prices of commodities comprising the industrial metals are subject to a number of\nfactors that can cause price fluctuations, including changes in the level of industrial activity;\ndisruptions in mining, storing, and refining the metals; adjustments to inventory; variations in production\ncosts; and regulatory compliance costs. A change in economic conditions, such as a recession, can adversely\naffect the price of metals. None of these factors can be controlled in managing the Fund. Even if current\nand correct information about all factors are known or thought to be known, prices still may not behave as\npredicted. Derivatives Risk. A derivative is a financial contract the value of which depends on, or is\nderived from, the value of an underlying asset, interest rate, or index. Derivative transactions typically\ninvolve leverage and may have significant volatility. It is possible that a derivative transaction will\nresult in a loss greater than the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be able to close out a\nderivative transaction at a favorable time or price. Risks associated with derivative instruments include\npotential changes in value in response to interest rate changes or other market developments or as a result\nof the counterparty's credit quality; the potential for the derivative transaction not to have the effect\nthe Adviser anticipated or a different or less favorable effect than the Adviser anticipated; the failure of\nthe counterparty to the derivative transaction to perform its obligations under the transaction or to settle\na trade; possible mispricing or improper valuation of the derivative instrument; imperfect correlation in\nthe value of a derivative with the asset, rate, or index underlying the derivative; the risk that the Fund\nmay be required to post collateral or margin with its counterparty, and will not be able to recover the\ncollateral or margin in the event of the counterparty's insolvency or bankruptcy; the risk that the Fund\nwill experience losses on its derivatives investments and on its other portfolio investments, even when the\nderivatives investments may be intended in part or entirely to hedge those portfolio investments; the risks\nspecific to the asset underlying the derivative instrument; lack of liquidity for the derivative instrument,\nincluding, without limitation, absence of a secondary trading market; the potential for reduced returns to\nthe Fund due to losses on the transaction and an increase in volatility; the potential for the derivative\ntransaction to have the effect of accelerating the recognition of gain; and legal risks arising from the\ndocumentation relating to the derivative transaction. 10 Swaps Risk. A swap is a two-party contract that\ngenerally obligates the parties to exchange payments based on a specified reference security, basket of\nsecurities, security index or index component and/or other instrument. A total return swap is an agreement\nbetween two parties in which one party agrees to make payments of the total return of a reference asset in\nreturn for payments equal to a rate of interest on another reference asset. Total return swap agreements may\nbe used to obtain exposure to a security or market without owning or taking physical custody of such\nsecurity or investing directly in such market. Total return swap agreements may effectively add leverage to\nthe Fund's portfolio because, in addition to its total net assets, the Fund would be subject to investment\nexposure on the notional amount of the swap. Swaps generally can involve greater risks than direct\ninvestment in securities because swaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk ( e.g. , the\nrisk of a counterparty's defaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk ( i.e. ,\nswaps may be difficult to value). Swaps may also be considered illiquid. It may not be possible for the Fund\nto liquidate a swap position at an advantageous time or price, which may result in significant losses.\nFrequent transactions in swaps may result in higher Fund expenses and may result in increased taxable\ndistributions to investors, including potentially increased distributions that are taxable to individuals as\nordinary income. Futures Contract Risk . The risk of loss relating to the use of futures contracts is\npotentially unlimited. The ability to establish and close out positions in futures contracts will be subject\nto the development and maintenance of a liquid secondary market. There is no assurance that a liquid\nsecondary market on an exchange will exist for any particular futures contract or at any particular time. In\nthe event no such market exists, it might not be possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund will\nbe unable to terminate the futures contract. In using futures contracts, the Fund will be reliant on the\nability of the Adviser to predict market and price movements correctly; the skills needed to use such\nfutures contracts successfully are different from those needed for traditional portfolio management. If the\nFund uses futures contracts for hedging purposes, there is a risk of imperfect correlation between movements\nin the prices of the futures contracts and movements in the securities or index underlying the futures\ncontracts or movements in the prices of the Fund's investments that are the subject of such hedge. The\nprices of futures contracts, for a number of reasons, may not correlate perfectly with movements in the\nsecurities or index underlying them. For example, participants in the futures markets are subject to margin\ndeposit requirements. Such requirements may cause investors to take actions with respect to their futures\npositions that they would not otherwise take. The margin requirements in the futures markets may be less\nonerous than margin requirements in the securities markets in general, and as a result those markets may\nattract more speculators than the securities markets do. Increased participation by speculators in those\nmarkets may cause temporary price distortions. Due to the possibility of price distortion, even a correct\nforecast of general market trends by the Adviser still may not result in a successful futures activity over\na very short time period. The risk of a position in a futures contract may be very large compared to the\nrelatively low level of margin the Fund is required to deposit. The Fund will typically be required to post\nmargin with its futures commission merchant in connection with its transactions in futures contracts. In\nmany cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial\nloss or gain to the investor relative to the size of a required margin deposit. The Fund will incur\nbrokerage fees in connection with its futures transactions. In the event of an insolvency of the futures\ncommission merchant or a clearing house, the Fund may not be able to recover all (or any) of the margin it\nhas posted with the futures commission merchant, or to realize the value of any increase in the price of its\npositions, or it may experience a significant delay in doing so. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n(the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various exchanges have established limits referred to as \u201cspeculative position limits\u201d\non the maximum net long or net short positions that any person and certain affiliated entities may hold or\ncontrol in a particular futures contract. In addition, federal position limits apply to swaps that are\neconomically equivalent to futures contracts that are subject to CFTC-set speculative limits. All positions\nowned or controlled by the same person or entity, even if in different accounts, must be aggregated for\npurposes of complying with position limits. It is possible that the positions of different clients managed\nby the Adviser may be aggregated for this purpose. Therefore, the trading decisions of the Adviser may have\nto be modified and positions held by the Fund liquidated in order to avoid exceeding such limits. The\nmodification of investment decisions or the elimination of open positions, if it occurs, may adversely\naffect the performance of the Fund. A violation of position limits could also lead to regulatory action\nmaterially adverse to the Fund's investment strategy. In addition, exchanges may establish accountability\nlevels applicable to a futures contract instead of position limits, provided that the futures contract is\nnot subject to federal position limits. An exchange may order a person who holds or controls a position in\nexcess of a position accountability level not to further increase its position, to comply with any\nprospective limit that exceeds the size of 11 the position owned or controlled, or to reduce any open\nposition that exceeds the position accountability level if the exchange determines that such action is\nnecessary to maintain an orderly market. Position accountability levels could adversely affect the Fund's\nability to establish and maintain positions in commodity futures contracts to which such levels apply, if\nthe Fund were to trade in such contracts, and the Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective.\nFutures contracts traded on markets outside the U.S. are not generally subject to the same level of\nregulation by the CFTC or other U.S. regulatory entities as contracts traded in the U.S., including without\nlimitation as to the execution, delivery, and clearing of transactions. U.S. regulators neither regulate the\nactivities of a foreign exchange, nor have the power to compel enforcement of the rules of the foreign\nexchange or the laws of the foreign country in question. Margin and other payments made by the Fund may not\nbe afforded the same protections as are afforded those payments in the U.S., including in connection with\nthe insolvency of an executing or clearing broker or a clearinghouse or exchange. Certain foreign futures\ncontracts may be less liquid and more volatile than U.S. contracts. Counterparty Risk . The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties with which the Fund enters into derivatives\ninstruments such as total return swaps and futures contracts, as well as other transactions. The Fund's\nability to profit from these types of investments and transactions will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its obligations. If a counterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund may be unable to terminate or realize any gain on the investment or transaction,\nresulting in a loss to the Fund. The Fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in an\ninsolvency, bankruptcy, or other reorganization proceeding involving its counterparty (including recovery of\nany collateral posted by it) and may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such\ncircumstances. If the Fund holds collateral posted by its counterparty, it may be delayed or prevented from\nrealizing on the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or contractual provisions, including if the Fund enters into an\ninvestment or transaction with a financial institution and such financial institution (or an affiliate of\nthe financial institution) experiences financial difficulties, then the Fund may in certain situations be\nprevented or delayed from exercising its rights to terminate the investment or transaction, or to realize on\nany collateral and may result in the suspension of payment and delivery obligations of the parties under\nsuch investment or transactions or in another institution being substituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, the Fund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under applicable law\nwhereby, if required by the financial institution's authority, the financial institution's liabilities could\nbe written down, eliminated or converted into equity or an alternative instrument of ownership. A bail-in of\na financial institution may result in a reduction in value of some or all of its securities and, if the Fund\nholds such securities or has entered into a transaction with such a financial security when a bail-in\noccurs, the Fund may also be similarly impacted. Leveraging Risk. Derivatives transactions may create\ninvestment leverage. If the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio, the value of the Fund will be potentially more volatile and all other risks will tend\nto be compounded. This is because leverage generally creates investment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than the Fund would otherwise have and so magnifies the effect of any increase or decrease in the\nvalue of the Fund's underlying assets. The use of leverage is considered to be a speculative investment\npractice and may result in losses to the Fund. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss,\nregardless of the size of the initial investment. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy repayment, interest payment, or margin\nobligations. Commodity-Linked Derivative Tax Risk. To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax\ntreatment accorded to RICs, the Fund must, among other things, derive in each taxable year at least 90% of\nits gross income from certain prescribed sources. The Fund generally intends to invest in commodity-linked\nderivative instruments indirectly through the Subsidiary. The Fund's investment in the Subsidiary is\nexpected to provide the Fund with exposure to the commodities markets within the limitations of the federal\ntax requirements of the Code for qualification as a RIC. The Adviser intends to conduct the Fund's\ninvestments in the Subsidiary in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of the regulations\npromulgated by the U.S. Treasury, and will monitor the Fund's investments in the Subsidiary to ensure that\nno more than 25% of the Fund's assets are invested in the Subsidiary. The Fund may also obtain exposure to\nthe commodities markets by directly entering into commodity-linked derivative instruments, such as listed\nfutures contracts and swaps. Income from certain commodity-linked derivative instruments in which the Fund\ninvests might not be considered qualifying income under the 90% test 12 noted above. To the extent the Fund\nmakes a direct investment in commodity-linked derivative instruments, it will seek to restrict the resulting\nincome from such instruments so that, when combined with its other non-qualifying income, the Fund's non-\nqualifying income is less than 10% of its gross income. However, the Fund may generate more non-qualifying\nincome than anticipated, may not be able to generate qualifying income in a particular taxable year at\nlevels sufficient to meet the 90% test noted above, or may not be able to accurately predict the non-\nqualifying income from these investments. Failure to comply with this restriction would have significant\nnegative tax consequences to Fund shareholders. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts\nRisk . The net asset value of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of the\nFund's holdings. The market prices of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nFund's net asset value and supply and demand of Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be predicted whether\nFund Shares will trade below, at or above their net asset value. Price differences may be due, in large\npart, to the fact that supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for Fund Shares will\nbe closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the securities of the\nIndex trading individually or in the aggregate at any point in time. The market prices of Fund Shares may\ndeviate significantly from the net asset value of Fund Shares during periods of market volatility. However,\ngiven that Fund Shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units (unlike shares of many closed-end\nfunds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their net asset\nvalue), the Adviser believes that large discounts or premiums to the net asset value of Fund Shares should\nnot be sustained over long periods. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it likely that\nFund Shares normally will trade close to the Fund's net asset value, disruptions to creations and\nredemptions or market volatility may result in trading prices that differ significantly from the Fund's net\nasset value. If an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time when the market price is at a premium to the net\nasset value of Fund Shares or sells at a time when the market price is at a discount to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares, then the investor may sustain losses. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk . The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities and/or other instruments. The Fund will seek to provide investment results that correspond\ngenerally to the performance of the Index, regardless of the current or projected performance of the Index\nor of the actual securities and/or other instruments comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-\nmanaged fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. The Fund generally will buy and will\nnot sell a security and/or other instrument as long as the security and/or other instrument is intended to\nassist the Fund in tracking the performance of the Index regardless of any sudden or material decline in\nvalue or foreseeable material decline in value of the security and/or other instrument, even though the\nAdviser may make a different investment decision for other actively managed accounts or portfolios that hold\nthe security and/or other instrument. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less favorable than that of\na portfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The structure and composition of the Index will\naffect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index (in absolute terms and by comparison with other\nindices) and, consequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have\nan adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time, investments\nthat do not align with the Index's objective and/or criteria. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index (i.e., achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), the Fund's return may\nnot match the return of the Index for a number of reasons. The Fund incurs a number of operating expenses\nnot applicable to the Index, and incurs costs in buying and selling securities and/or other instruments. In\naddition, the Fund may not be fully invested at times, either as a result of cash flows into or out of the\nFund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track the Index\nreturn by investing in fewer than all of the securities and/or other instruments in the Index, or in some\nsecurities and/or instruments not included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's return and that of the Index. Changes in the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact the Fund's ability to match the return of the Index. The Adviser may apply one\nor more \u201cscreens\u201d or investment techniques to refine or limit the number or types of issuers included in the\nIndex in which the Fund may invest. Application of such screens or techniques may result in investment\nperformance below that of the Index and may not produce results expected by the Adviser. Index tracking risk\nmay be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. 13\nPursuant to the Index methodology, a security and/or other instrument may be removed from the Index in the\nevent that it does not comply with the eligibility requirements of the Index. As a result, the Fund may be\nforced to sell investments at inopportune times and/or unfavorable prices due to these changes in the Index\ncomponents. When there are changes made to the component securities and/or other instruments of the Index\nand the Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between\nthe Fund's portfolio and the Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled changes to the Index may expose\nthe Fund to additional tracking error risk. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or\nreconstituting its holdings to reflect changes in the securities and/or other instruments included in the\nIndex. The Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains to its shareholders to avoid adverse\nfederal income tax consequences. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk that the Fund may not be able\nto dispose of investments readily at a favorable time or prices (or at all) or at prices approximating those\nat which the Fund currently values them. For example, certain investments may be subject to restrictions on\nresale, may trade in the over-the-counter market or in limited volume, or may not have an active trading\nmarket. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value. It may be difficult for the Fund to value illiquid investments\naccurately. The market for certain investments may become illiquid under adverse market or economic\nconditions independent of any specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer. If the\nliquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market price of Fund\nShares and the net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nDisposal of illiquid investments may entail registration expenses and other transaction costs that are\nhigher than those for liquid investments. The Fund may seek to borrow money to meet its obligations\n(including among other things redemption obligations) if it is unable to dispose of illiquid investments,\nresulting in borrowing expenses and possible leveraging of the Fund. Market Risk . Market prices of\ninvestments held by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The Fund's investments\nare subject to changes in general economic conditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in\ninvestment in securities or commodities markets. Investment markets can be volatile, and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors, including, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers and general market liquidity. Even if general economic conditions do not change, the value of an\ninvestment in the Fund could decline if the particular industries, sectors or companies in which the Fund\ninvests do not perform well or are adversely affected by events. Further, legal, political, regulatory and\ntax changes also may cause fluctuations in markets and investment prices. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments. A widespread outbreak of an infectious\nillness, such as COVID-19, and efforts to contain its spread, may result in market volatility, inflation,\nreduced liquidity of certain instruments, disruption in the trading of certain instruments, and systemic\neconomic weakness. The foregoing could impact the Fund and its investments and result in disruptions to the\nservices provided to the Fund by its service providers. Additionally, in March 2023, the shutdown of certain\nfinancial institutions raised economic concerns over disruption in the U.S. banking system. There can be no\ncertainty that the actions taken by the U.S. government to strengthen public confidence in the U.S. banking\nsystem will be effective in mitigating the effects of financial institution failures on the economy and\nrestoring public confidence in the U.S. banking system. Money Market Fund Investment Risk . An investment in\na money market fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other\ngovernment agency. Certain money market funds seek to preserve the value of their shares at $1.00 per share,\nalthough there can be no assurance that they will do so, and it is possible to lose money by investing in\nsuch a money market fund. A major or unexpected change in interest rates or a decline in the credit quality\nof an issuer or entity providing credit support, an inactive trading market for money market instruments, or\nadverse market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions could cause\nthe share price of such a money market fund to fall below $1.00. It is possible that such a money market\nfund will issue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at times when the fair value of the money market fund's\nportfolio per share is more or less than $1.00. None of State Street Corporation, State Street Bank and\nTrust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d), State Street Global Advisors (\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates\n(collectively, the \u201cState Street Entities\u201d) guarantee the value of an investment in a money market fund at\n$1.00 per share. Investors should have no expectation of capital support to a money market fund from the\nState Street Entities. Other money market funds price and transact 14 at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV that will\nfluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Shares sold utilizing a floating NAV\nmay be worth more or less than their original purchase price. Recent changes in the regulation of money\nmarket funds may affect the operations and structures of money market funds. A money market fund may be\npermitted or required to impose redemption fees during times of market stress. New Fund Risk . The Fund is\nnew and there is no assurance that the Fund will grow quickly. When the Fund's size is small, the Fund may\nexperience low trading volume, which could lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the\nrisk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could cause elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences\nfor its shareholders. Non-Diversification Risk . As a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold a smaller\nnumber of investments than many other funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small number of\nissuers, a decline in the market value of a particular investment held by the Fund may affect its value more\nthan if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the\nvalues of shares of more diversified funds. The Fund may become diversified for periods of time solely as a\nresult of tracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component securities and/or other\ninstruments). Subsidiary Investment Risk . The Fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in the\nSubsidiary without violating tax diversification rules applicable to RICs. By investing in the Subsidiary,\nthe Fund is indirectly exposed to the risks associated with the Subsidiary's investments. The Subsidiary is\nnot registered under 1940 Act and is therefore not subject to all of the investor protections of the 1940\nAct. Thus, the Fund, as an investor in the Subsidiary, will not have all of the protections offered to\ninvestors in registered investment companies. In addition, changes in the laws of the United States and/or\nthe Cayman Islands could result in the inability the Fund to operate as intended and could negatively affect\nthe Fund and its shareholders. U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk . U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from\nother securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Similar\nto other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S. government may cause the\nvalue of the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. The total public debt of the United States as a\npercentage of gross domestic product grew rapidly after the financial crisis of 2008 and has remained at a\nhistorically high level. Although high debt levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems,\nthey may create certain systemic risks if sound debt management practices are not implemented. A high\nnational debt level may increase market pressures to meet government funding needs, which may drive debt\ncost higher and cause a country to sell additional debt, thereby increasing refinancing risk. A high\nnational debt also raises concerns that a government will not be able to make principal or interest payments\nwhen they are due. In the worst case, unsustainable debt levels can cause a decline in the value of the\ndollar (which may lead to inflation), and can prevent the U.S. government from implementing effective\ncountercyclical fiscal policy in economic downturns. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services\ndowngraded U.S. Treasury securities from AAA rating to AA+ rating. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services stated\nthat its decision was prompted by its view on the rising public debt burden and its perception of greater\npolicymaking uncertainty. Fitch also downgraded its rating of U.S. Treasury securities from AAA to AA+ in\nAugust 2023, citing increasing government debt and erosion in confidence regarding governance of fiscal\nmatters as a result of repeated political standoffs related to debt limit approvals. A downgrade of the\nratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing\narrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and corporate borrowers, cause\ndisruptions in the international bond markets and have a substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy.\nAny additional downgrades of U.S. Treasury securities from ratings agencies may cause the value of the\nFund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. In recent years, impasses in Congress regarding the federal\nbudget have caused temporary Federal government shutdowns. While Congress has temporarily suspended the debt\nlimit from time to time, the risks that the U.S. government will not adopt a long-term budget or deficit\nreduction plan, of one or more additional Federal government shutdowns or of future failures to not increase\nthe Federal government's debt limit, may affect investor and consumer confidence and may adversely impact\nfinancial markets and the broader economy, perhaps suddenly and to a significant degree. Valuation Risk .\nSome portfolio holdings, potentially a large portion of the Fund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market turmoil or\nreduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not 15 readily available. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including\n\u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next\nthan if market quotations were used. Technological issues or other service disruption issues involving\nthird-party service providers may cause the Fund to value its investments incorrectly. In addition, there is\nno assurance that the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that time. Non-Principal Risks Authorized\nParticipants, Market Makers and Liquidity Providers Concentration Risk. The Fund has a limited number of\nfinancial institutions that may act as Authorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d), which are responsible for the\ncreation and redemption activity for the Fund. In addition, there may be a limited number of market makers\nand/or liquidity providers in the marketplace. To the extent either of the following events occur, Fund\nShares may trade at a material discount to NAV and possibly face delisting: (i) APs exit the business or\notherwise become unable to process creation and/or redemption orders and no other APs step forward to\nperform these services, or (ii) market makers and/or liquidity providers exit the business or significantly\nreduce their business activities and no other entities step forward to perform their functions.\nConcentration Risk . The Fund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group of industries, but only\nto the extent that the Fund's underlying Index concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries.\nWhen the Fund focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector, financial, economic, business, and\nother developments affecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic sector will have a greater effect\non the Fund than if it had not focused its assets in that industry, market, or economic sector, which may\nincrease the volatility of the Fund. Conflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in the Fund will be subject\nto a number of actual or potential conflicts of interest. For example, the Adviser or its affiliates may\nprovide services to the Fund, such as securities lending agency services, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer agency and shareholder servicing, securities brokerage\nservices, and other services for which the Fund would compensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates. The\nFund may invest in other pooled investment vehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates at which the Fund pays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its\naffiliates, or the terms on which it enters into transactions with the Adviser or its affiliates will be the\nmost favorable available in the market generally or as favorable as the rates the Adviser or its affiliates\nmake available to other clients. Because of its financial interest, the Adviser will have an incentive to\nenter into transactions or arrangements on behalf of the Fund with itself or its affiliates in circumstances\nwhere it might not have done so in the absence of that interest, provided that the Adviser will comply with\napplicable regulatory requirements. The Adviser and its affiliates serve as investment adviser to other\nclients and may make investment decisions that may be different from those that will be made by the Adviser\non behalf of the Fund. For example, the Adviser may provide asset allocation advice to some clients that may\ninclude a recommendation to invest in or redeem from particular issuers while not providing that same\nrecommendation to all clients invested in the same or similar issuers. The Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to purchase (or sell) investments for the Fund and to sell (or\npurchase) the same investment for accounts, funds, or structured products for which it serves as asset\nmanager, or for other clients or affiliates. The Adviser and its affiliates may invest for clients in\nvarious securities that are senior, pari passu or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to,\nthe securities that are owned by the Fund. The Adviser or its affiliates, in connection with its other\nbusiness activities, may acquire material nonpublic confidential information that may restrict the Adviser\nfrom purchasing securities or selling securities for itself or its clients (including the Fund) or otherwise\nusing such information for the benefit of its clients or itself. The foregoing does not purport to be a\ncomprehensive list or complete explanation of all potential conflicts of interests which may affect the\nFund. The Fund may encounter circumstances, or enter into transactions, in which conflicts of interest that\nare not listed or discussed above may arise. Costs of Buying and Selling Shares . Investors buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by\nbrokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a\nsignificant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of Fund Shares.\nIn addition, secondary market investors will also incur the cost of the difference between the 16 price that\nan investor is willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at which an investor is\nwilling to sell Fund Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price). This difference in bid and ask prices is often referred to as\nthe \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cbid/ask spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time for Fund Shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if Fund Shares have more trading volume and market\nliquidity and higher if Fund Shares have little trading volume and market liquidity. Further, increased\nmarket volatility may cause increased bid/ask spreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling Fund Shares,\nincluding bid/ask spreads, frequent trading of Fund Shares may significantly reduce investment results and\nan investment in Fund Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small\ninvestments. Cybersecurity Risk . With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the\ndependence on computer systems to perform business and operational functions, funds (such as the Fund) and\ntheir service providers (including the Adviser) may be prone to operational and information security risks\nresulting from cyber-attacks and/or technological malfunctions. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions may have\nincreased the scale and sophistication of deliberate cybersecurity attacks, particularly those from nation-\nstates or from entities with nation-state backing. In general, cyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects. Cyber-attacks include, among others, stealing or corrupting\ndata maintained online or digitally, preventing legitimate users from accessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information without authorization, and causing operational disruption.\nSuccessful cyber-attacks against, or security breakdowns of, the Fund, the Adviser or a custodian, transfer\nagent, or other affiliated or third-party service provider may adversely affect the Fund or its\nshareholders. For instance, cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may interfere with the processing of\nshareholder or other transactions, affect the Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the release of\nprivate shareholder information or confidential Fund information, impede trading, cause reputational damage,\nand subject the Fund to regulatory fines, penalties or financial losses, reimbursement or other compensation\ncosts, and additional compliance costs. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may render records of Fund\nassets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and other data integral to the functioning of\nthe Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. The Fund may also incur substantial costs for\ncybersecurity risk management in order to prevent cyber incidents in the future. The Fund and its\nshareholders could be negatively impacted as a result. While the Adviser has established a business\ncontinuity plan and systems designed to minimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the use of technology,\nprocesses and controls, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility\nthat certain risks have not been identified, given the evolving nature of this threat. The Fund relies on\nthird-party service providers for many of its day-to-day operations, and will be subject to the risk that\nthe protections and protocols implemented by those service providers will be ineffective to protect the Fund\nfrom cyber-attack. The Adviser does not control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by third-\nparty service providers, and such third-party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations\nto the Adviser or the Fund. Similar types of cybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions also are present\nfor issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for\nsuch issuers, and may cause the Fund's investment in such securities to lose value. Index Construction Risk\n. A security and/or instrument included in the Index may not exhibit the characteristic or provide the\nspecific exposure for which it was selected and consequently the Fund's holdings may not exhibit returns\nconsistent with that characteristic or exposure. Index Licensing Risk . It is possible that the license\nunder which the Adviser or the Fund is permitted to replicate or otherwise use the Index will be terminated\nor may be disputed, impaired or cease to remain in effect. In such a case, the Adviser may be required to\nreplace the Index with another index which it considers to be appropriate in light of the investment\nstrategy of the Fund. The use of any such substitute index may have an adverse impact on the Fund's\nperformance. In the event that the Adviser is unable to identify a suitable replacement for the Index, it\nmay determine to terminate the Fund. Portfolio Turnover Risk . The Fund may engage in frequent trading of\nits portfolio holdings. Fund turnover generally involves a number of direct and indirect costs and expenses\nto the Fund, including, for example, brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of investments and reinvestment in other securities and/or other instruments.\nThe costs related to increased portfolio turnover have the effect of reducing the Fund's investment return,\nand the sale of portfolio holdings by the Fund may result in the 17 realization of taxable capital gains,\nincluding short-term capital gains. The Fund may engage in significant trading of its portfolio holdings in\nconnection with Index rebalancing. Frequent or significant trading may cause the Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax consequences in comparison to an ETF that does not engage in\nfrequent or significant trading. Regulatory Risk. Governmental and regulatory actions may have unexpected or\nadverse consequences on particular markets, strategies, or investments, which may adversely impact the Fund\nand impair how it is managed. Policy and legislative changes in the United States and in other countries may\naffect aspects of financial regulation, and may in some instances contribute to decreased liquidity and\nincreased volatility in the financial markets. The impact of these changes on the markets, and the practical\nimplications for market participants, may not be fully known for some time. Securities Lending Risk. The\nFund may lend portfolio securities in an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For these\npurposes, net assets shall exclude the value of all assets received as collateral for the loan. Such loans\nmay be terminated at any time. Any such loans must be continuously secured by collateral maintained on a\ncurrent basis in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned by the Fund, marked\nto market each trading day. The Fund will receive the amount of all dividends, interest and other\ndistributions on the loaned securities; however, the borrower has the right to vote the loaned securities.\nThe Fund will call loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the investment is to be voted upon.\nEfforts to recall such securities promptly may be unsuccessful, especially for foreign securities or thinly\ntraded securities. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. Should the borrower of\nthe securities fail financially, the Fund may experience delays in recovering the securities or exercising\nits rights in the collateral. Loans are made only to borrowers that are deemed by the securities lending\nagent to be of good financial standing. In a loan transaction, the Fund will also bear the risk of any\ndecline in value of securities provided as collateral or acquired with cash collateral. The Fund will\nattempt to minimize this risk by limiting the investment of cash collateral to high quality instruments of\nshort maturity either directly on behalf of the lending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or funds,\nwhich may include those managed by the Adviser. To the extent the collateral provided or investments made\nwith cash collateral differ from securities included in the Index, such collateral or investments may have a\ngreater risk of loss than the securities included in the Index. In addition, the Fund will be subject to the\nrisk that any income generated by lending its securities or reinvesting cash collateral is lower than any\nfees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower. The Adviser will take into account the tax impact to\nshareholders of substitute payments for dividends when overseeing the Fund's securities lending activity.\nTrading Issues . Although Fund Shares are listed for trading on the Exchange and may be listed or traded on\nU.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the Exchange, there can be no assurance that an active trading\nmarket for the Fund Shares will develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund Shares on the Exchange may be\nhalted due to market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in Fund\nShares inadvisable. In addition, trading in Fund Shares on the Exchange is subject to trading halts caused\nby extraordinary market volatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d rules. Similar to the shares of\noperating companies listed on a stock exchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and are therefore subject to\nthe risk of increased volatility in the trading price of the Fund's shares. While the Fund expects that the\nability of Authorized Participants to create and redeem Fund Shares at net asset value should be effective\nin reducing any such volatility, there is no guarantee that it will eliminate the volatility associated with\nsuch short sales. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to maintain the\nlisting of the Fund will continue to be met or will remain unchanged or that Fund Shares will trade with any\nvolume, or at all, on any stock exchange. Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment\nadviser to the Fund and, subject to the oversight of the Board, is responsible for the investment management\nof the Fund. The Adviser provides an investment management program for the Fund and manages the investment\nof the Fund's assets. In addition, the Adviser will provide administrative, compliance and general\nmanagement services to the Fund. The Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Global Advisors,\nInc., which is itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Corporation. The Adviser is registered with\nthe SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Adviser is also registered with the U.S.\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission as a commodity pool operator. The Adviser and certain other affiliates\nof State Street 18\n\nCorporation make up SSGA. SSGA is one of the world's largest institutional money managers and the investment\nmanagement arm of State Street Corporation. As of June 30, 2024, the Adviser managed approximately $1.01\ntrillion in assets and SSGA managed approximately $4.13 trillion in assets. The Adviser's principal business\naddress is One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. For the services provided to the Fund under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, the Fund expects to pay the Adviser the annual fee based on a percentage of\nthe Fund's average daily net assets as set forth below:\n                                                       \n  SPDR Bloomberg Enhanced Roll Yield Commodity  0.28%  \n  Strategy No K-1 ETF                                  \n                                                       \nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all or a portion of its management fee. The Adviser pays all\nexpenses of the Fund other than the management fee, acquired fund fees and expenses associated with holdings\nof acquired funds for cash management purposes, brokerage expenses, taxes, interest, fees and expenses of\nthe Independent Trustees (including any Trustee's counsel fees), litigation expenses, acquired fund fees and\nexpenses and other extraordinary expenses. A summary of the factors considered by the Board in connection\nwith the initial approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement for the Fund will be available in the Fund's\nForm N-CSR filing with the SEC for the period ended October 31, 2024. SSGA FM, as the investment adviser for\nthe Fund, may hire one or more sub-advisers to oversee the day-to-day investment activities of the Fund. The\nsub-advisers are subject to oversight by the Adviser. The Adviser and SPDR Series Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) have\nreceived an exemptive order from the SEC that permits the Adviser, with the approval of the Board, including\na majority of the Independent Trustees, of the Trust, to retain and amend existing sub-advisory agreements\nwith unaffiliated investment sub-advisers for the Fund without submitting the sub-advisory agreement to a\nvote of the Fund's shareholders. The Trust will notify shareholders in the event of any change in the\nidentity of such sub-adviser or sub-advisers. The Adviser has ultimate responsibility for the investment\nperformance of the Fund due to its responsibility to oversee each sub-adviser and recommend their hiring,\ntermination and replacement. The Adviser is not required to disclose fees paid to any unaffiliated sub-\nadviser retained pursuant to the order. The Subsidiary. The Fund expects to gain exposure to commodity-\nlinked derivative instruments by investing in the Subsidiary, a wholly-owned, exempted limited company\norganized under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The Subsidiary is overseen by its own board of directors.\nThe Adviser serves as the Subsidiary's investment adviser and manages the Subsidiary to comply with the\ncompliance policies and procedures of the Fund. Portfolio Managers.\nThe Fund is managed using a team of investment professionals. The team approach is used to create an\nenvironment that encourages the flow of investment ideas. The portfolio managers within the team work\ntogether in a cohesive manner to develop and enhance techniques that drive the investment process for the\ninvestment strategy. This approach requires portfolio managers to share a variety of responsibilities\nincluding investment strategy and analysis while retaining responsibility for the implementation of the\nstrategy within any particular portfolio. The approach also enables the team to draw upon the resources of\nother groups within SSGA. The portfolio management team is overseen by the SSGA Investment Committee.

Additional Purchase and Sale Information Fund Shares are listed for secondary trading on\nthe Exchange and individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold in the secondary market through a\nbroker-dealer. The secondary markets are closed on weekends and also are generally closed on the following\nholidays: New Year's Day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Juneteenth National Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and\nChristmas Day. The Exchange may close early on the business day before certain holidays and on the day after\nThanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules are subject to change without notice. If you buy or sell Fund\nShares in the secondary market, you will pay the secondary market price for Fund Shares. In addition, you\nmay incur customary brokerage commissions and charges and may pay some or all of the spread between the bid\nand the offered price in the secondary market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction.\nThe trading prices of Fund Shares will fluctuate continuously throughout trading hours based on market\nsupply and demand rather than the Fund's net asset value, which is calculated at the end of each business\nday. Fund Shares will trade on the Exchange at prices that may be above ( i.e ., at a premium) or below (\ni.e ., at a discount), to varying degrees, the daily net asset value of Fund Shares. The trading prices of\nFund Shares may deviate significantly from the Fund's net asset value during periods of market volatility.\nGiven, however, that Fund Shares can be issued and redeemed daily in Creation Units, the Adviser believes\nthat large discounts and premiums to net asset value should not be sustained over long periods. 21 The\nExchange will disseminate, every fifteen seconds during the regular trading day, an indicative optimized\nportfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d) relating to the Fund. The IOPV calculations are estimates of the value of the\nFund's net asset value per Fund Share. Premiums and discounts between the IOPV and the market price may\noccur. This should not be viewed as a \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net asset value per Fund Share. The IOPV is\nbased on the current market value of the published basket of portfolio securities and/or cash required to be\ndeposited in exchange for a Creation Unit and does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the\nFund's actual portfolio at a particular point in time. Moreover, the IOPV is generally determined by using\ncurrent market quotations and/or price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market\nintermediaries and valuations based on current market rates. The IOPV may not be calculated in the same\nmanner as the NAV, which (i) is computed only once a day, (ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be subject, in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act,\nto fair valuation at different prices than those used in the calculations of the IOPV. When applicable, the\nIOPV price is based on quotes and closing prices from the securities' local market converted into U.S.\ndollars at the current currency rates and may not reflect events that occur subsequent to the local market's\nclose. Therefore, the IOPV may not reflect the best possible valuation of the Fund's current portfolio.\nNeither the Fund nor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the\ncalculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and make no warranty as to their accuracy. The Fund does not\nimpose any restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions; however, the Fund reserves the right\nto reject or limit purchases at any time as described in the SAI. When considering that no restriction or\npolicy was necessary, the Board evaluated the risks posed by market timing activities, such as whether\nfrequent purchases and redemptions would interfere with the efficient implementation of the Fund's\ninvestment strategy, or whether they would cause the Fund to experience increased transaction costs. The\nBoard considered that, unlike traditional mutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and redeemed only in large\nquantities of shares known as Creation Units, available only from the Fund directly, and that most trading\nin the Fund occurs on the Exchange at prevailing market prices and does not involve the Fund directly. Given\nthis structure, the Board determined that it is unlikely that (a) market timing would be attempted by the\nFund's shareholders or (b) any attempts to market time the Fund by shareholders would result in negative\nimpact to the Fund or its shareholders. Distributions Dividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund shareholder,\nyou are entitled to your share of the Fund's income and net realized gains on its investments. The Fund pays\nout substantially all of its net earnings to its shareholders as \u201cdistributions.\u201d The Fund may earn income\ndividends from stocks, interest from debt securities and, if participating, securities lending income. These\namounts, net of expenses and taxes (if applicable), are passed along to Fund shareholders as \u201cincome\ndividend distributions.\u201d The Fund will generally realize short-term capital gains or losses whenever it\nsells or exchanges assets held for one year or less. Net short-term capital gains will generally be treated\nas ordinary income when distributed to shareholders. The Fund will generally realize long-term capital gains\nor losses whenever it sells or exchanges assets held for more than one year. Net capital gains (the excess\nof the Fund's net long-term capital gains over its net short-term capital losses) are distributed to\nshareholders as \u201ccapital gain distributions.\u201d Income dividend distributions, if any, are generally\ndistributed to shareholders annually, but may vary significantly from period to period. Net capital gains\nfor the Fund are distributed at least annually. Dividends may be declared and paid more frequently or at any\nother time to improve Index tracking or to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code.\nDistributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole Fund Shares only if the broker\nthrough whom you purchased Fund Shares makes such option available. Distributions which are reinvested will\nnevertheless be taxable to the same extent as if such distributions had not been reinvested. Portfolio\nHoldings Disclosure The Fund's portfolio holdings disclosure policy is described in the SAI. In addition,\nthe identities and quantities of the securities held by the Fund are disclosed on the Fund's website. 22\nAdditional Tax Information The following discussion is a summary of some important U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations generally applicable to an investment in the Fund. Your investment in the Fund may have other\ntax implications. Please consult your tax advisor about federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws\napplicable to you. Investors, including non-U.S. investors, may wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. The Fund has elected or will elect to be a RIC and intends to qualify each year to be\ntreated as such. A RIC is generally not subject to tax at the corporate level on income and gains that are\ndistributed to shareholders. However, the Fund's failure to qualify for treatment as a RIC may result in\ncorporate level taxation, and consequently, a reduction in income available for distribution to\nshareholders. Taxes On Distributions. In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when\nthey are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. The income dividends and short-\nterm capital gains distributions you receive from the Fund will generally be taxed as ordinary income. Any\ndistributions of the Fund's net capital gains are taxable as long-term capital gain regardless of how long\nyou have owned Fund Shares. Long-term capital gains are generally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at\nreduced rates. Distributions in excess of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits are\ntreated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Fund's shares, and, in general,\nas capital gain thereafter. U.S. individuals with income exceeding specified thresholds are subject to a\n3.8% Medicare contribution tax on all or a portion of their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which includes taxable\ninterest, dividends and certain capital gains (generally including capital gain distributions and capital\ngains realized upon the sale of Fund Shares). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of the\nundistributed net investment income of certain shareholders that are estates and trusts. Certain tax-exempt\neducational institutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on net investment income. For these purposes, certain\ndividends and capital gain distributions, and certain gains from the disposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken into account in computing a shareholder's net investment income.\nDistributions paid in January, but declared by the Fund in October, November or December of the previous\nyear, payable to shareholders of record in such a month, may be taxable to you in the calendar year in which\nthey were declared. The Fund will inform you of the amount of your ordinary income dividends and capital\ngain distributions shortly after the close of each calendar year. A distribution will reduce the Fund's net\nasset value per Fund Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an\ninvestment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. . Original Issue Discount .\nInvestments by the Fund in zero coupon or other discount securities will result in income to the Fund equal\nto a portion of the excess face value of the securities over their issue price (the \u201coriginal issue\ndiscount\u201d or \u201cOID\u201d) each year that the securities are held, even though the Fund may receive no cash\ninterest payments or may receive cash interest payments that are less than the income recognized for tax\npurposes. In other circumstances, whether pursuant to the terms of a security or as a result of other\nfactors outside the control of the Fund, the Fund may recognize income without receiving a commensurate\namount of cash. The Fund's share of such income is included in determining the amount that the Fund must\ndistribute to maintain its eligibility for treatment as a RIC and to avoid the payment of federal tax,\nincluding the nondeductible 4% excise tax. Because any income required to be recognized as a result of the\nOID and/or market discount rules (discussed below) may not be matched by a corresponding cash payment, the\nFund may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to be able to make distributions to its\nshareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a RIC and eliminate taxes at the Fund level. Inflation-\nIndexed Bonds. Special rules apply if the Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated interest\non inflation-indexed bonds is taken into income by the Fund under its regular method of accounting for\ninterest income. The amount of any positive inflation adjustment for a taxable year, which results from an\nincrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is treated as OID. The amount of the Fund's\nOID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will increase the Fund's taxable income for such year without a\ncorresponding receipt of cash until the bond matures. As a result, the Fund may need to use other sources of\ncash to satisfy its distribution requirements for such year. The amount of any negative inflation\nadjustments, which result from a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, first\nreduces the amount of interest (including stated interest, OID, and market discount, if any) 23 otherwise\nincludible in the Fund's income with respect to the bond for the taxable year; any remaining negative\nadjustments will be either treated as ordinary loss or, in certain circumstances, carried forward to reduce\nthe amount of interest income taken into account with respect to the bond in future taxable years. Market\nDiscount. Any market discount recognized on a market discount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market\ndiscount bond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or below adjusted\nissue price if the bond was issued with original issue discount. Absent an election by the Fund to include\nthe market discount in income as it accrues, the gain on the Fund's disposition of such an obligation will\nbe treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount. Where\nthe income required to be recognized as a result of the market discount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash receipt by the Fund, the Fund may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to\nenable the Fund to make distributions to its shareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a RIC and\neliminate taxes at the Fund level, potentially resulting in additional taxable gain or loss to the Fund.\nDerivatives and Other Complex Securities. The Fund may invest in complex securities. These investments may\nbe subject to numerous special and complex rules. These rules could affect whether gains and losses\nrecognized by the Fund are treated as ordinary income or capital gain, accelerate the recognition of income\nto the Fund and/or defer the Fund's ability to recognize losses. In turn, these rules may affect the amount,\ntiming or character of the income distributed to you by the Fund. You should consult your personal tax\nadvisor regarding the application of these rules. Index Concentration . In order to qualify for the\nfavorable tax treatment generally available to RICs, the Fund must satisfy certain diversification\nrequirements. In particular, the Fund generally may not acquire a security if, as a result of the\nacquisition, more than 50% of the value of the Fund's assets would be invested in (a) issuers in which the\nFund has, in each case, invested more than 5% of the Fund's assets and (b) issuers more than 10% of whose\noutstanding voting securities are owned by the Fund. The Fund's efforts to satisfy the diversification\nrequirements may affect the Fund's execution of its investment strategy and may cause the Fund's return to\ndeviate from that of the Index, and the Fund's efforts to track the Index may cause it inadvertently to fail\nto satisfy the diversification requirements. If the Fund were to fail to qualify as a RIC, it would be taxed\nin the same manner as an ordinary corporation, and distributions to its shareholders would not be deductible\nby the Fund in computing its taxable income. Taxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon a sale of Fund Shares is generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if Fund Shares\nhave been held for more than one year and as short-term capital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been held\nfor one year or less, except that any capital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held for six months or less is\ntreated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to the\nFund Shares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units. A person who exchanges securities for\nCreation Units generally will recognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss will be equal to the difference\nbetween the market value of the Creation Units at the time and the exchanger's aggregate basis in the\nsecurities surrendered plus any cash paid for the Creation Units. A person who exchanges Creation Units for\nsecurities will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the exchanger's basis in\nthe Creation Units and the aggregate market value of the securities and the amount of cash received. The\nInternal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), however, may assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units cannot be deducted currently under the rules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on the\nbasis that there has been no significant change in economic position. Persons exchanging securities should\nconsult their own tax advisor with respect to whether wash sale rules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. Under current federal tax laws, any capital gain or loss realized upon a redemption (or\ncreation) of Creation Units is generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for more than one year and as a short-term capital gain or loss if\nthe Fund Shares (or securities surrendered) have been held for one year or less. If you create or redeem\nCreation Units, you will be sent a confirmation statement showing how many Fund Shares you purchased or sold\nand at what price. The Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has the right to reject an order for Creation Units if\nthe purchaser (or a group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more\nof the outstanding shares of the Fund and if, pursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the Fund would have a\nbasis in the securities different from the 24 market value of the securities on the date of deposit. The\nTrust also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for\npurposes of the 80% determination. If the Trust does issue Creation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares\nof the Fund, the purchaser (or group of purchasers) will not recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units. If the Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear additional costs and\nrecognize more capital gains than it would if it redeems Creation Units in-kind. Investments In Certain\nForeign Corporations. The Fund may invest in foreign entities classified as passive foreign investment\ncompanies or \u201cPFICs\u201d or controlled foreign corporations or \u201cCFCs\u201d under the Code. PFIC and CFC investments\nare subject to complex rules that may under certain circumstances adversely affect the Fund. Accordingly,\ninvestors should consult their own tax advisors and carefully consider the tax consequences of PFIC and CFC\ninvestments by the Fund before making an investment in theFund. The Fund's dividends attributable to\ndividends received from PFICs and certain CFCs generally will not be treated as qualified dividend income.\nAdditional information pertaining to the potential tax consequences to the Fund, and to the shareholders,\nfrom the Fund's potential investment in PFICs and CFCs can be found in the SAI. As discussed above, to\nqualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment accorded to RICs, the Fund must, among other\nthings, derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from certain prescribed sources\n(\u201cqualifying income\u201d). Very generally, income from commodities is not thought to be qualifying income for\npurposes of this requirement. The Fund invests a portion of its assets (not to exceed 25% of its assets) in\nthe Subsidiary, which is classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because the\nSubsidiary is a foreign corporation that is wholly owned by the Fund, the Subsidiary is a CFC. Because the\nSubsidiary is a CFC, the Fund is required to include in its gross income each taxable year all the\nSubsidiary's \u201csubpart F income.\u201d Under applicable regulations, the Fund's subpart F income inclusions will\nconstitute qualifying income for the Fund, whether or not any amount is distributed by the Subsidiary to the\nFund, if the subpart F income inclusions are derived with respect to the Fund's business of investing in\nstock, securities or currencies. It is possible that the IRS might take the position that subpart F income\ninclusions from the Subsidiary are not qualifying income. Under those circumstances the Fund might fail to\nqualify for treatment as a RIC. Additional information pertaining to the potential tax consequences to the\nFund, and to the shareholders, from the Fund's potential investment in the Subsidiary can be found in the\nSAI. Non-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income dividends paid by the Fund to shareholders who are non-resident\naliens or foreign entities will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (other than distributions\nreported by the Fund as interest-related dividends and short-term capital gain dividends), unless a lower\ntreaty rate applies or unless such income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. In\ngeneral, the Fund may report interest-related dividends to the extent of its net income derived from U.S.\nsource interest, and the Fund may report short-term capital gain dividends to the extent its net short-term\ncapital gain for the taxable year exceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains on the sale of Fund Shares\nand dividends that are, in each case, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within\nthe U.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal net income taxation at regular income tax rates. Non-U.S.\nshareholders that own, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the Fund's shares are urged to consult their\nown tax advisors concerning special tax rules that may apply to their investment. Unless certain non-U.S.\nentities that hold Fund Shares comply with IRS requirements that will generally require them to report\ninformation regarding U.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts with, such entities, a 30% withholding\ntax may apply to distributions payable to such entities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the\nwithholding described in this paragraph under an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and\na foreign government, provided that the shareholder and the applicable foreign government comply with the\nterms of such agreement. Backup Withholding. The Fund will be required in certain cases to withhold (as\n\u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund either an\nincorrect tax identification number or no number at all, (2) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for\nfailure to properly report payments of interest or dividends, (3) has failed to certify to the Fund that\nsuch shareholder is not subject to backup withholding, or (4) has not certified that such shareholder is a\nU.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently 24%. Backup\nwithholding will not be applied to payments that have been subject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor permanent residents of the United States. 25 Other Tax Issues. The\nFund may be subject to tax in certain states where the Fund does business (or is treated as doing business\nas a result of its investments). Furthermore, in those states which have income tax laws, the tax treatment\nof the Fund and of Fund shareholders with respect to distributions by the Fund may differ from federal tax\ntreatment. The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current federal income tax law\nof an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. Consult your personal tax\nadvisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in the Fund under all applicable tax laws.\nGeneral Information The Trust was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998. If\nshareholders of the Fund are required to vote on any matters, shareholders are entitled to one vote for each\nFund Share they own. Annual meetings of shareholders will not be held except as required by the 1940 Act and\nother applicable law. See the SAI for more information concerning the Trust's form of organization.\nManagement and Organization The Fund is a separate series of the Trust, which is an open-end registered\nmanagement investment company. From time to time, the Fund may advertise yield and total return figures.\nYield is a historical measure of dividend income, and total return is a measure of past dividend income\n(assuming that it has been reinvested) plus capital appreciation. Neither yield nor total return should be\nused to predict the future performance of the Fund. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel to the\nTrust, including the Fund. Ernst & Young LLP serves as the independent registered public accounting firm and\nwill audit the Fund's financial statements annually. Financial Highlights The Fund had not commenced\noperations prior to the date of this Prospectus and, therefore, does not have financial information. 26\nWhere to Learn More About the Fund This Prospectus does not contain all the information included in the\nRegistration Statement filed with the SEC with respect to Fund Shares.

The\nTrust was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998 and the Fund was established on May\n16, 2024. The offering of the Fund's shares ( \u201c Shares \u201d ) is registered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c Securities Act \u201d ). The investment objective of the Fund is to provide investment results\nthat, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of a specified market\nindex (the \u201c Index \u201d ). SSGA Funds Management, Inc. serves as the investment adviser for the Fund ( \u201c SSGA\nFM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ). The Fund offers and issues Shares at their net asset value (sometimes referred to\nherein as \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in aggregations of a specified number of Shares (each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ). The\nFund generally offers and issues Shares in exchange for (i) a basket of securities designated by the Fund (\n\u201c Deposit Securities \u201d ) together with the deposit of a specified cash payment ( \u201c Cash Component \u201d ) or\n(ii) a cash payment equal in value to the Deposit Securities ( \u201c Deposit Cash \u201d ) together with the Cash\nComponent. The primary consideration accepted by the Fund (i.e., Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash) is set\nforth under \u201c Purchase and Redemption of Creation Units \u201d later in this SAI. The Trust reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace\nany Deposit Security and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in\nlieu of Deposit Cash (subject to applicable legal requirements). The Shares have been approved for listing\nand secondary trading on a national securities exchange (the \u201c Exchange \u201d ). The Shares will trade on the\nExchange at market prices. These prices may differ from the Shares' net asset values. The Shares are also\nredeemable only in Creation Unit aggregations, and generally in exchange for either (i) portfolio securities\nand a specified cash payment or (ii) cash (subject to applicable legal requirements). Shares may be issued\nin advance of receipt of Deposit Securities subject to various conditions including a requirement to\nmaintain on deposit with the Trust cash at least equal to a specified percentage of the market value of the\nmissing Deposit Securities as set forth in the Participant Agreement (as defined below). See \u201c Purchase and\nRedemption of Creation Units. \u201d The Trust may impose a transaction fee for each creation or redemption. In\nall cases, such fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission ( \u201c SEC \u201d ) applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities. In\naddition to the fixed creation or redemption transaction fee, an additional transaction fee of up to three\ntimes the fixed creation or redemption transaction fee and/or an additional variable charge may apply.\nInvestment Policies The Fund may invest in the following types of investments, consistent with its\ninvestment strategies and objective. Please see the Fund's Prospectus for additional information regarding\nits principal investment strategies. References to the \u201c Fund \u201d below should be read to also apply to the\nSubsidiary (defined herein) where the context requires. DIVERSIFICATION STATUS The Fund is classified as a \u201c\nnon-diversified \u201d investment company under the 1940 Act. A \u201c non-diversified \u201d classification means that the\nFund is not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the\nsecurities of a single issuer. This means that the Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the\nsecurities of a single issuer than a diversified fund. This may have an adverse effect on the Fund's\nperformance or subject the Fund's Shares to greater price volatility than more diversified investment\ncompanies. The Fund intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a \u201c regulated investment company \u201d ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and to relieve the Fund of any liability\nfor federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may severely limit the investment flexibility of\nthe Fund and may make it less likely that the Fund will meet its investment objective. USE OF A CAYMAN\nISLANDS ORGANIZED SUBSIDIARY The Fund invests a portion of its assets in a subsidiary organized in the\nCayman Islands (the \u201c Subsidiary \u201d ). The Fund is the sole shareholder of the Subsidiary, and it is not\nexpected that shares of the Subsidiary will be sold or offered to other investors. The Fund invests in the\nSubsidiary in order to indirectly gain exposure to the commodities within the limitations of Subchapter M of\nthe Code applicable to RICs. Subchapter M requires, among other things, that a fund derive at least\n\n3\n\n90% of gross income from dividends, interest, and gains from the sale of securities (typically referred to\nas \u201c qualifying income \u201d ). The Fund may not invest more than 25% of the value of its total assets in the\nSubsidiary at the end of every quarter of its taxable year. If the Fund's income from the Subsidiary is not\nqualifying income, the Fund could be unable to qualify as a RIC for one or more taxable years. The\nSubsidiary is a company organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands and overseen by its own board. While\nthe Subsidiary may be considered similar to an investment company, it is not registered under the 1940 Act\nand is not subject to all of the investor protection requirements of the 1940 Act and other U.S. statutes\nand regulations. Consequently, the Fund, as the sole shareholder of the Subsidiary, will not have all of the\nprotections afforded to investors in RICs. By investing in the Subsidiary, the Fund is indirectly exposed to\nthe risks associated with the Subsidiary's investments. SSGA FM is responsible for the Subsidiary's day-to-\nday business pursuant to an investment advisory services agreement between the Subsidiary and SSGA FM.\nTherefore, the Fund's ownership and control of the Subsidiary make it unlikely that the Subsidiary would\ntake any action contrary to the interests of the Fund or its shareholders. Under the investment advisory\nservices agreement with the Subsidiary, SSGA FM provides the Subsidiary with the same type of management\nservices, under substantially similar terms, as are provided to the Fund. The Subsidiary has entered into\nseparate contracts for the provision of custody, transfer agency, and accounting agent services with the\nsame or with affiliates of the same service providers that provide those services to the Fund. The\nSubsidiary is managed pursuant to compliance policies and procedures that are the same, in all material\nrespects, as the policies and procedures adopted by the Fund. In managing the Subsidiary's investment\nportfolio, and in adhering to the Fund's compliance policies and procedures, SSGA FM treats the assets of\nthe Subsidiary as if the assets were held directly by the Fund. SSGA FM also treats the assets of the\nSubsidiary as if the assets were held directly by the Fund with respect to its adherence to the Fund's\ninvestment policies and restrictions. The Trust's Chief Compliance Officer oversees implementation of the\nSubsidiary's policies and procedures, and makes periodic reports to the Trust's Board regarding the\nSubsidiary's compliance with its policies and procedures. The Fund and Subsidiary test for compliance with\ncertain investment restrictions on a consolidated basis. The financial information of the Subsidiary will be\nconsolidated in the Fund's financial statements, as contained within the Fund's Annual and Semi-Annual\nReports provided to shareholders. Changes in U.S. laws (where the Fund is organized) and/or the Cayman\nIslands (where the Subsidiary is organized), could prevent the Fund and/or the Subsidiary from operating as\ndescribed in the Fund's prospectus and this SAI and could negatively affect the Fund and its shareholders.\nThe Fund does not currently intend to create or acquire primary control of any entity which primarily\nengages in investment activities in securities or other assets, other than entities wholly-owned or\nmajority-owned by the Fund. COMMERCIAL PAPER Commercial paper consists of short-term, promissory notes\nissued by banks, corporations and other entities to finance short-term credit needs. These securities\ngenerally are discounted but sometimes may be interest bearing. COMMODITIES RELATED INVESTMENTS The Fund\nmay, directly or indirectly, purchase securities backed by physical commodities, including interests in\nexchange-traded investment trusts and other similar entities, the value of the shares of which relates\ndirectly to the value of physical commodities held by such entity. As an investor with exposure to such an\nentity, the Fund would indirectly bear its pro rata share of the entity's expenses, which may include\nstorage and other costs relating to the entity's investments in physical commodities. In addition, the Fund\nwill not qualify as a RIC for any taxable year in which more than 10% of its gross income consists of \u201c non-\nqualifying \u201d income, which includes gains from selling physical commodities (or options or futures contracts\nthereon unless the gain is realized from certain hedging transactions) and certain other non-passive income.\nThe Fund's investment in securities backed by, or in such entities that invest in, physical commodities,\nother than shares of the Subsidiary, would produce non-qualifying income, although investments in certain \u201c\ncommodity linked notes \u201d and/or stock of a \u201c controlled foreign corporation \u201d that invests in physical\ncommodities and annually distributes its net income and gains generally should not produce such income. To\nremain within the 10% limitation, the Fund may need to hold such an investment or sell it at a loss, or sell\nother investments, when for investment reasons it would not otherwise do so. The availability of such\nmeasures does not guarantee that the Fund would be able to satisfy that limitation.\n\n4\n\nExposure to physical commodities may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional\nsecurities. The value of such investments may be affected by overall market movements, commodity index\nvolatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as\nsupply and demand, drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and\nregulatory developments, including but not limited to, changes in the laws, regulations, or tax regimes of\nthe United States or the Cayman Islands. Their value may also respond to investor perception of instability\nin the national or international economy, whether or not justified by the facts. However, these investments\nmay help to moderate fluctuations in the value of the Fund's other holdings, because these investments may\nnot correlate with investments in traditional securities. Economic and other events (whether real or\nperceived) can reduce the demand for commodities, which may reduce market prices and cause the value of the\nFund's shares to fall. No active trading market may exist for certain commodities investments, which may\nimpair the ability of the Fund to sell or realize the full value of such investments in the event of the\nneed to liquidate such investments. Certain commodities are subject to limited pricing flexibility because\nof supply and demand factors. Others are subject to broad price fluctuations as a result of the volatility\nof the prices for certain raw materials and the instability of the supplies of other materials. These\nadditional variables may create additional investment risks and result in greater volatility than\ninvestments in traditional securities. Because physical commodities do not generate investment income, the\nreturn on such investments will be derived solely from the appreciation or depreciation on such investments.\nCertain types of commodities instruments are subject to the risk that the counterparty to the instrument\nwill not perform or will be unable to perform in accordance with the terms of the instrument. The Subsidiary\nwill not generally be subject to U.S. laws (including securities laws) and their protections. Further, it\nwill be subject to the laws of a foreign jurisdiction, which can be adversely affected by developments in\nthat jurisdiction. CONCENTRATION The Fund will concentrate its investments in securities of issuers in the\nsame industry as may be necessary to approximate the composition of the Fund's underlying Index. The\nsecurities of issuers in particular industries may dominate the benchmark Index of the Fund and consequently\nthe Fund's investment portfolio. This may adversely affect the Fund's performance or subject its Shares to\ngreater price volatility than that experienced by less concentrated investment companies. The Trust's\ngeneral policy is to exclude securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities when\nmeasuring industry concentration. In pursuing its objective, the Fund may hold the securities of a single\nissuer in an amount exceeding 10% of the market value of the outstanding securities of the issuer, subject\nto restrictions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. In particular, as the Fund's size grows and its assets\nincrease, it will be more likely to hold more than 10% of the securities of a single issuer if the issuer\nhas a relatively small public float as compared to other components in its benchmark Index. EXCHANGE-TRADED\nFUNDS The Fund may invest in other exchange-traded funds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) (including ETFs managed by the\nAdviser). ETFs may be structured as investment companies that are registered under the 1940 Act, typically\nas open-end funds or unit investment trusts. These ETFs are generally based on specific domestic and foreign\nmarket securities indices. An \u201c index-based ETF \u201d seeks to provide investment results that match the\nperformance of an index by holding in its portfolio either the contents of the index or a representative\nsample of the securities in the index. An \u201c actively-managed ETF \u201d invests in securities based on an\nadviser's investment strategy. An \u201c enhanced ETF \u201d seeks to provide investment results that match a positive\nor negative multiple of the performance of an underlying index. In seeking to provide such results, an ETF\nand, in particular, an enhanced ETF, may engage in short sales of securities included in the underlying\nindex and may invest in derivatives instruments, such as equity index swaps, futures contracts, and options\non securities, futures contracts, and stock indices. Alternatively, ETFs may be structured as grantor trusts\nor other forms of pooled investment vehicles that are not registered or regulated under the 1940 Act. These\nETFs typically hold commodities, precious metals, currency or other non-securities investments. ETFs, like\nmutual funds, have expenses associated with their operation, such as advisory and custody fees. When the\nFund invests in an ETF, in addition to directly bearing expenses associated with its own operations,\nincluding the brokerage costs associated with the purchase and sale of shares of the ETF, the Fund will bear\na pro rata portion of the ETF's expenses. In addition, it may be more costly to own an ETF than to directly\nown the securities or other investments held by the ETF because of ETF expenses. The risks of owning shares\nof an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities or other investments held by the\nETF, although lack of liquidity in the market for the shares of an ETF could result in the ETF's value being\nmore volatile than the underlying securities or other investments.\n\n5\n\nFUTURES CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAP AGREEMENTS The Fund may invest in derivatives, including exchange-traded\nfutures on indices, exchange-traded futures on Treasuries or Eurodollars, U.S. exchange-traded or OTC put\nand call options contracts and exchange-traded or OTC swap transactions (including NDFs, interest rate\nswaps, total return swaps, excess return swaps, and credit default swaps). Futures and Options on Futures:\nFutures contracts generally provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a\nspecified commodity or security at a specified future time and at a specified price. Index futures contracts\nare settled daily with a payment by one party to the other of a cash amount based on the difference between\nthe level of the index specified in the contract from one day to the next. A futures contract on an index is\nan agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the\ndifference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price\nat which the index contract originally was written. Although the value of an index might be a function of\nthe value of certain specified securities, physical delivery of these securities is not always made. A\npublic market exists in futures contracts covering a number of indexes, as well as financial instruments,\nincluding, without limitation: U.S. Treasury bonds; U.S. Treasury notes; GNMA Certificates; three-month U.S.\nTreasury bills; 90-day commercial paper; bank certificates of deposit; Eurodollar certificates of deposit;\nthe Australian Dollar; the Canadian Dollar; the British Pound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss Franc; the\nMexican Peso; and certain multinational currencies, such as the Euro. It is expected that other futures\ncontracts will be developed and traded in the future. Futures contracts are standardized as to maturity date\nand underlying instrument and are traded on futures exchanges. The Fund may purchase and write (sell) call\nand put options on futures. Options on futures give the holder the right, in return for the premium paid, to\nassume a long position (call) or short position (put) in a futures contract at a specified exercise price\nupon expiration of, or at any time during the period of, the option. Upon exercise of a call option, the\nholder acquires a long position in the futures contract and the writer is assigned the opposite short\nposition. In the case of a put option, the opposite is true. The Fund may invest, either directly or\nindirectly through the Subsidiary, in commodity-linked futures contracts. Commodity-linked futures contracts\nare generally based upon commodities within six main commodity groups: (1) energy, which includes, among\nothers, crude oil, gas oil, natural gas, gasoline and heating oil; (2) livestock, which includes, among\nothers, feeder cattle, live cattle and hogs; (3) agriculture, which includes, among others, wheat (Kansas\nCity wheat and Chicago wheat), corn and soybeans; (4) industrial metals, which includes, among others,\naluminum, copper, lead, nickel and zinc; (5) precious metals, which includes, among others, gold, silver,\nplatinum and palladium; and (6) softs, which includes cotton, coffee, sugar and cocoa. With respect to these\nphysical commodities, the price of a commodity futures contract will reflect the storage costs of purchasing\nthe physical commodity. These storage costs include the time value of money invested in the physical\ncommodity plus the actual costs of storing the commodity, less any benefits from ownership of the physical\ncommodity that are not obtained by the holder of a futures contract (these benefits are sometimes referred\nto as the \u201c convenience yield \u201d ). To the extent that these storage costs change for an underlying commodity\nwhile the Fund holds long futures contracts on that commodity, the value of the futures contract may change\nproportionately. The Fund is required to make a good faith margin deposit in cash or U.S. government\nsecurities (or other eligible collateral) with a broker or custodian to initiate and maintain open positions\nin futures contracts. A margin deposit is intended to assure completion of the contract (delivery or\nacceptance of the underlying commodity or payment of the cash settlement amount) if it is not terminated\nprior to the specified delivery date. Brokers may establish deposit requirements which are higher than the\nexchange minimums. Futures contracts are customarily purchased and sold on margin deposits which may range\nupward from less than 5% of the value of the contract being traded. After a futures contract position is\nopened, the value of the contract is marked to market daily. If the futures contract price changes to the\nextent that the margin on deposit does not satisfy price changes, additional payments will be required.\nConversely, change in the contract value may reduce the required margin, resulting in a repayment of excess\nmargin to the contract holder. Variation margin payments are made to and from the futures broker for as long\nas the contract remains open. In such case, the Fund would expect to earn interest income on its margin\ndeposits. Although some futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity,\ngenerally these obligations are closed out prior to delivery by offsetting purchases or sales of matching\nfutures contracts (involving the same exchange, underlying commodity, security or index and delivery month).\nIf an offsetting purchase price is less than the original sale price, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or\nif it is more, the Fund realizes a capital loss. Conversely, if an offsetting sale price is more than the\noriginal purchase price, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if it is less, the Fund realizes a capital\nloss. The transaction costs also must be included in these calculations.\n\n6\n\nOptions: The Fund may purchase and sell put and call options. Such options may relate to particular\nsecurities and may or may not be listed on a national securities exchange and issued by the Options Clearing\nCorporation. Options trading is a highly specialized activity that entails greater than ordinary investment\nrisk. Options on particular securities may be more volatile than the underlying securities, and therefore,\non a percentage basis, an investment in options may be subject to greater fluctuation than an investment in\nthe underlying securities themselves. Short Sales \u201c Against the Box \u201d : The Fund may engage in short sales \u201c\nagainst the box. \u201d In a short sale against the box, the Fund agrees to sell at a future date a security that\nit either contemporaneously owns or has the right to acquire at no extra cost. If the price of the security\nhas declined at the time the Fund is required to deliver the security, the Fund will benefit from the\ndifference in the price. If the price of the security has increased, the Fund will be required to pay the\ndifference. Swap Transactions: The Fund may enter into swap transactions, including interest rate swap,\ncredit default swap, NDF, and total return swap transactions. Swap transactions are contracts between\nparties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to the other party based on the change in market\nvalue or level of a specified rate, index or asset. In return, the other party agrees to make payments to\nthe first party based on the return of a different specified rate, index or asset. Swap transactions will\nusually be done on a net basis, i.e., where the two parties make net payments with the Fund receiving or\npaying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any,\nof the Fund's obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis and an\namount of cash or equivalents having an aggregate value at least equal to the accrued excess is maintained\nby the Fund. Swaps may be used in conjunction with other instruments to offset interest rate, currency or\nother underlying risks. For example, interest rate swaps may be offset with \u201c caps, \u201d \u201c floors \u201d or \u201c\ncollars. \u201d A \u201c cap \u201d is essentially a call option which places a limit on the amount of floating rate\ninterest that must be paid on a certain principal amount. A \u201c floor \u201d is essentially a put option which\nplaces a limit on the minimum amount that would be paid on a certain principal amount. A \u201c collar \u201d is\nessentially a combination of a long cap and a short floor where the limits are set at different levels. The\nuse of swap transactions by the Fund entails certain risks, which may be different from, or possibly greater\nthan, the risks associated with investing directly in the securities and other investments that are the\nreferenced asset for the swap agreement. Swaps are highly specialized instruments that require investment\ntechniques, risk analyses, and tax planning different from those associated with stocks, bonds, and other\ntraditional investments. The use of a swap requires an understanding not only of the referenced asset,\nreference rate, or index, but also of the swap itself, without the benefit of observing the performance of\nthe swap under all the possible market conditions. Because some swap transactions have a leverage component,\nadverse changes in the value or level of the underlying asset, reference rate, or index can result in a loss\nsubstantially greater than the amount invested in the swap itself. Certain swaps have the potential for\nunlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial investment. Bilateral OTC transactions differ from\nexchange-traded or cleared derivatives transactions in several respects. Bilateral OTC transactions are\ntransacted directly with dealers and not with a clearing corporation. Without the availability of a clearing\ncorporation, bilateral OTC transaction pricing is normally done by reference to information from market\nmakers and/or available index data, which information is carefully monitored by the Adviser and verified in\nappropriate cases. As bilateral OTC transactions are entered into directly with a dealer, there is a risk of\nnonperformance by the dealer as a result of its insolvency or otherwise. Under regulations adopted by the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission ( \u201c CFTC \u201d ) and federal banking regulators ( \u201c Margin Rules \u201d ), the\nFund is required to post collateral (known as variation margin) to cover the mark-to-market exposure in\nrespect of its uncleared swaps. The Margin Rules also mandate that collateral in the form of initial margin\nbe posted to cover potential future exposure attributable to uncleared swap transactions. In the event the\nFund is required to post collateral in the form of initial margin or variation margin in respect of its\nuncleared swap transactions, all such collateral will be posted with a third party custodian pursuant to a\ntriparty custody agreement between the Fund, its dealer counterparty and an unaffiliated custodian. The\nrequirement to execute certain OTC derivatives contracts on exchanges or electronic trading platforms called\nswap execution facilities ( \u201c SEFs \u201d ) may offer certain advantages over traditional bilateral OTC trading,\nsuch as ease of execution, price transparency, increased liquidity and/or favorable pricing. However, SEF\ntrading may make it more difficult and costly for the Fund to enter into highly tailored or customized\ntransactions and may result in additional costs and risks. Market participants such as the Fund that execute\nderivatives contracts through a SEF, whether directly or through a broker intermediary, are required to\nsubmit to the jurisdiction of the SEF and comply with SEF and CFTC rules and regulations which impose, among\nother things disclosure and recordkeeping obligations. In addition, the Fund will generally incur SEF or\nbroker intermediary fees when it trades on a SEF. The Fund may also be required to indemnify the SEF or\nbroker intermediary for any losses or costs that may result from the Fund's transactions on the SEF.\n\n7\n\nTotal Return Swaps: The Fund may enter into total return swap transactions for investment purposes. Total\nreturn swaps are transactions in which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in\nmarket value of the underlying assets, which may include a specified security, basket of securities or\nsecurity indexes during the specified period, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable\ninterest rate of the total return from other underlying assets. Total return swaps may be used to obtain\nexposure to a security or market without owning or taking physical custody of such security or market,\nincluding in cases in which there may be disadvantages associated with direct ownership of a particular\nsecurity. In a typical total return equity swap, payments made by the Fund or the counterparty are based on\nthe total return of a particular reference asset or assets (such as an equity security, a combination of\nsuch securities, or an index). That is, one party agrees to pay another party the return on a stock, basket\nof stocks, or stock index in return for a specified interest rate. By entering into an equity index swap,\nfor example, the index receiver can gain exposure to stocks making up the index of securities without\nactually purchasing those stocks. Total return swaps involve not only the risk associated with the\ninvestment in the underlying securities, but also the risk of the counterparty not fulfilling its\nobligations under the agreement. Credit Default Swaps: The Fund may enter into credit default swap\ntransactions for investment purposes. A credit default swap transaction may have as reference obligations\none or more securities that are not currently held by the Fund. The Fund may be either the protection buyer\nor protection seller in the transaction. Credit default swaps may also be structured based on the debt of a\nbasket of issuers, rather than a single issuer, and may be customized with respect to the default event that\ntriggers purchase or other factors. As a protection seller, the Fund would generally receive an upfront\npayment or a fixed rate of income throughout the term of the swap, which typically is between six months and\nthree years, provided that there is no credit event. If a credit event occurs, generally the protection\nseller must pay the protection buyer the full face amount of the reference obligations that may have little\nor no value. If the Fund were a protection buyer and no credit event occurred during the term of the swap,\nthe Fund would recover nothing if the swap were held through its termination date. However, if a credit\nevent occurred, the protection buyer may elect to receive the full notional value of the swap in exchange\nfor an equal face amount of the reference obligation that may have little or no value. Where the Fund is the\nprotection buyer, credit default swaps involve the risk that the seller may fail to satisfy its payment\nobligations to the Fund in the event of a default. The purchase of credit default swaps involves costs,\nwhich will reduce the Fund's return. Currency Swaps: The Fund may enter into currency swap transactions for\ninvestment purposes. Currency swaps are similar to interest rate swaps, except that they involve multiple\ncurrencies. The Fund may enter into a currency swap when it has exposure to one currency and desires\nexposure to a different currency. Typically, the interest rates that determine the currency swap payments\nare fixed, although occasionally one or both parties may pay a floating rate of interest. Unlike an interest\nrate swap, however, the principal amounts are exchanged at the beginning of the contract and returned at the\nend of the contract. In addition to paying and receiving amounts at the beginning and end of the\ntransaction, both sides will have to pay in full on a periodic basis based upon the currency they have\nborrowed. Change in foreign exchange rates and changes in interest rates, as described above, may negatively\naffect currency swaps. Interest Rate Swaps: The Fund may enter into an interest rate swap in an effort to\nprotect against declines in the value of fixed income securities held by the Fund. In such an instance, the\nFund may agree to pay a fixed rate (multiplied by a notional amount) while a counterparty agrees to pay a\nfloating rate (multiplied by the same notional amount). If interest rates rise, resulting in a diminution in\nthe value of the Fund's portfolio, the Fund would receive payments under the swap that would offset, in\nwhole or in part, such diminution in value. Options on Swaps: An option on a swap agreement, or a \u201c\nswaption, \u201d is a contract that gives a counterparty the right (but not the obligation) to enter into a new\nswap agreement or to shorten, extend, cancel or otherwise modify an existing swap agreement, at some\ndesignated future time on specified terms. In return, the purchaser pays a \u201c premium \u201d to the seller of the\ncontract. The seller of the contract receives the premium and bears the risk of unfavorable changes on the\nunderlying swap. The Fund may write (sell) and purchase put and call swaptions. The Fund may also enter into\nswaptions on either an asset-based or liability-based basis, depending on whether the Fund is hedging its\nassets or its liabilities. The Fund may write (sell) and purchase put and call swaptions to the same extent\nit may make use of standard options on securities or other instruments. The Fund may enter into these\ntransactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its holdings,\nas a duration management technique, to protect against an increase in the price of securities the Fund\nanticipates purchasing at a later date, or for any other purposes, such as for speculation to increase\nreturns. Swaptions are generally subject to the same risks involved in the Fund's use of options.\n\n8\n\nDepending on the terms of the particular option agreement, the Fund will generally incur a greater degree of\nrisk when it writes a swaption than it will incur when it purchases a swaption. When the Fund purchases a\nswaption, it risks losing only the amount of the premium it has paid should it decide to let the option\nexpire unexercised. However, when the Fund writes a swaption, upon exercise of the option the Fund will\nbecome obligated according to the terms of the underlying agreement. Government Regulation: The Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201c Dodd-Frank Act \u201d ) that was signed into law on July\n21, 2010 created a new statutory framework that comprehensively regulated the over-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d )\nderivatives markets for the first time. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the OTC derivatives markets were\ntraditionally traded on a bilateral basis (so-called \u201c bilateral OTC transactions \u201d ). Under the Dodd-Frank\nAct, certain OTC derivatives transactions are now required to be centrally cleared and traded on SEFs. On\nOctober 28, 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 18f-4 (the \u201c Derivatives Rule \u201d ) under the 1940 Act which replaced\nprior SEC and staff guidance with an updated, comprehensive framework for registered funds' use of\nderivatives. The Derivatives Rule permits the Fund to enter into derivatives transactions and certain other\ntransactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior securities \u201d under Section 18 of\nthe 1940 Act. The Derivatives Rule requires the Fund to trade derivatives and certain other instruments that\ncreate future payment or delivery obligations subject to a value-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ) leverage limit, develop\nand implement a derivatives risk management program and new testing requirements, and comply with new\nrequirements related to board and SEC reporting. These requirements apply unless the Fund qualifies as a \u201c\nlimited derivatives user, \u201d as defined in the Derivatives Rule. Complying with the Derivatives Rule may\nincrease the cost of the Fund's investments and cost of doing business, which could adversely affect\ninvestors. Other new regulations could adversely affect the value, availability and performance of certain\nderivative instruments, may make them more costly, and may limit or restrict their use by the Fund.\nRegulation Under the Commodity Exchange Act: The Fund, directly or indirectly through investments in the\nSubsidiary, intends to use commodity interests, such as futures, swaps and options on futures. The Fund may\nuse exchange-traded futures and options on futures, together with positions in cash and money market\ninstruments, to simulate full investment in its underlying Index. Exchange-traded futures and options on\nfutures contracts may not be currently available for the Index. Under such circumstances, the Adviser may\nseek to utilize other instruments that it believes to be correlated to the Index components or a subset of\nthe components. Due to the Fund's potential use of derivatives above the prescribed levels, the Fund and the\nSubsidiary will each be considered a \u201c commodity pool \u201d under the CEA. The Adviser has registered with the\nCFTC as a commodity pool operator under the CEA with regard to the Fund and the Subsidiary and is subject to\nCFTC regulation with respect to the Fund. The CFTC adopted amended regulations of CPOs managing funds\nregistered under the 1940 Act to \u201c harmonize \u201d the SEC's and the CFTC's regulatory schemes. The adopted\namendments to the CFTC regulations allow CPOs to registered investment companies to satisfy certain\nrecordkeeping, reporting and disclosure requirements that would otherwise apply to them under Part 4 of the\nCFTC's regulations by continuing to comply with comparable SEC requirements. Restrictions on Trading in\nCommodity Interests: The Fund reserves the right to engage in transactions involving futures, options\nthereon and swaps to the extent allowed by the CFTC regulations in effect from time to time and in\naccordance with the Fund's policies. Certain additional risk factors related to derivatives are discussed\nbelow: Derivatives Risk: Under recently adopted rules by the CFTC, transactions in some types of interest\nrate swaps and index credit default swaps on North American and European indices are required to be cleared.\nIn addition, the CFTC may promulgate additional regulations that require clearing of other classes of swaps.\nIn a cleared derivatives transaction (which includes futures, options on futures, and cleared swaps\ntransactions), the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house (such as CME, ICE Clear Credit or LCH.Clearnet),\nrather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of a clearing house and only members of a\nclearing house can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund holds cleared derivatives through\naccounts at clearing members, who are futures commission merchants that are members of the clearing houses\nand who have the appropriate regulatory approvals to engage in cleared derivatives transactions. The Fund\nmakes and receives payments owed under cleared derivatives transactions (including margin payments) through\nits accounts at clearing members. Clearing members guarantee performance of their clients' obligations to\nthe clearing house. In contrast to bilateral OTC transactions, clearing members generally can require\ntermination of existing cleared derivatives transactions at any time and increases in margin above the\nmargin that it required at the beginning of a transaction. Clearing houses also have broad rights to\nincrease margin requirements for existing transactions and to terminate transactions in accordance with\ntheir rules. Any such increase or termination could interfere with the ability of the\n\n9\n\nFund to pursue its investment strategy. Also, the Fund is subject to execution risk if it enters into a\nderivatives transaction that is required to be cleared (or that the Advisor expects to be cleared), and no\nclearing member is willing or able to clear the transaction on the Fund's behalf. While the documentation in\nplace between the Fund and its clearing members generally provides that the clearing members will accept for\nclearing all transactions submitted for clearing that are within credit limits specified by the clearing\nmembers in advance, the Fund could be subject to this execution risk if the Fund submits for clearing\ntransactions that exceed such credit limits, if the clearing house does not accept the transactions for\nclearing, or if the clearing members do not comply with their agreement to clear such transactions. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be terminated, and the Fund could lose some or all of the benefit of any\nincrease in the value of the transaction after the time of the transaction. In addition, new regulations\ncould, among other things, restrict the Fund's ability to engage in, or increase the cost to the Fund of,\nderivatives transactions, for example, by making some types of derivatives no longer available to the Fund\nor increasing margin or capital requirements. If the Fund is not able to enter into a particular derivatives\ntransaction, the Fund's investment performance and risk profile could be adversely affected as a result.\nCounterparty Risk: Counterparty risk with respect to OTC derivatives may be affected by new regulations\npromulgated by the CFTC and SEC affecting the derivatives market. As described under \u201c Derivatives Risk \u201d\nabove, all futures and options on futures and some swap transactions are required to be cleared, and a party\nto a cleared derivatives transaction is subject to the credit risk of the clearing house and the clearing\nmember through which it holds its cleared derivatives position, rather than the credit risk of its original\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction. Clearing members are required to segregate all funds received\nfrom customers with respect to cleared derivatives transactions from the clearing member's proprietary\nassets. However, all funds and other property received by a clearing broker from its customers are generally\nheld by the clearing broker on a commingled basis in an omnibus account, and the clearing broker may also\ninvest those funds in certain instruments permitted under the applicable regulations. Also, the clearing\nmember transfers to the clearing house the amount of margin required by the clearing house for cleared\nderivatives transactions, which amounts are generally held in the relevant omnibus account at the clearing\nhouse for all customers of the clearing member. For commodities futures positions, the clearing house may\nuse all of the collateral held in the clearing member's omnibus account to meet a loss in that account,\nwithout regard to which customer in fact supplied that collateral. Accordingly, in addition to bearing the\ncredit risk of its clearing member, each customer to a futures transaction also bears \u201c fellow customer \u201d\nrisk from other customers of the clearing member. However, with respect to cleared swaps positions, recent\nregulations promulgated by the CFTC require that the clearing member notify the clearing house of the amount\nof initial margin provided by the clearing member to the clearing house that is attributable to each\ncustomer. Because margin in respect of cleared swaps must be earmarked for specific clearing member\ncustomers, the clearing house may not use the collateral of one customer to cover the obligations of another\ncustomer. However, if the clearing member does not provide accurate reporting, the Fund is subject to the\nrisk that a clearing house will use the Fund's assets held in an omnibus account at the clearing house to\nsatisfy payment obligations of a defaulting customer of the clearing member to the clearing house. In\naddition, clearing members may generally choose to provide to the clearing house the net amount of variation\nmargin required for cleared swaps for all of its customers in the aggregate, rather than the gross amount\nfor each customer. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The Fund may take advantage of opportunities in the area of options\nand futures contracts, options on futures contracts, warrants, swaps and any other investments which are not\npresently contemplated for use by the Fund or which are not currently available but which may be developed,\nto the extent such opportunities are both consistent with the Fund's investment objective and legally\npermissible for the Fund. Before entering into such transactions or making any such investment, the Fund\nwill provide appropriate disclosure. ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS The Fund may invest in illiquid investments. The\nFund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have\ninvested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment means any\ninvestment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in\nseven calendar days or less without the sale or disposition significantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of the Fund's net assets, certain remedial actions will be\ntaken as required by Rule 22e-4 under the 1940 Act and the Fund's policies and procedures.\n\n10\n\nINFLATION-PROTECTED OBLIGATIONS The Fund may invest in inflation-protected public obligations, commonly\nknown as \u201c TIPS, \u201d of the U.S. Treasury, as well as TIPS of major governments and emerging market countries,\nexcluding the United States. TIPS are a type of security issued by a government that are designed to provide\ninflation protection to investors. TIPS are income-generating instruments whose interest and principal\npayments are adjusted for inflation\u2014a sustained increase in prices that erodes the purchasing power of\nmoney. The inflation adjustment, which is typically applied monthly to the principal of the bond, follows a\ndesignated inflation index, such as the Consumer Price Index. A fixed coupon rate is applied to the\ninflation-adjusted principal so that as inflation rises or falls, both the principal value and the interest\npayments will increase or decrease. This can provide investors with a hedge against inflation, as it helps\npreserve the purchasing power of an investment. Because of this inflation adjustment feature, inflation-\nprotected bonds typically have lower yields than conventional fixed-rate bonds. INVESTMENT COMPANIES The\nFund may invest in the securities of other investment companies, including affiliated funds and money market\nfunds, subject to applicable limitations under Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Section\n12(d)(1), the Fund may invest in the securities of another investment company (the \u201c acquired company \u201d )\nprovided that the Fund, immediately after such purchase or acquisition, does not own in the aggregate: (i)\nmore than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company; (ii) securities issued by the\nacquired company having an aggregate value in excess of 5% of the value of the total assets of the Fund; or\n(iii) securities issued by the acquired company and all other investment companies (other than Treasury\nstock of the Fund) having an aggregate value in excess of 10% of the value of the total assets of the Fund.\nTo the extent allowed by law, regulation, and/or the Fund's investment restrictions, the Fund may invest its\nassets in securities of investment companies, including affiliated funds and/or money market funds, in\nexcess of the limits discussed above. If the Fund invests in and, thus, is a shareholder of, another\ninvestment company, the Fund's shareholders will indirectly bear the Fund's proportionate share of the fees\nand expenses paid by such other investment company, including advisory fees, in addition to both the\nmanagement fees payable directly by the Fund to the Fund's own investment adviser and the other expenses\nthat the Fund bears directly in connection with the Fund's own operations. LENDING PORTFOLIO SECURITIES The\nFund may lend portfolio securities to certain creditworthy borrowers in U.S. and non-U.S. markets in an\namount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets. The borrowers provide collateral that is marked to\nmarket daily in an amount at least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. The Fund may\nterminate a loan at any time and obtain the securities loaned. The Fund receives the value of any interest\nor cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned securities. The Fund cannot vote proxies for securities\non loan, but may recall loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the Fund's economic interest in\nthe investment is to be voted upon. Efforts to recall such securities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly traded securities. Distributions received on loaned securities\nin lieu of dividend payments (i.e., substitute payments) would not be considered qualified dividend income.\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based\non the amount of cash collateral. The Fund is compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the\nreinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash,\nthe Fund is compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the\nloaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain high quality short-term instruments\neither directly on behalf of the lending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or funds, which may\ninclude those managed by the Adviser. The Fund could lose money due to a decline in the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or any investments made with cash collateral. Certain non-cash collateral or\ninvestments made with cash collateral may have a greater risk of loss than other non-cash collateral or\ninvestments. The Fund may pay a portion of the interest or fees earned from securities lending to a borrower\nas described above, and to one or more securities lending agents approved by the Board of Trustees of the\nTrust (the \u201c Board \u201d ) who administer the lending program for the Fund in accordance with guidelines\napproved by the Board. In such capacity, the lending agent provides the following services to the Fund in\nconnection with the Fund's securities lending activities: (i) locating borrowers among an approved list of\nprospective borrowers; (ii) causing the delivery of loaned securities from the Fund to borrowers; (iii)\nmonitoring the value of loaned securities, the value of collateral received, and other lending parameters;\n(iv) seeking additional collateral, as necessary, from borrowers; (v) receiving and holding collateral from\nborrowers, and facilitating the\n\n11\n\ninvestment and reinvestment of all or substantially all cash collateral in an investment vehicle designated\nby the Fund; (vi) returning collateral to borrowers; (vii) facilitating substitute dividend, interest, and\nother distribution payments to the Fund from borrowers; (viii) negotiating the terms of each loan of\nsecurities, including but not limited to the amount of any loan premium, and monitoring the terms of\nsecurities loan agreements with prospective borrowers for consistency with the requirements of the Fund's\nSecurities Lending Authorization Agreement; (ix) selecting securities, including amounts (percentages), to\nbe loaned; (x) recordkeeping and accounting servicing; and (xi) arranging for return of loaned securities to\nthe Fund in accordance with the terms of the Securities Lending Authorization Agreement. State Street Bank\nand Trust Company ( \u201c State Street \u201d ), an affiliate of the Trust, has been approved by the Board to serve\nas securities lending agent for the Fund and the Trust has entered into an agreement with State Street for\nsuch services. Among other matters, the Trust has agreed to indemnify State Street for certain liabilities.\nState Street has received an order of exemption from the SEC under Sections 17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the\n1940 Act to serve as the lending agent for affiliated investment companies such as the Trust and to invest\nthe cash collateral received from loan transactions to be invested in an affiliated cash collateral fund.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses\nresulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process especially so in certain international\nmarkets such as Taiwan), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), risk of loss of collateral, credit,\nlegal, counterparty and market risk. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, the Fund would be\nsubject to the risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or\nto a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return the Fund's\nsecurities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the\ncollateral do not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated,\nplus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement securities. Although State Street has agreed\nto provide the Fund with indemnification in the event of a borrower default, the Fund is still exposed to\nthe risk of losses in the event a borrower does not return the Fund's securities as agreed. For example,\ndelays in recovery of lent securities may cause the Fund to lose the opportunity to sell the securities at a\ndesirable price. LEVERAGING While the Fund does not anticipate doing so, the Fund may borrow money in an\namount greater than 5% of the value of the Fund's total assets. However, under normal circumstances, the\nFund will not borrow money from a bank in an amount greater than 10% of the value of the Fund's total\nassets. Borrowing for investment purposes is one form of leverage. Leveraging investments, by purchasing\nsecurities with borrowed money, is a speculative technique that increases investment risk, but also\nincreases investment opportunity. Because substantially all of the Fund's assets will fluctuate in value,\nwhereas the interest obligations on borrowings may be fixed, the NAV of the Fund will increase more when\nsuch Fund's portfolio assets increase in value and decrease more when the Fund's portfolio assets decrease\nin value than would otherwise be the case. Moreover, interest costs on borrowings may fluctuate with\nchanging market rates of interest and may partially offset or exceed the returns on the borrowed funds.\nOTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS The Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money market\ninstruments, (including money market funds advised by the Adviser), cash and cash equivalents, on an ongoing\nbasis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those\nadvised by the Adviser); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or\ninstrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c\nCDs \u201d ), bankers' acceptances, fixed time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and foreign banks\n(including foreign branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated at the date of purchase \u201c\nPrime-1 \u201d by Moody's Investors Service ( \u201c Moody's \u201d ) or \u201c A-1 \u201d by S&P Global Ratings ( \u201c S&P \u201d ), or if\nunrated, of comparable quality as determined by the Adviser; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities\n(e.g., bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and\nthat present minimal credit risk; and (vi) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of foreign banks\n(including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of the Adviser, are of comparable quality to obligations of\nU.S. banks which may be purchased by the Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or a\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking institutions for\nspecified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers' acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial\nbanks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions. Money market instruments also\ninclude shares of money market funds. The SEC and other government agencies continue to review the\nregulation of money market funds. The SEC has adopted\n\n12\n\nchanges to the rules that govern money market funds over the years, most recently in July 2023. Legislative\ndevelopments may also affect money market funds. These changes and developments may affect the investment\nstrategies, performance, yield, operating expenses and continued viability of a money market fund. RATINGS\nAn investment grade rating means the security or issuer is rated investment grade by Moody's, S&P, Fitch\nRatings, Inc. ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ), Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited, or another credit rating agency\ndesignated as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization by the SEC, or is unrated but\nconsidered to be of equivalent quality by the Adviser. Subsequent to purchase by the Fund, a rated security\nmay cease to be rated or its investment grade rating may be reduced below an investment grade rating. Bonds\nrated lower than Baa3 by Moody's or BBB- by S&P or Fitch are below investment grade quality and are\nobligations of issuers that are considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity\nto pay interest and repay principal according to the terms of the obligation and, therefore, carry greater\ninvestment risk, including the possibility of issuer default and bankruptcy and increased market price\nvolatility. Such securities ( \u201c lower rated securities \u201d ) are commonly referred to as \u201c junk \u201d bonds and\nare subject to a substantial degree of credit risk. Lower rated securities are often issued by smaller, less\ncreditworthy companies or by highly leveraged (indebted) firms, which are generally less able than more\nfinancially stable firms to make scheduled payments of interest and principal. The risks posed by securities\nissued under such circumstances are substantial. Bonds rated below investment-grade tend to be less\nmarketable than higher-quality bonds because the market for them is less broad. The market for unrated bonds\nis even narrower. See Appendix A for more information on the ratings of debt instruments. REPURCHASE\nAGREEMENTS The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements with commercial banks, brokers or dealers to\ngenerate income from its excess cash balances and to invest securities lending cash collateral. A repurchase\nagreement is an agreement under which the Fund acquires a financial instrument (e.g., a security issued by\nthe U.S. government or an agency thereof, a banker's acceptance or a certificate of deposit) from a seller,\nsubject to resale to the seller at an agreed upon price and date (normally, the next Business Day\u2014as defined\nbelow). A repurchase agreement may be considered a loan collateralized by securities. The resale price\nreflects an agreed upon interest rate effective for the period the instrument is held by the Fund and is\nunrelated to the interest rate on the underlying instrument. In these repurchase agreement transactions, the\nsecurities acquired by the Fund (including accrued interest earned thereon) must have a total value in\nexcess of the value of the repurchase agreement and are held by the Custodian until repurchased. No more\nthan an aggregate of 15% of the Fund's net assets will be invested in illiquid investments, including\nrepurchase agreements having maturities longer than seven days and securities subject to legal or\ncontractual restrictions on resale, or for which there are no readily available market quotations. The use\nof repurchase agreements involves certain risks. For example, if the other party to the agreement defaults\non its obligation to repurchase the underlying security at a time when the value of the security has\ndeclined, the Fund may incur a loss upon disposition of the security. If the other party to the agreement\nbecomes insolvent and subject to liquidation or reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other laws,\na court may determine that the underlying security is collateral for a loan by the Fund not within the\ncontrol of the Fund and, therefore, the Fund may not be able to substantiate its interest in the underlying\nsecurity and may be deemed an unsecured creditor of the other party to the agreement. U.S. GOVERNMENT\nOBLIGATIONS U.S. Government obligations are a type of bond. U.S. Government obligations include securities\nissued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities.\nOne type of U.S. Government obligation, U.S. Treasury obligations, are backed by the full faith and credit\nof the U.S. Treasury and differ only in their interest rates, maturities, and times of issuance. U.S.\nTreasury bills have initial maturities of one-year or less; U.S. Treasury notes have initial maturities of\none to ten years; and U.S. Treasury bonds generally have initial maturities of greater than ten years. Other\nU.S. Government obligations are issued or guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S. Government\nincluding, but not limited to, Federal National Mortgage Association ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d ), the Government\nNational Mortgage Association ( \u201c Ginnie Mae \u201d ), the Small Business Administration, the Federal Farm Credit\nAdministration, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( \u201c Freddie Mac \u201d ), the Federal Home Loan Banks\n( \u201c FHLB \u201d ), Banks for Cooperatives (including the Central Bank for Cooperatives), the Federal Land Banks,\nthe Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, the Tennessee Valley\n\n13\n\nAuthority, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Commodity Credit Corporation, the Federal\nFinancing Bank, the Student Loan Marketing Association, the National Credit Union Administration and the\nFederal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac). Some obligations issued or guaranteed by U.S.\nGovernment agencies and instrumentalities, including, for example, Ginnie Mae pass-through certificates, are\nsupported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury. Other obligations issued by or guaranteed by\nfederal agencies, such as those securities issued by Fannie Mae, are supported by the discretionary\nauthority of the U.S. Government to purchase certain obligations of the federal agency, while other\nobligations issued by or guaranteed by federal agencies, such as those of the Federal Home Loan Banks, are\nsupported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury. While the U.S. Government provides\nfinancial support to such U.S. Government-sponsored federal agencies, no assurance can be given that the\nU.S. Government will always do so, since the U.S. Government is not so obligated by law. In September 2008,\nthe U.S. Treasury announced a federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, placing the two federal\ninstrumentalities in conservatorship. Under the terms of the takeover, the U.S. Treasury agreed to acquire\n$1 billion of senior preferred stock of each instrumentality and obtained warrants for the purchase of\ncommon stock of each instrumentality. Under these Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements ( \u201c SPAs \u201d ),\nthe U.S. Treasury has pledged to provide a limited amount of capital per instrumentality as needed,\nincluding the contribution of cash capital to the instrumentalities in the event their liabilities exceed\ntheir assets. In May 2009, the U.S. Treasury increased its maximum commitment to each instrumentality under\nthe SPAs from $100 billion to $200 billion per instrumentality. In December 2009, the U.S. Treasury amended\nthe SPAs to provide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with some additional flexibility to meet the requirement to\nreduce their mortgage portfolios. Also in December 2009, the U.S. Treasury further amended the SPAs to allow\nthe cap on the U.S. Treasury's funding commitment to increase as necessary to accommodate any cumulative\nreduction in Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's net worth through the end of 2012. On August 17, 2012, the U.S.\nTreasury announced that it was again amending the SPAs to terminate the requirement that Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac each pay a 10% dividend annually on all amounts received under the funding commitment. Instead,\nthey were required to transfer to the U.S. Treasury on a quarterly basis all profits earned during a quarter\nthat exceeded a capital reserve amount of $3 billion. On September 30, 2019, the U.S. Treasury announced\namendments to the SPAs permitting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to maintain capital reserves of $25 billion and\n$20 billion, respectively. It is believed that the amendment puts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a better\nposition to service their debt because the companies no longer have to borrow from the U.S. Treasury to make\nfixed dividend payments. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the subject of several continuing class action\nlawsuits and investigations by federal regulators over certain accounting, disclosure or corporate\ngovernance matters, which (along with any resulting financial restatements) may adversely affect the\nguaranteeing entities. Importantly, the future of the entities is in serious question as the U.S. government\nreportedly is considering multiple options, ranging from nationalization, privatization, consolidation, or\nabolishment of the entities. VARIABLE AND FLOATING RATE SECURITIES Variable rate securities are instruments\nissued or guaranteed by entities such as (1) U.S. Government, or an agency or instrumentality thereof, (2)\nstates, municipalities and other political subdivisions, agencies, authorities and instrumentalities or\nstates and multi-state agencies or authorities, (3) corporations, (4) financial institutions, (5) insurance\ncompanies or (6) trusts that have a rate of interest subject to adjustment at regular intervals but less\nfrequently than annually. A variable rate security provides for the automatic establishment of a new\ninterest rate on set dates. Variable rate obligations whose interest is readjusted no less frequently than\nannually will be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the next readjustment of the\ninterest rate. The Fund may also purchase floating rate securities. A floating rate security provides for\nthe automatic adjustment of its interest rate whenever a specified interest rate changes. Interest rates on\nthese securities are ordinarily tied to, and are a percentage of, a widely recognized interest rate, such as\nthe yield on 90-day U.S. Treasury bills or the prime rate of a specified bank. These rates may change as\noften as twice daily. Generally, changes in interest rates will have a smaller effect on the market value of\nvariable and fixed rate floating rate securities than on the market value of comparable fixed rate fixed\nincome obligations. Thus, investing in variable and fixed rate floating rate securities generally allows\nless opportunity for capital appreciation and depreciation than investing in comparable fixed rate fixed\nincome securities. Special Considerations and Risks A discussion of the risks associated with an investment\nin the Fund is contained in the Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in\nconjunction with, the Prospectus.\n\n14\n\nGENERAL Investment in the Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund's portfolio\nsecurities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of securities generally and other factors. An investment in the Fund should\nalso be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in securities, including the risk\nthat the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the general condition of the securities\nmarkets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio securities and\nthus in the value of Shares). Securities are susceptible to general market fluctuations and to volatile\nincreases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors including expectations regarding\ngovernment, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or\ncontraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises. Securities of issuers traded on\nexchanges may be suspended on certain exchanges by the issuers themselves, by an exchange or by government\nauthorities. The likelihood of such suspensions may be higher for securities of issuers in emerging or less-\ndeveloped market countries than in countries with more developed markets. Trading suspensions may be applied\nfrom time to time to the securities of individual issuers for reasons specific to that issuer, or may be\napplied broadly by exchanges or governmental authorities in response to market events. Suspensions may last\nfor significant periods of time, during which trading in the securities and instruments that reference the\nsecurities, such as participatory notes (or \u201c P-notes \u201d ) or other derivative instruments, may be halted.\nThe principal trading market for some of the securities in an Index may be in the over-the-counter market.\nThe existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend on whether dealers will make a\nmarket in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or maintained or that any\nsuch market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of the Fund's\nShares will be adversely affected if trading markets for the Fund's portfolio securities are limited or\nabsent or if bid/ask spreads are wide. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK An investment in the Fund may be subject\nto a number of actual or potential conflicts of interest. For example, the Adviser or its affiliates may\nprovide services to the Fund, such as securities lending agency services, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer agency and shareholder servicing, securities brokerage\nservices, and other services for which the Fund would compensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates. The\nFund may invest in other pooled investment vehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates at which the Fund pays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its\naffiliates, or the terms on which it enters into transactions with the Adviser or its affiliates, will be\nthe most favorable available in the market generally or as favorable as the rates the Adviser makes\navailable to other clients. Because of its financial interest, the Adviser may have an incentive to enter\ninto transactions or arrangements on behalf of the Fund with itself or its affiliates in circumstances where\nit might not have done so in the absence of that interest. CONTINUOUS OFFERING The method by which Creation\nUnits of Shares are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because\nnew Creation Units of Shares are issued and sold by the Trust on an ongoing basis, at any point a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is used in the Securities Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are\ncautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being\ndeemed participants in a distribution in a manner which could render them statutory underwriters and subject\nthem to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act. For example, a broker-dealer\nfirm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order\nwith the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent Shares, and sells such Shares directly to customers,\nor if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new Shares with an active selling effort involving\nsolicitation of secondary market demand for Shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for\npurposes of the Securities Act must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the\nactivities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and the examples mentioned above\nshould not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as\nan underwriter.\n\n15\n\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are effecting\ntransactions in Shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of Shares, are generally required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\nSecurities Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940\nAct. Firms that incur a prospectus-delivery obligation with respect to Shares of the Fund are reminded that\nunder Securities Act Rule 153, a prospectus-delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the Securities Act\nowed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Exchange is satisfied by the fact that the\nFund's Prospectus is available at the Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in\nRule 153 is only available with respect to transactions on an exchange. SSGA or its affiliates (the \u201c\nSelling Shareholder \u201d ) may purchase Creation Units through a broker-dealer to \u201c seed \u201d (in whole or in\npart) the Fund as it is launched, or may purchase shares from broker-dealers or other investors that have\npreviously provided \u201c seed \u201d for the Fund when it was launched or otherwise in secondary market\ntransactions, and because the Selling Shareholder may be deemed an affiliate of the Fund, the Shares are\nbeing registered to permit the resale of these shares from time to time after purchase. The Fund will not\nreceive any of the proceeds from the resale by the Selling Shareholders of these Shares. The Selling\nShareholder intends to sell all or a portion of the Shares owned by it and offered hereby from time to time\ndirectly or through one or more broker-dealers, and may also hedge such positions. The Shares may be sold on\nany national securities exchange on which the Shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, in the\nover-the-counter market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at\nprevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at\nnegotiated prices. These sales may be effected in transactions, which may involve cross or block\ntransactions. The Selling Shareholder may also loan or pledge Shares to broker-dealers that in turn may sell\nsuch Shares, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The Selling Shareholder may also enter into options\nor other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more\nderivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of\nShares, which Shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell. The Selling Shareholder\nand any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of Shares may be deemed to be \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act in connection with such sales.\nIn such event, any commissions paid to any such broker-dealer or agent and any profit on the resale of the\nShares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.\nThe Selling Shareholder who may be deemed an \u201c underwriter \u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the\nSecurities Act will be subject to the applicable prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act.\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK Counterparty risk with respect to derivatives has been and may continue to be affected by\nnew rules and regulations affecting the derivatives market. Some derivatives transactions are required to be\ncentrally cleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives transaction is subject to the credit risk of the\nclearing house and the clearing member through which it holds its cleared position, rather than the credit\nrisk of its original counterparty to the derivatives transaction. Credit risk of market participants with\nrespect to derivatives that are centrally cleared is concentrated in a few clearing houses, and it is not\nclear how an insolvency proceeding of a clearing house would be conducted, what effect the insolvency\nproceeding would have on any recovery by the Fund, and what impact an insolvency of a clearing house would\nhave on the financial system more generally. FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS There can be no assurance that\na liquid secondary market will exist for any particular futures contract or option at any specific time.\nThus, it may not be possible to close a futures or options position. In the event of adverse price\nmovements, the Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required\nmargin. In such situations, if the Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, the Fund may\nbe required to make delivery of the instruments underlying futures contracts it has sold. The Fund will\nminimize the risk that it will be unable to close out a futures or options contract by only entering into\nfutures and options for which there appears to be a liquid secondary market.\n\n16\n\nThe risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (e.g., selling\nuncovered index futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan to use futures and\noptions contracts, when available, in this manner. The risk of a futures position may still be large as\ntraditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a relatively small price\nmovement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative\nto the size of a required margin deposit. The Fund, however, may utilize futures and options contracts in a\nmanner designed to limit its risk exposure to that which is comparable to what it would have incurred\nthrough direct investment in securities. Utilization of futures transactions by the Fund involves the risk\nof imperfect or even negative correlation to its benchmark Index if the index underlying the futures\ncontracts differs from the benchmark Index or if the futures contracts do not track the benchmark Index as\nexpected. There is also the risk of loss by the Fund of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a\nbroker with whom the Fund has an open position in the futures contract or option. Certain financial futures\nexchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day.\nThe \u201c daily price fluctuation limit \u201d or \u201c daily limit \u201d establishes the maximum amount that the price of a\nfutures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day's settlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of contract, generally no trades may be\nmade on that day at a price beyond that limit. The daily limit governs only price movement during a\nparticular trading day and therefore does not limit potential losses, because the limit may prevent the\nliquidation of unfavorable positions. Futures contract prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures\npositions and subjecting some futures traders to substantial losses. RISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS Swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on its obligations. If such a\ndefault occurs, the Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the\ntransaction, but such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws which could affect the\nFund's rights as a creditor. The use of interest-rate and index swaps is a highly specialized activity that\ninvolves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security\ntransactions. The use of a swap requires an understanding not only of the referenced asset, reference rate,\nor index, but also of the swap itself, without the benefit of observing the performance of the swap under\nall possible market conditions. These transactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or\nother underlying assets or principal. The absence of a regulated execution facility or contract market and\nlack of liquidity for swap transactions has led, in some instances, to difficulties in trading and\nvaluation, especially in the event of market disruptions. Under recently adopted rules and regulations,\ntransactions in some types of swaps are required to be centrally cleared. In a cleared derivatives\ntransaction, the Fund's counterparty to the transaction is a central derivatives clearing organization, or\nclearing house, rather than a bank or broker. Because the Fund is not a member of a clearing house, and only\nmembers of a clearing house can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund holds cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing members. In cleared derivatives transactions, the Fund will make\npayments (including margin payments) to and receive payments from a clearing house through its accounts at\nclearing members. Clearing members guarantee performance of their clients' obligations to the clearing\nhouse. Centrally cleared derivative arrangements may be less favorable to the Fund than bilateral (non-\ncleared) arrangements. For example, the Fund may be required to provide greater amounts of margin for\ncleared derivatives transactions than for bilateral derivatives transactions. Also, in contrast to bilateral\nderivatives transactions, in some cases following a period of notice to the Fund, a clearing member\ngenerally can require termination of existing cleared derivatives transactions at any time or an increase in\nmargin requirements above the margin that the clearing member required at the beginning of a transaction.\nClearing houses also have broad rights to increase margin requirements for existing transactions or to\nterminate transactions at any time in accordance with their rules. The Fund is subject to risk if it enters\ninto a derivatives transaction that is required to be cleared (or which SSGA FM expects to be cleared), and\nno clearing member is willing or able to clear the transaction on the Fund's behalf. In that case, the\ntransaction might have to be terminated, and the Fund could lose some or all of the benefit of the\ntransaction, including loss of an increase in the value of the transaction and loss of hedging protection.\nIn addition, the documentation governing the relationship between the Fund and clearing members is drafted\nby the clearing members and generally is less favorable to the Fund than typical bilateral derivatives\ndocumentation.\n\n17\n\nThese clearing rules and other new rules and regulations could, among other things, restrict the Fund's\nability to engage in, or increase the cost to the Fund of, derivatives transactions, for example, by making\nsome types of derivatives no longer available to the Fund, increasing margin or capital requirements, or\notherwise limiting liquidity or increasing transaction costs. These regulations, as applicable to swaps, are\nrelatively new and evolving, so their potential impact on the Fund and the financial system are not yet\nknown. Because they are two party contracts that may be subject to contractual restrictions on\ntransferability and termination and because they may have terms of greater than seven days, swap agreements\nmay be considered to be illiquid and subject to the Fund's limitation on investments in illiquid\ninvestments. To the extent that a swap is not liquid, it may not be possible to initiate a transaction or\nliquidate a position at an advantageous time or price, which may result in significant losses. Like most\nother investments, swap agreements are subject to the risk that the market value of the instrument will\nchange in a way detrimental to the Fund's interest. If the Fund uses a swap as a hedge against, or as a\nsubstitute for, a portfolio investment, the Fund will be exposed to the risk that the swap will have or will\ndevelop imperfect or no correlation with the portfolio investment. This could cause substantial losses for\nthe Fund. While hedging strategies involving swap instruments can reduce the risk of loss, they can also\nreduce the opportunity for gain or even result in losses by offsetting favorable price movements in other\nFund investments. Many swaps are complex and often valued subjectively. EUROPE \u2013 RECENT EVENTS A number of\ncountries in Europe, including Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal, have substantial government debt\nlevels. The concern over these debt levels has led to volatility in the European financial markets, which\nhas adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect every country\nin Europe. For some countries, the ability to repay sovereign debt is in question, and default is possible,\nwhich could affect their ability to borrow in the future. Several countries have agreed to multi-year\nbailout loans from the European Central Bank, the IMF, and other institutions. A default or debt\nrestructuring by any European country can adversely impact holders of that country's debt and can affect\nexposures to other European Union ( \u201c EU \u201d ) countries and their financial companies as well. These\nfinancial difficulties may continue, worsen or spread within or outside Europe. Responses to the financial\nproblems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may\nnot work, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other\nunintended consequences. Uncertainties regarding the viability of the EU have impacted and may continue to\nimpact markets in the United States and around the world. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally\nwithdrew from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and entered an 11-month transition period. The\ntransition period concluded on December 31, 2020, and the United Kingdom left the EU single market and\ncustoms union under the terms of a new trade agreement. The agreement governs the new relationship between\nthe United Kingdom and EU with respect to trading goods and services, but critical aspects of the\nrelationship remain unresolved and subject to further negotiation and agreement. Certain aspects of Brexit\nhave had an adverse impact on the region, leading to increased inflation, labor shortages and business\nclosures, among others. The full scope and nature of the consequences of the exit are not at this time known\nand are unlikely to be known for a significant period of time. It is also unknown whether the United\nKingdom's exit will increase the likelihood of other countries also departing the EU. Any additional exits\nfrom the EU, or the possibility of such exits, may have a significant impact on the United Kingdom, Europe,\nand global economies, which may result in increased volatility and illiquidity, new legal and regulatory\nuncertainties and potentially lower economic growth for such economies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments. MARKET TURBULENCE RESULTING FROM INFECTIOUS ILLNESS A\nwidespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as COVID-19, may lead to governments and businesses\nworld-wide taking aggressive measures, including closing borders, restricting international and domestic\ntravel, and the imposition of prolonged quarantines of large populations. As occurred in the wake of\nCOVID-19, the spread of such an illness may result in the disruption of and delays in the delivery of\nhealthcare services and processes, the cancellation of organized events and educational institutions, the\ndisruption of production and supply chains, a decline in consumer demand for certain goods and services, and\ngeneral concern and uncertainty, all of which may contribute to increased volatility in global markets.\nCOVID-19, and other epidemics and pandemics that may arise in the future, could adversely affect the\neconomies of many nations, the global economy, individual companies, sectors and industries, and capital\nmarkets in ways that cannot be foreseen at the present time. In addition, the impact of infectious diseases\nin developing or emerging\n\n18\n\nmarket countries may be greater due to limited health care resources. Political, economic and social\nstresses caused by infectious illness also may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic\nrisks in certain countries. The duration of such an illness and its effects cannot be determined at this\ntime, but the effects could be present for an extended period of time. RUSSIA SANCTIONS RISK Sanctions\nthreatened or imposed by a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union and the\nUnited Kingdom, and other intergovernmental actions that have been or may be undertaken in the future,\nagainst Russia, Russian entities or Russian individuals, may result in the devaluation of Russian currency,\na downgrade in the country's credit rating, an immediate freeze of Russian assets, a decline in the value\nand liquidity of Russian securities, property or interests, and/or other adverse consequences to the Russian\neconomy or the Fund. The scope and scale of sanctions in place at a particular time may be expanded or\notherwise modified in a way that have negative effects on the Fund. Sanctions, or the threat of new or\nmodified sanctions, could impair the ability of the Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive, deliver or otherwise\ntransact in certain affected securities or other investment instruments. Sanctions could also result in\nRussia taking counter measures or other actions in response, which may further impair the value and\nliquidity of Russian securities. These sanctions, and the resulting disruption of the Russian economy, may\ncause volatility in other regional and global markets and may negatively impact the performance of various\nsectors and industries, as well as companies in other countries, which could have a negative effect on the\nperformance of the Fund, even if the Fund does not have direct exposure to securities of Russian issuers. As\na collective result of the imposition of sanctions, Russian government countermeasures and the impact that\nthey have had on the trading markets for Russian securities, the Fund may use fair valuation procedures\napproved by the Fund's Board to value certain Russian securities, which could result in such securities\nbeing deemed to have a zero value. A reduction in liquidity of certain Fund holdings as a result of\nsanctions and related actions may cause the Fund to experience increased premiums or discounts to its NAV\nand/or wider bid-ask spreads. Additionally, if it becomes impracticable or unlawful for the Fund to hold\nsecurities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions, or if deemed appropriate by the Fund's\ninvestment adviser, the Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the affected securities in connection with\ncreation transactions and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase the Fund's transaction\ncosts. TAX RISKS As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in Shares of the Fund will\nbe taxed. The tax information in the Prospectus and this SAI is provided as general information. You should\nconsult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in Shares of the Fund. Unless\nyour investment in Shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-advantaged retirement account, such as\nan individual retirement account, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when the Fund makes\ndistributions or you sell Shares. Investment Restrictions The Trust has adopted the following investment\nrestrictions as fundamental policies with respect to the Fund. These restrictions cannot be changed without\nthe approval of the holders of a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities. For purposes of the\n1940 Act, a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund means the vote, at an annual or a\nspecial meeting of the security holders of the Trust, of the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the voting\nsecurities of the Fund present at such meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund. Except with the approval of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, the\nFund may not: 1. Concentrate its investments in securities of issuers in the same industry, except as may be\nnecessary to approximate the composition of the Fund's underlying Index; (1) 2. Make loans to another person\nexcept as permitted by the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or\nother regulatory agency with authority over the Fund;\n\n(1) The SEC Staff considers concentration to involve more than 25% of a fund's assets to be invested in an\nindustry or group of industries.\n\n19\n\n3. Issue senior securities or borrow money except as permitted by the 1940 Act or other governing statute,\nby the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund; 4. Invest\ndirectly in real estate unless the real estate is acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other\ninstruments. This restriction shall not preclude the Fund from investing in companies that deal in real\nestate or in instruments that are backed or secured by real estate; 5. Act as an underwriter of another\nissuer's securities, except to the extent the Fund may be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of\nthe Securities Act in connection with the Fund's purchase and sale of portfolio securities; or 6. Invest in\ncommodities except as permitted by the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by\nthe SEC or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund. In addition to the investment restrictions\nadopted as fundamental policies as set forth above, the Fund observes the following restrictions, which may\nbe changed by the Board without a shareholder vote. The Fund will not: 1. Invest in the securities of a\ncompany for the purpose of exercising management or control, provided that the Trust may vote the investment\nsecurities owned by the Fund in accordance with its views; or 2. Under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of borrowings for investment purposes), directly or indirectly,\nin securities and/or other instruments comprising the index the Fund seeks to track or in instruments\nproviding exposure to securities and/or other instruments comprising the index it seeks to track. Prior to\nany change in this 80% investment policy, the Fund will provide shareholders with 60 days' notice. The Fund\ndefines the foregoing terms in accordance with the definition of such terms per the Index. If a percentage\nlimitation is adhered to at the time of investment or contract, a later increase or decrease in percentage\nresulting from any change in value or total or net assets will not result in a violation of such\nrestriction, except that the percentage limitations with respect to the borrowing of money will be observed\ncontinuously. With respect to the limitation on borrowing, in the event that a subsequent change in net\nassets or other circumstances cause the Fund to exceed its limitation, the Fund will take steps to bring the\naggregate amount of borrowing back within the limitations within three days thereafter (not including\nSundays and holidays). The 1940 Act currently permits the Fund to loan up to 33 1/3% of its total assets.\nWith respect to borrowing, the 1940 Act presently allows the Fund to: (1) borrow from any bank (including\npledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total assets, (2) borrow\nmoney for temporary purposes in an amount not exceeding 5% of the value of the Fund's total assets at the\ntime of the loan, and (3) enter into reverse repurchase agreements. However, under normal circumstances any\nborrowings by the Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. The 1940 Act generally prohibits\nfunds from issuing senior securities, although it does not treat certain transactions as senior securities,\nsuch as certain borrowings, with appropriate asset coverage. With respect to investments in commodities, the\n1940 Act presently permits the Fund to invest in commodities in accordance with investment policies\ncontained in its prospectus and SAI. Any such investment shall also comply with the CEA and the rules and\nregulations thereunder. The 1940 Act does not directly restrict an investment company's ability to invest in\nreal estate, but does require that every investment company have the fundamental investment policy governing\nsuch investments. The Fund will not purchase or sell real estate, except that the Fund may invest in\ncompanies that deal in real estate (including REITs) or in instruments that are backed or secured by real\nestate. Exchange Listing and Trading A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the Prospectus under \u201c PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION \u201d and \u201c\nADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d The discussion below supplements, and should be read in\nconjunction with, such sections of the Prospectus. The Shares of the Fund are approved for listing and\ntrading on the Exchange, subject to notice of issuance. Shares trade on the Exchange at prices that may\ndiffer to some degree from their net asset value. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of Shares of the Fund will continue to be met. The Exchange may\nconsider the suspension of trading in, and may initiate delisting proceedings of, the Shares of the Fund\nunder any of the following circumstances: (i) if the Exchange becomes aware that the Fund is no longer\neligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the 1940 Act; (ii) if the Fund no longer complies with\nthe applicable listing requirements set forth in the Exchange's rules; (iii) if, following the initial\ntwelve-month period after commencement of\n\n20\n\ntrading on the Exchange of the Fund, there are fewer than 50 beneficial holders of the Fund; or (iv) if such\nother event shall occur or condition exists which, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes further dealings on\nthe Exchange inadvisable. The Exchange will remove the Shares from listing and trading upon termination of\nthe Fund. The Trust reserves the right to adjust the Share price of the Fund in the future to maintain\nconvenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or\nreverse stock splits, which would have no effect on the net assets of the Fund or an investor's equity\ninterest in the Fund. As in the case of other publicly traded securities, brokers' commissions on\ntransactions will be based on negotiated commission rates at customary levels. The base and trading\ncurrencies of the Fund is the U.S. dollar. The base currency is the currency in which the Fund's net asset\nvalue per Share is calculated and the trading currency is the currency in which Shares of the Fund are\nlisted and traded on the Exchange. Management of the Trust The following information supplements and should\nbe read in conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c MANAGEMENT. \u201d BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe management and affairs of the Trust and its series, including the Fund described in this SAI, are\noverseen by the Trustees. The Board has approved contracts, as described in this SAI, under which certain\ncompanies provide essential management services to the Trust. Like most mutual funds, the day-to-day\nbusiness of the Trust, including the management of risk, is performed by third party service providers, such\nas the Adviser, Distributor, Administrator, and Sub-Administrator. The Trustees are responsible for\noverseeing the Trust's service providers and, thus, have oversight responsibility with respect to risk\nmanagement performed by those service providers. Risk management seeks to identify and address risks, i.e .,\nevents or circumstances that could have material adverse effects on the business, operations, shareholder\nservices, investment performance or reputation of the Fund. The Fund and its service providers employ a\nvariety of processes, procedures and controls to identify various of those possible events or circumstances,\nto lessen the probability of their occurrence and/or to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances\nif they do occur. Each service provider is responsible for one or more discrete aspects of the Trust's\nbusiness and, consequently, for managing the risks associated with that business. The Board has emphasized\nto the Fund's service providers the importance of maintaining vigorous risk management. The Trustees' role\nin risk oversight begins before the inception of the Fund, at which time the Fund's Adviser presents the\nBoard with information concerning the investment objectives, strategies and risks of the Fund, as well as\nproposed investment limitations for the Fund. Additionally, the Fund's Adviser provides the Board with an\noverview of, among other things, their investment philosophies, brokerage practices and compliance\ninfrastructures. Thereafter, the Board continues its oversight function as various personnel, including the\nTrust's Chief Compliance Officer, as well as personnel of the Adviser and other service providers, such as\nthe Fund's independent accountants, make periodic reports to the Audit Committee or to the Board with\nrespect to various aspects of risk management. The Board and the Audit Committee oversee efforts by\nmanagement and service providers to manage risks to which the Fund may be exposed. The Board is responsible\nfor overseeing the nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the Fund by the Adviser and\nreceives information about those services at its regular meetings. In addition, on an annual basis, in\nconnection with its consideration of whether to renew the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser,\nthe Board meets with the Adviser to review such services. Among other things, the Board regularly considers\nthe Adviser's adherence to the Fund's investment restrictions and compliance with various Fund policies and\nprocedures and with applicable securities regulations. The Board also reviews information about the Fund's\ninvestments. The Trust's Chief Compliance Officer reports regularly to the Board to review and discuss\ncompliance issues. At least annually, the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer provides the Board with a report\nreviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the Trust's policies and procedures and those of its service\nproviders, including the Adviser. The report addresses the operation of the policies and procedures of the\nTrust and each service provider since the date of the last report; any material changes to the policies and\nprocedures since the date of the last report; any recommendations for material changes to the policies and\nprocedures; and any material compliance matters since the date of the last report.\n\n21\n\nThe Board receives reports from the Fund's service providers regarding operational risks and risks related\nto the valuation and liquidity of portfolio securities. Regular reports are made to the Board concerning\ninvestments for which market quotations are not readily available. Annually, the independent registered\npublic accounting firm reviews with the Audit Committee its audit of the Fund's financial statements,\nfocusing on major areas of risk encountered by the Fund and noting any significant deficiencies or material\nweaknesses in the Fund's internal controls. Additionally, in connection with its oversight function, the\nBoard oversees Fund management's implementation of disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports with the SEC are\nrecorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods. The Board also oversees the\nTrust's internal controls over financial reporting, which comprise policies and procedures designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Trust's financial reporting and the\npreparation of the Trust's financial statements. From their review of these reports and discussions with the\nAdviser, the Chief Compliance Officer, the independent registered public accounting firm and other service\nproviders, the Board and the Audit Committee learn in detail about the material risks of the Fund, thereby\nfacilitating a dialogue about how management and service providers identify and mitigate those risks. The\nBoard recognizes that not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified and/or quantified, that it\nmay not be practical or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary to\nbear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Fund's goals, and that the processes,\nprocedures and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness. Moreover,\nreports received by the Trustees as to risk management matters are typically summaries of the relevant\ninformation. Most of the Fund's investment management and business affairs are carried out by or through the\nFund's Adviser and other service providers, each of which has an independent interest in risk management but\nwhose policies and the methods by which one or more risk management functions are carried out may differ\nfrom the Fund's and each other's in the setting of priorities, the resources available or the effectiveness\nof relevant controls. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Board's ability to monitor and\nmanage risk, as a practical matter, is subject to limitations. TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS There are eight members\nof the Board of Trustees, seven of whom are not interested persons of the Trust, as that term is defined in\nthe 1940 Act ( \u201c Independent Trustees \u201d ). Carl Verboncoeur, an Independent Trustee, serves as Chairman of\nthe Board. The Board has determined its leadership structure is appropriate given the specific\ncharacteristics and circumstances of the Trust. The Board made this determination in consideration of, among\nother things, the fact that the Independent Trustees constitute a super-majority (87.5%) of the Board, the\nfact that the chairperson of each Committee of the Board is an Independent Trustee, the amount of assets\nunder management in the Trust, and the number of funds overseen by the Board. The Board also believes that\nits leadership structure facilitates the orderly and efficient flow of information to the Independent\nTrustees from fund management. The Board of Trustees has two standing committees: the Audit Committee and\nTrustee Committee. The Audit Committee and Trustee Committee are each chaired by an Independent Trustee and\ncomposed of all of the Independent Trustees. Set forth below are the names, year of birth, position with the\nTrust, length of term of office, and the principal occupations during the last five years and other\ndirectorships held of each of the persons currently serving as a Trustee or Officer of the Trust.

The Board has retained authority to vote proxies for certain bank and bank\nholding company securities ( \u201c Bank Securities \u201d ) that may be held by the Fund from time to time. The Board\nhas adopted the Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc.'s ( \u201c ISS \u201d ) benchmark proxy voting policy with\nrespect to voting such Bank Securities' proxies. The Board has retained this authority in order to permit\nthe Adviser to utilize exemptions from limitations arising under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as\namended, that might otherwise prevent the Adviser from acquiring Bank Securities on behalf of the Fund. Each\nof the Trust's and the Adviser's proxy voting policies, as well as ISS' benchmark proxy voting policy, are\nattached as an appendix to this SAI. Information regarding how the Fund voted proxies relating to its\nportfolio securities during the most recent twelve-month period ended June 30 is available: (1) without\ncharge by calling 1-866-787-2257; (2) on the Fund's website at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs; and (3) on the\nSEC's website at https://www.sec.gov.

The Trust, the Adviser or\nState Street will not disseminate non-public information concerning the Trust, except information may be\nmade available prior to its public availability: (i) to a party for a legitimate business purpose related to\nthe day-to-day operations of the Fund, including (a) a service provider, (b) the stock exchanges upon which\nan ETF is listed, (c) the NSCC, (d) the Depository Trust Company, and (e) financial data/research companies\nsuch as Morningstar, Bloomberg L.P., and Reuters, or (ii) to any other party for a legitimate business or\nregulatory purpose, upon waiver or exception, with the consent of an applicable Trust officer. Investment\nAdvisory and Other Services THE INVESTMENT ADVISER SSGA FM acts as investment adviser to the Trust and,\nsubject to the oversight of the Board, is responsible for the investment management of the Fund. As of June\n30, 2024, the Adviser managed approximately $1.01 trillion in assets. The Adviser's principal address is One\nIron Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. The Adviser, a Massachusetts corporation, is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Global Advisors, Inc., which itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation, a publicly held financial holding company. State Street Global Advisors ( \u201c SSGA \u201d ),\nconsisting of the Adviser and other investment advisory affiliates of State Street Corporation, is the\ninvestment management arm of State Street Corporation. The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement ( \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d ) between the Trust and the\nAdviser. The Adviser also serves as an investment adviser to the Subsidiary pursuant to an investment\nadvisory services agreement. The Investment Advisory Agreement, with respect to the Fund, continues in\neffect for two years from its effective date, and thereafter is subject to annual approval by (1) the Board\nor (2) vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund,\nprovided that in either event such continuance also is approved by a majority of the Board who are not\ninterested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust by a vote cast in person at a meeting called\nfor the purpose of voting on such approval. The\n\n29\n\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with respect to the Fund is terminable without penalty, on 60 days' notice, by\nthe Board or by a vote of the holders of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund's outstanding\nvoting securities. The Investment Advisory Agreement is also terminable upon 60 days' notice by the Adviser\nand will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act). Under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser, subject to the oversight of the Board and in conformity with the\nstated investment policies of the Fund, manages the investment of the Fund's assets. The Adviser is\nresponsible for placing purchase and sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment\nportfolio of the Fund. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is not liable for certain\nliabilities, including certain liabilities arising under the federal securities laws, unless such loss or\nliability results from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties\nor the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties. For the services provided to the Fund under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser monthly fees based on a percentage of the Fund's\naverage daily net assets as set forth in the Fund's Prospectus. The Adviser pays all expenses of the Fund\nother than the management fee, acquired fund fees and expenses associated with holdings of acquired funds\nfor cash management purposes, brokerage expenses, taxes, interest, fees and expenses of the Independent\nTrustees (including any Trustee's counsel fees), litigation expenses and other extraordinary expenses. No\nfee will be paid to the Adviser for the advisory services that it provides to the Subsidiary. The Fund had\nnot commenced operations as of the date of this SAI and therefore did not pay fees to the Adviser for the\npast three fiscal years. A summary of the factors considered by the Board of Trustees in connection with the\ninitial approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement for the Fund will be available in the Fund's Form\nN-CSR filing with the SEC after the Fund commences operations. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS The Adviser manages the\nFund using a team of investment professionals. The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management of the Fund are Karl Schneider, Amy Cheng and Kala O'Donnell. The following table lists\nthe number and types of accounts managed by each of the key professionals involved in the day-to-day\nportfolio management for the Fund and assets under management in those accounts. The total number of\naccounts and assets have been allocated to each respective manager. Therefore, some accounts and assets have\nbeen counted twice. Other Accounts Managed as of June 30, 2024\n                                                                                                            \n  Portfolio   Registered\u2026  AssetsMana\u2026         Other  AssetsMana\u2026  OtherAccoun\u2026  AssetsMana\u2026  TotalAssets\u2026  \n  Manager                               PooledInves\u2026                                                        \n  Karl                132    $1,164.61           363      $900.10           464      $537.55     $2,602.26  \n  Schneider                                                                                                 \n  Amy Cheng           132    $1,164.61           363      $900.10           464      $537.55     $2,602.26  \n  Kala                132    $1,164.61           363      $900.10           464      $537.55     $2,602.26  \n  O'Donnell                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n* There are no performance-based fees associated with these accounts. The Fund had not commenced operations\nprior to the date of this SAI and therefore the portfolio managers did not beneficially own any Shares.\nConflicts of Interest. A portfolio manager that has responsibility for managing more than one account may be\nsubject to potential conflicts of interest because he or she is responsible for other accounts in addition\nto the Fund. Those conflicts could include preferential treatment of one account over others in terms of:\n(a) the portfolio manager's execution of different investment strategies for various accounts; or (b) the\nallocation of resources or of investment opportunities. Portfolio managers may manage numerous accounts for\nmultiple clients. These accounts may include registered investment companies, other types of pooled accounts\n(e.g., collective investment funds), and separate accounts (i.e., accounts managed on behalf of individuals\nor public or private institutions). Portfolio managers make investment decisions for each account based on\nthe investment objectives and policies and other relevant investment considerations applicable to that\nportfolio. A potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of a portfolio manager's responsibility\nfor multiple accounts with similar investment guidelines. Under these circumstances, a potential investment\nmay be suitable for more than one of the portfolio manager's accounts, but the quantity of the investment\navailable for purchase is less than the aggregate amount the accounts would ideally allocate to the\nopportunity. Similar conflicts may arise when multiple\n\n30\n\naccounts seek to dispose of the same investment. The portfolio managers may also manage accounts whose\nobjectives and policies differ from that of the Fund. These differences may be such that under certain\ncircumstances, trading activity appropriate for one account managed by the portfolio manager may have\nadverse consequences for another account managed by the portfolio manager. For example, an account may sell\na significant position in a security, which could cause the market price of that security to decrease, while\nthe Fund maintained its position in that security. A potential conflict may arise when the portfolio\nmanagers are responsible for accounts that have different advisory fees\u2014 the difference in fees could create\nan incentive for the portfolio manager to favor one account over another, for example, in terms of access to\ninvestment opportunities. This conflict may be heightened if an account is subject to a performance-based\nfee, as applicable. Another potential conflict may arise when the portfolio manager has a personal\ninvestment in one or more accounts that participate in transactions with other accounts. His or her personal\ninvestment(s) may create an incentive for the portfolio manager to favor one account over another. The\nAdviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to address these potential material\nconflicts. For instance, portfolio managers are normally responsible for all accounts within a certain\ninvestment discipline and do not, absent special circumstances, differentiate among the various accounts\nwhen allocating resources. Additionally, the Adviser and its advisory affiliates have processes and\nprocedures for allocating investment opportunities among portfolios that are designed to provide a fair and\nequitable allocation. With respect to conflicts arising from personal investments, all employees, including\nportfolio managers, must comply with personal trading controls established by each of the Adviser's and\nTrust's Code of Ethics. SSGA's culture is complemented and reinforced by a total rewards strategy that is\nbased on a pay for performance philosophy which seeks to offer a competitive pay mix of base salary,\nbenefits, cash incentives and deferred compensation. Salary is based on a number of factors, including\nexternal benchmarking data and market trends, and performance both at the business and individual level.\nSSGA's Global Human Resources department regularly participates in compensation surveys in order to provide\nSSGA with market-based compensation information that helps support individual pay decisions. Additionally,\nsubject to State Street and SSGA business results, an incentive pool is allocated to SSGA to reward its\nemployees. The size of the incentive pool for most business units is based on the firm's overall\nprofitability and other factors, including performance against risk-related goals. For most SSGA investment\nteams, SSGA recognizes and rewards performance by linking annual incentive decisions for investment teams to\nthe firm's or business unit's profitability and business unit investment performance over a multi-year\nperiod. Incentive pool funding for most active investment teams is driven in part by the post-tax investment\nperformance of fund(s) managed by the team versus the return levels of the benchmark index(es) of the\nfund(s) on a one-, three- and, in some cases, five-year basis. For most active investment teams, a material\nportion of incentive compensation for senior staff is deferred over a four-year period into the SSGA Long-\nTerm Incentive ( \u201c SSGA LTI \u201d ) program. For these teams, The SSGA LTI program indexes the performance of\nthese deferred awards against the post-tax investment performance of fund(s) managed by the team. This is\nintended to align our investment team's compensation with client interests, both through annual incentive\ncompensation awards and through the long-term value of deferred awards in the SSGA LTI program. For the\nindex equity investment team, incentive pool funding is driven in part by the post-tax 1 and 3-year tracking\nerror of the funds managed by the team against the benchmark indexes of the funds. The discretionary\nallocation of the incentive pool to the business units within SSGA is influenced by market-based\ncompensation data, as well as the overall performance of each business unit. Individual compensation\ndecisions are made by the employee's manager, in conjunction with the senior management of the employee's\nbusiness unit. These decisions are based on the overall performance of the employee and, as mentioned above,\non the performance of the firm and business unit. Depending on the job level, a portion of the annual\nincentive may be awarded in deferred compensation, which may include cash and/or Deferred Stock Awards\n(State Street stock), which typically vest over a four-year period. This helps to retain staff and further\naligns SSGA employees' interests with SSGA clients' and shareholders' long-term interests. SSGA recognizes\nand rewards outstanding performance by: \u2022 Promoting employee ownership to connect employees directly to the\ncompany's success. \u2022 Using rewards to reinforce mission, vision, values and business strategy. \u2022 Seeking to\nrecognize and preserve the firm's unique culture and team orientation. \u2022 Providing all employees the\nopportunity to share in the success of SSGA.\n\n31\n\nTHE ADMINISTRATOR, SUB-ADMINISTRATOR, CUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT Administrator: SSGA FM serves as the\nadministrator to each series of the Trust, pursuant to an Administration Agreement dated June 1, 2015 (the \u201c\nSSGA Administration Agreement \u201d ).

THE DISTRIBUTOR State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC is the\nprincipal underwriter and Distributor of Shares. Its principal address is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. Investor information can be obtained by calling 1-866-787-2257. The Distributor has\nentered into a distribution agreement ( \u201c Distribution Agreement \u201d ) with the Trust pursuant to which it\ndistributes Shares of the Fund. The Distribution Agreement will continue for two years from its effective\ndate and is renewable annually thereafter. Shares will be continuously offered for sale by the Trust through\nthe Distributor only in Creation Units, as described in the Prospectus and below under \u201c PURCHASE AND\nREDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS. \u201d Shares in less than Creation Units are not distributed by the Distributor.\nThe Distributor will deliver the Prospectus to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records\nof both orders placed with it and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it. The Distributor is a broker-\ndealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201c Exchange Act \u201d ) and a member\nof the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor has no role in determining the\ninvestment policies of the Trust or which securities are to be purchased or sold by the Trust. An affiliate\nof the Distributor may assist Authorized Participants (as defined below) in assembling shares to purchase\nCreation Units or upon redemption, for which it may receive commissions or other fees from such Authorized\nParticipants. An affiliate of the Distributor also receives compensation from State Street for providing on-\nline creation and redemption functionality to Authorized Participants through its Fund Connect application.\n\n32\n\nThe Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of the Adviser or Distributor, may directly or indirectly make\ncash payments to certain broker-dealers for participating in activities that are designed to make registered\nrepresentatives and other professionals more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the\nSPDR funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems.\nIn addition, as of the date of this SAI, the Adviser and/or Distributor had arrangements whereby they may\nmake payments, other than for the educational programs and marketing activities described above, to Pershing\nLLC ( \u201c Pershing \u201d ), RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( \u201c RBC \u201d ), LPL Financial, LLC ( \u201c LPL \u201d ), and Morgan\nStanley Wealth Management, LLC. These amounts, which may be significant, are paid by the Adviser and/or\nDistributor from their own resources and not from Fund assets. Pursuant to these arrangements, Pershing, RBC\nand LPL have agreed to offer certain SPDR funds to their customers and not to charge certain of their\ncustomers any commissions when those customers purchase or sell shares of certain SPDR funds. Payments to a\nbroker-dealer or intermediary may create potential conflicts of interest between the broker dealer or\nintermediary and its clients. In addition, the Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of the Adviser or\nDistributor, as well as an index provider that is not affiliated with the Adviser or Distributor, may\nreimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to other persons in consideration of services,\nprovision of data, or other activities that they believe may benefit the SPDR business or facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds. The Distribution Agreement provides that it may be terminated at any time, without\nthe payment of any penalty, as to the Fund: (i) by vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees or (ii) by\nvote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, on at\nleast 60 days' written notice to the Distributor. The Distribution Agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays' notice by the Distributor and will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined\nin the 1940 Act). The continuation of the Distribution Agreement and any other related agreements is subject\nto annual approval of the Board, including by a majority of the Independent Trustees, as described above.\nThe allocation among the Trust's series of fees and expenses payable under the Distribution Agreement will\nbe made pro rata in accordance with the daily net assets of the respective series. The Distributor may also\nenter into agreements with securities dealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers \u201d ) who will solicit purchases of\nCreation Unit aggregations of Shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Participating Parties (as defined\nin the \u201c Book Entry Only System \u201d section below) and/or DTC Participants (as defined below). Pursuant to the\nDistribution Agreement, the Trust has agreed to indemnify the Distributor, and may indemnify Soliciting\nDealers and Authorized Participants (as described below) entering into agreements with the Distributor, for\ncertain liabilities, including certain liabilities arising under the federal securities laws, unless such\nloss or liability results from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its\nduties or the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the Distribution Agreement or other\nagreement, as applicable. Brokerage Transactions All portfolio transactions are placed on behalf of the Fund\nby the Adviser. Purchases and sales of securities on a securities exchange are affected through brokers who\ncharge a commission for their services. Ordinarily commissions are not charged on over-the-counter orders\n(e.g., fixed income securities) because the Fund pays a spread which is included in the cost of the security\nand represents the difference between the dealer's quoted price at which it is willing to sell the security\nand the dealer's quoted price at which it is willing to buy the security. When the Fund executes an over-\nthe-counter order with an electronic communications network or an alternative trading system, a commission\nis charged by such electronic communications networks and alternative trading systems as they execute such\norders on an agency basis. Securities may be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting\nfees. In placing a portfolio transaction, the Adviser seeks to achieve best execution. The Adviser's duty to\nseek best execution requires the Adviser to take reasonable steps to obtain for the client as favorable an\noverall result as possible for Fund portfolio transactions under the circumstances, taking into account\nvarious factors that are relevant to the particular transaction.\n\n33\n\nThe Adviser refers to and selects from the list of approved trading counterparties maintained by the\nAdviser's Credit Risk Management team. In selecting a trading counterparty for a particular trade, the\nAdviser seeks to weigh relevant factors including, but not limited to the following: \u2022 Prompt and reliable\nexecution; \u2022 The competitiveness of commission rates and spreads, if applicable; \u2022 The financial strength,\nstability and/or reputation of the trading counterparty; \u2022 The willingness and ability of the executing\ntrading counterparty to execute transactions (and commit capital) of size in liquid and illiquid markets\nwithout disrupting the market for the security; \u2022 Local laws, regulations or restrictions; \u2022 The ability of\nthe trading counterparty to maintain confidentiality; \u2022 The availability and capability of execution venues,\nincluding electronic communications networks for trading and execution management systems made available to\nAdviser; \u2022 Market share; \u2022 Liquidity; \u2022 Price; \u2022 Execution related costs; \u2022 History of execution of orders;\n\u2022 Likelihood of execution and settlement; \u2022 Order size and nature; \u2022 Clearance and settlement capabilities,\nespecially in high volatility market environments; \u2022 Availability of lendable securities; \u2022 Sophistication\nof the trading counterparty's trading capabilities and infrastructure/facilities; \u2022 The operational\nefficiency with which transactions are processed and cleared, taking into account the order size and\ncomplexity; \u2022 Speed and responsiveness to the Adviser; \u2022 Access to secondary markets; \u2022 Counterparty\nexposure; and \u2022 Depending upon the circumstances, the Adviser may take other relevant factors into account\nif the Adviser believes that these are important in taking all sufficient steps to obtain the best possible\nresult for execution of the order. In selecting a trading counterparty, the price of the transaction and\ncosts related to the execution of the transaction typically merit a high relative importance, depending on\nthe circumstances. The Adviser does not necessarily select a trading counterparty based upon price and costs\nbut may take other relevant factors into account if it believes that these are important in taking\nreasonable steps to obtain the best possible result for the Fund under the circumstances. Consequently, the\nAdviser may cause a client to pay a trading counterparty more than another trading counterparty might have\ncharged for the same transaction in recognition of the value and quality of the brokerage services provided.\nThe following matters may influence the relative importance that the Adviser places upon the relevant\nfactors: (i) The nature and characteristics of the order or transaction. For example, size of order, market\nimpact of order, limits, or other instructions relating to the order; (ii) The characteristics of the\nfinancial instrument(s) or other assets which are the subject of that order. For example, whether the order\npertains to an equity, fixed income, derivative or convertible instrument; (iii) The characteristics of the\nexecution venues to which that order can be directed, if relevant. For example, availability and\ncapabilities of electronic trading systems; (iv) Whether the transaction is a \u2018delivery versus payment' or\n\u2018over-the-counter' transaction. The creditworthiness of the trading counterparty, the amount of existing\nexposure to a trading counterparty and trading counterparty settlement capabilities may be given a higher\nrelative importance in the case of \u2018over-the-counter' transactions; and/or\n\n34\n\n(v) Any other circumstances that the Adviser believes are relevant at the time. The process by which trading\ncounterparties are selected to effect transactions is designed to exclude consideration of the sales efforts\nconducted by broker-dealers in relation to the Fund. The Adviser does not currently use the Fund's assets in\nconnection with third-party soft dollar arrangements. While the Adviser does not currently use \u201c soft \u201d or\ncommission dollars paid by the Fund for the purchase of third-party research, the Adviser reserves the right\nto do so in the future. The Fund had not commenced operations as of the date of this SAI and therefore did\nnot pay brokerage commissions during the past three fiscal years. Securities of \u201c Regular Broker-Dealers \u201d :\nThe Trust is required to identify any securities of its \u201c regular brokers and dealers \u201d (as such term is\ndefined in the 1940 Act) which it may hold at the close of its most recent fiscal year. \u201c Regular brokers or\ndealers \u201d of the Trust are the ten brokers or dealers that, during the most recent fiscal year: (i) received\nthe greatest dollar amounts of brokerage commissions from the Trust's portfolio transactions; (ii) engaged\nas principal in the largest dollar amounts of portfolio transactions of the Trust; or (iii) sold the largest\ndollar amounts of the Trust's shares. The Fund had not commenced operations as of the date of this SAI and\ntherefore did not have any holdings in Securities of Regular Broker-Dealers as of October 31, 2023.\nPortfolio Turnover: Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as within a year. The Fund may\nexperience higher portfolio turnover when migrating to a different benchmark index. High turnover rates are\nlikely to result in comparatively greater brokerage expenses or transaction costs. The overall\nreasonableness of brokerage commissions and transaction costs is evaluated by the Adviser based upon its\nknowledge of available information as to the general level of commissions and transaction costs paid by\nother institutional investors for comparable services. Book Entry Only System The following information\nsupplements and should be read in conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c ADDITIONAL\nPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d The Depository Trust Company ( \u201c DTC \u201d ) acts as securities depositary for\nthe Shares. Shares of the Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee,\nCede & Co., and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. Except in the limited circumstance provided below,\ncertificates will not be issued for Shares. DTC, a limited-purpose trust company, was created to hold\nsecurities of its participants (the \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of\nsecurities transactions among the DTC Participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes\nin accounts of the DTC Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities\ncertificates. DTC Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and certain other organizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC. More\nspecifically, DTC is owned by a number of its DTC Participants and by the New York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d\n) and FINRA. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust\ncompanies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or\nindirectly (the \u201c Indirect Participants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of Shares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants.\nOwnership of beneficial interests in Shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records\nmaintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive\nfrom or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of Shares. Conveyance\nof all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to\nthe Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon\nrequest and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the Shares of the Fund held by each DTC\nParticipant. The Trust, either directly or through a third party service, shall inquire of each such DTC\nParticipant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding Shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC\nParticipant. The Trust, either directly or through a third party service, shall provide each such DTC\nParticipant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such\nplace as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that\n\n35\n\nsuch notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly,\nto such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant and/or third party\nservice a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its\nnominee, Cede & Co., as the registered holder of all Shares. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants' accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to\ntheir respective beneficial interests in Shares of the Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of Shares held through such DTC\nParticipants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a \u201c street name, \u201d and will be\nthe responsibility of such DTC Participants. The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspects of\nthe records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial ownership\ninterests in such Shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC\nParticipants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial\nOwners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may determine to discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to Shares at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities\nwith respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action either to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost or, if such a replacement is\nunavailable, to issue and deliver printed certificates representing ownership of Shares, unless the Trust\nmakes other arrangements with respect thereto satisfactory to the Exchange. Control Persons and Principal\nHolders of Securities The Fund had not commenced operations prior to the date of this SAI and therefore did\nnot have any beneficial owners that owned greater than 5% of the outstanding voting securities as of the\ndate of this SAI. An Authorized Participant (as defined below) may hold of record more than 25% of the\noutstanding Shares. From time to time, Authorized Participants may be a beneficial and/or legal owner of the\nFund, may be affiliated with an index provider, may be deemed to have control of the Fund and/or may be able\nto affect the outcome of matters presented for a vote of the shareholders of the Fund. Authorized\nParticipants may execute an irrevocable proxy granting the Distributor or another affiliate of State Street\n(the \u201c Agent \u201d ) power to vote or abstain from voting such Authorized Participant's beneficially or legally\nowned Shares. In such cases, the Agent shall mirror vote (or abstain from voting) such Shares in the same\nproportion as all other beneficial owners of the Fund. The Trustees and Officers of the Trust, as a group,\nown less than 1% of the Trust's voting securities as of the date of this SAI. Purchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units The Fund issues and redeems its Shares on a continuous basis, at net asset value, only in a\nlarge specified number of Shares called a \u201c Creation Unit. \u201d The value of the Fund is determined once each\nbusiness day as described under \u201c Determination of Net Asset Value. \u201d The Creation Unit size for the Fund\nmay change. Authorized Participants (as defined below) will be notified of such change. The principal\nconsideration for creations and redemptions for the Fund is cash, although this may be revised at any time\nwithout notice. PURCHASE (CREATION) The Trust issues and sells Shares of the Fund only: in Creation Units on\na continuous basis through the Principal Underwriter, without a sales load (but subject to transaction\nfees), at their NAV per share next determined after receipt of an order, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), in proper form pursuant to the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement ( \u201c Participant\nAgreement \u201d ). A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to the Fund is, generally, any day on which the NYSE is open\nfor business.\n\n36\n\nFUND DEPOSIT The consideration for purchase of a Creation Unit of the Fund generally consists of either (i)\nthe Deposit Securities and the Cash Component (defined below), computed as described below or (ii) the cash\nvalue of the Deposit Securities and the \u201c Cash Component, \u201d computed as described below. When accepting\npurchases of Creation Units for cash, the Fund may incur additional costs associated with the acquisition of\nDeposit Securities that would otherwise be provided by an in-kind purchaser. Together, the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, and the Cash Component constitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d which\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of the Fund. The \u201c Cash\nComponent, \u201d which may include a Dividend Equivalent Payment, is an amount equal to the difference between\nthe net asset value of the Shares (per Creation Unit) and the market value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable. The \u201c Dividend Equivalent Payment \u201d enables the Fund to make a complete\ndistribution of dividends on the day preceding the next dividend payment date, and is an amount equal, on a\nper Creation Unit basis, to the dividends on all the portfolio securities of the Fund ( \u201c Dividend\nSecurities \u201d ) with ex-dividend dates within the accumulation period for such distribution (the \u201c\nAccumulation Period \u201d ), net of expenses and liabilities for such period, as if all of the Dividend\nSecurities had been held by the Fund for the entire Accumulation Period. The Accumulation Period begins on\nthe ex-dividend date for the Fund and ends on the day preceding the next ex-dividend date. If the Cash\nComponent is a positive number (i.e., the net asset value per Creation Unit exceeds the market value of the\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash Component shall be such positive amount. If the\nCash Component is a negative number (i.e., the net asset value per Creation Unit is less than the market\nvalue of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash Component shall be such negative\namount and the creator will be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the Cash Component. The Cash\nComponent serves the function of compensating for any differences between the net asset value per Creation\nUnit and the market value of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable. Computation of the Cash\nComponent excludes any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial\nownership of the Deposit Securities, if applicable, which shall be the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below). The Custodian, through NSCC, makes available on each Business Day, prior to\nthe opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern time), the list of the names and the\nrequired number of shares of each Deposit Security or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, to\nbe included in the current standard Fund Deposit (based on information at the end of the previous Business\nDay) for the Fund. Such standard Fund Deposit is subject to any applicable adjustments as described below,\nin order to effect purchases of Creation Units of the Fund until such time as the next-announced composition\nof the Deposit Securities or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, is made available. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Deposit Securities or the amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable,\nrequired for a Fund Deposit for the Fund may be changed from time to time with a view to the investment\nobjective of the Fund. Information regarding a Fund Deposit necessary for the purchase of a Creation Unit is\nmade available to Authorized Participants and other market participants seeking to transact in Creation Unit\naggregations. As noted above, the Trust reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit\nCash to replace any Deposit Security, which shall be added to the Cash Component, including, without\nlimitation, in situations where the Deposit Security: (i) may not be available in sufficient quantity for\ndelivery, (ii) may not be eligible for transfer through the systems of DTC for corporate securities and\nmunicipal securities or the Federal Reserve System for U.S. Treasury securities; (iii) may not be eligible\nfor trading by an Authorized Participant (as defined below) or the investor for which it is acting; (iv)\nwould be restricted under the securities laws or where the delivery of the Deposit Security to the\nAuthorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant\nbecoming restricted under the securities laws, or (v) in certain other situations (collectively, \u201c non-\nstandard orders \u201d ). The Trust also reserves the right to: (i) permit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of Deposit Cash; and (ii) include or remove Deposit Securities from the basket in\nanticipation of portfolio changes. The adjustments described above will reflect changes, known to the\nAdviser on the date of announcement to be in effect by the time of delivery of the Fund Deposit, in the\ncomposition of the subject Index being tracked by the Fund or resulting from certain corporate actions.\nPROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION UNITS To be eligible to place orders with the Principal Underwriter, as\nfacilitated via the Transfer Agent, to purchase a Creation Unit of the Fund, an entity must be (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party \u201d , i.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the\nContinuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a clearing agency that is\nregistered with the SEC; or (ii) a DTC Participant (see \u201c Book Entry Only System \u201d ), and must have the\nability to clear\n\n37\n\nthrough the Federal Reserve System. In addition, each Participating Party or DTC Participant (each, an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d ) must execute a Participant Agreement that has been agreed to by the Principal\nUnderwriter and the Transfer Agent, and that has been accepted by the Trust, with respect to purchases and\nredemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of a\nParticipant Agreement, on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain\nconditions, including that it will pay to the Trust, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component\ntogether with the creation transaction fee (described below) and any other applicable fees, taxes and\nadditional variable charge. All orders to purchase Shares directly from the Fund, including non-standard\norders, must be placed for one or more Creation Units and in the manner and by the time set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement and/or the applicable order form. The date on which an order to purchase Creation\nUnits (or an order to redeem Creation Units, as set forth below) is received and accepted is referred to as\nthe \u201c Order Placement Date. \u201d An Authorized Participant may require an investor to make certain\nrepresentations or enter into agreements with respect to the order (e.g., to provide for payments of cash,\nwhen required). Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not have executed a Participant\nAgreement and that, therefore, orders to purchase Shares directly from the Fund in Creation Units have to be\nplaced by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant that has executed a Participant Agreement.\nIn such cases there may be additional charges to such investor. At any given time, there may be only a\nlimited number of broker-dealers that have executed a Participant Agreement and only a small number of such\nAuthorized Participants may have international capabilities. On days when the Exchange closes earlier than\nnormal, the Fund may require orders to create Creation Units to be placed earlier in the day. In addition,\nif a market or markets on which the Fund's investments are primarily traded is closed, the Fund will also\ngenerally not accept orders on such day(s). Orders must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant by\ntelephone or other transmission method acceptable to the Distributor pursuant to procedures set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement and in accordance with the applicable order form. Those placing orders through an\nAuthorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order by the\ncut-off time. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other communication failure may\nimpede the ability to reach the Distributor or an Authorized Participant. Fund Deposits must be delivered by\nan Authorized Participant through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. government securities), or\nthrough DTC (for corporate securities), through a subcustody agent (for foreign securities) and/or through\nsuch other arrangements allowed by the Trust or its agents. With respect to foreign Deposit Securities, the\nCustodian shall cause the subcustodian of the Fund to maintain an account into which the Authorized\nParticipant shall deliver, on behalf of itself or the party on whose behalf it is acting, such Deposit\nSecurities. Foreign Deposit Securities must be delivered to an account maintained at the applicable local\nsubcustodian. The Fund Deposit transfer must be ordered by the Authorized Participant in a timely fashion so\nas to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, to\nthe account of the Fund or its agents by no later than the Settlement Date. The \u201c Settlement Date \u201d with\nrespect to a creation order for the Fund is generally the first Business Day ( \u201c T+1 \u201d ) after the Order\nPlacement Date. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as\napplicable, and the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any\ntendered securities or cash, as applicable, will be determined by the Trust, whose determination shall be\nfinal and binding. The amount of cash represented by the Cash Component must be transferred directly to the\nCustodian through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by\nthe Custodian no later than the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, are not received in a timely manner by the Settlement Date, the creation order may be\ncancelled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such cancelled order may be resubmitted the following\nBusiness Day using a Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Fund. The\ndelivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no later than the first Business Day following\nthe day on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor. The order shall be deemed to be\nreceived on the Business Day on which the order is placed provided that the order is placed in proper form\nprior to the applicable cut-off time and the federal funds in the appropriate amount are deposited by 2:00\np.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions), with the Custodian on the Settlement Date. If\nthe order is not placed in proper form as required, or federal funds in the appropriate amount are not\nreceived by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00\n\n38\n\np.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions) on the Settlement Date, then the order may be deemed to be\nrejected and the Authorized Participant shall be liable to the Fund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom.\nA creation request is considered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if all procedures set forth in the Participant\nAgreement, order form and this SAI are properly followed. Shortened settlement cycles are expected to be\navailable, through which creation transactions can be settled on the trade date in accordance with\ninstructions provided by the Trust and/or Distributor. ISSUANCE OF A CREATION UNIT Except as provided\nherein, Creation Units will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the Trust of the Deposit\nSecurities or payment of Deposit Cash, as applicable, and the payment of the Cash Component have been\ncompleted. When the subcustodian has confirmed to the Custodian that the required Deposit Securities (or the\ncash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the relevant subcustodian or subcustodians, the\nPrincipal Underwriter and the Adviser shall be notified of such delivery, and the Trust will issue and cause\nthe delivery of the Creation Units. In instances where the Trust accepts Deposit Securities for the purchase\nof a Creation Unit, the Creation Unit may be purchased in advance of receipt by the Trust of all or a\nportion of the applicable Deposit Securities as described below. In these circumstances, the initial deposit\nwill have a value greater than the net asset value of the Shares on the date the order is placed in proper\nform since in addition to available Deposit Securities, cash must be deposited in an amount equal to the sum\nof (i) the Cash Component, plus (ii) an additional amount of cash equal to a percentage of the market value\nas set forth in the Participant Agreement, of the undelivered Deposit Securities (the \u201c Additional Cash\nDeposit \u201d ), which shall be maintained in a general non-interest bearing collateral account. An additional\namount of cash shall be required to be deposited with the Trust, pending delivery of the missing Deposit\nSecurities to the extent necessary to maintain the Additional Cash Deposit with the Trust in an amount at\nleast equal to the applicable percentage, as set forth in the Participant Agreement, of the daily marked to\nmarket value of the missing Deposit Securities. The Trust may use such Additional Cash Deposit to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time. Authorized Participants will be liable to the Trust for all costs,\nexpenses, dividends, income and taxes associated with missing Deposit Securities, including the costs\nincurred by the Trust in connection with any such purchases. These costs will be deemed to include the\namount by which the actual purchase price of the Deposit Securities exceeds the market value of such Deposit\nSecurities on the day the purchase order was deemed received by the Principal Underwriter plus the brokerage\nand related transaction costs associated with such purchases. The Trust will return any unused portion of\nthe Additional Cash Deposit once all of the missing Deposit Securities have been properly received by the\nCustodian or purchased by the Trust and deposited into the Trust. In addition, a transaction fee as set\nforth below under \u201c Creation Transaction Fees \u201d will be charged in all cases and an additional variable\ncharge may also be applied. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no later than the\nSettlement Date. ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF CREATION UNITS The Trust reserves the right to reject an order for\nCreation Units transmitted in respect of the Fund at its discretion, including, without limitation, if (a)\nthe order is not in proper form or the Deposit Securities delivered do not consist of the securities that\nthe Custodian specified; (b) the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, delivered by the\nAuthorized Participant are not as disseminated through the facilities of the NSCC for that date by the\nCustodian; (c) the investor(s), upon obtaining the Shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently\noutstanding Shares of the Fund; (d) the acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be\nunlawful; (e) the acceptance or receipt of the order for a Creation Unit would, in the opinion of counsel to\nthe Trust, be unlawful; or (f) in the event that circumstances outside the control of the Trust, the\nCustodian, the Transfer Agent, the Distributor and/or the Adviser make it for all practical purposes not\nfeasible to process orders for Creation Units. Examples of such circumstances include acts of God or public\nservice or utility problems such as fires, floods, extreme weather conditions and power outages resulting in\ntelephone, telecopy and computer failures; market conditions or activities causing trading halts; systems\nfailures involving computer or other information systems affecting the Trust, the Principal Underwriter, the\nCustodian, the Transfer Agent, DTC, NSCC, Federal Reserve System, or any other participant in the creation\nprocess, and other extraordinary events. The Trust or its agents shall communicate to the Authorized\nParticipant its rejection of an order. The Trust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian and the Principal\nUnderwriter are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the\ndelivery of Fund Deposits nor shall either of them incur any liability for the failure to give any such\n\n39\n\nnotification. The Trust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian and the Principal Underwriter shall not be liable\nfor the rejection of any purchase order for Creation Units. Given the importance of the ongoing issuance of\nCreation Units to maintaining a market price that is at or close to the underlying net asset value of the\nFund, the Trust does not intend to suspend acceptance of orders for Creation Units. All questions as to the\nnumber of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and\nacceptance for deposit of any securities to be delivered shall be determined by the Trust, and the Trust's\ndetermination shall be final and binding. REDEMPTION Shares may be redeemed only in Creation Units at their\nnet asset value next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Fund through the\nTransfer Agent and only on a Business Day. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE FUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM\nSHARES IN AMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION UNITS. Investors must accumulate enough Shares in the secondary market\nto constitute a Creation Unit in order to have such Shares redeemed by the Trust. There can be no assurance,\nhowever, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the public trading market at any time to permit assembly\nof a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling\na sufficient number of Shares to constitute a redeemable Creation Unit. With respect to the Fund, the\nCustodian, through the NSCC, makes available prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently\n9:30 a.m. Eastern time) on each Business Day, the list of the names and share quantities of securities\ndesignated by the Fund that will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption\nrequests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day ( \u201c Redemption Securities \u201d ). Redemption\nSecurities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities. The identity and number of\nshares of the Redemption Securities or the Cash Redemption Amount (defined below) may be changed from time\nto time with a view to the investment objective of the Fund. Redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit are\npaid either in-kind or in cash, or a combination thereof, as determined by the Trust. With respect to in-\nkind redemptions of the Fund, redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit will consist of Redemption Securities\nplus cash in an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the Fund Shares being\nredeemed, as next determined after a receipt of a request in proper form, and the value of the Redemption\nSecurities (the \u201c Cash Redemption Amount \u201d ), less a fixed redemption transaction fee and any applicable\nadditional variable charge as set forth below. In the event that the Redemption Securities have a value\ngreater than the net asset value of the Fund Shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the differential\nis required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, at the Trust's discretion, an Authorized Participant may receive the corresponding cash value\nof the securities in lieu of the in-kind securities value representing one or more Redemption Securities.\nPROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS After the Trust has deemed an order for redemption received, the\nTrust will initiate procedures to transfer the requisite Redemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to the Authorized Participant by the Settlement Date. The \u201c Settlement Date \u201d with respect to a\nredemption order for the Fund is generally T+1. With respect to in-kind redemptions of the Fund, the\ncalculation of the value of the Redemption Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to be delivered upon\nredemption will be made by the Custodian according to the procedures set forth under \u201c Determination of Net\nAsset Value \u201d , computed on the Business Day on which a redemption order is deemed received by the Trust.\nTherefore, if a redemption order in proper form is submitted to the Principal Underwriter by a DTC\nParticipant by the specified time on the Order Placement Date, and the requisite number of Shares of the\nFund are delivered to the Custodian prior to 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, then the value of the Redemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to be delivered will be determined by the Custodian on such Order Placement Date. If the requisite\nnumber of Shares of the Fund are not delivered by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, the Fund will not release the underlying securities for delivery\nunless collateral is posted in such percentage amount of missing Shares as set forth in the Participant\nAgreement (marked to market daily). With respect to in-kind redemptions of the Fund, in connection with\ntaking delivery of shares of Redemption Securities upon redemption of Creation Units, an Authorized\nParticipant must maintain appropriate custody arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other\ncustody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the Redemption Securities are\n\n40\n\ncustomarily traded (or such other arrangements as allowed by the Trust or its agents), to which account such\nRedemption Securities will be delivered. Delivery of redemption proceeds is generally T+1. The order form\nspecifies the date at which the delivery of redemption proceeds for the Fund is generally expected to occur.\nDue to the schedule of holidays in certain countries, however, the delivery of in-kind redemption proceeds\nmay take longer than one Business Day after the day on which the redemption request is received in proper\nform. If the Authorized Participant has not made appropriate arrangements to take delivery of the Redemption\nSecurities in the applicable foreign jurisdiction and it is not possible to make other such arrangements, or\nif it is not possible to effect deliveries of the Redemption Securities in such jurisdiction, the Trust may,\nin its discretion, exercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash, and the Authorized Participant will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. If it is not possible to make other such arrangements,\nor if it is not possible to effect deliveries of the Redemption Securities, the Trust may in its discretion\nexercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash, and the redeeming investor will be required to receive\nits redemption proceeds in cash. In addition, an investor may request a redemption in cash that the Fund\nmay, in its sole discretion, permit. In either case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the\nNAV of its Shares based on the NAV of Shares of the Fund next determined after the redemption request is\nreceived in proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and additional charge for requested cash\nredemptions specified above, to offset the Trust's brokerage and other transaction costs associated with the\ndisposition of Redemption Securities). The Fund may also, in its sole discretion, upon request of a\nshareholder, provide such redeemer a portfolio of securities that differs from the exact composition of the\nRedemption Securities but does not differ in net asset value. An Authorized Participant submitting a\nredemption request is deemed to represent to the Trust that, as of the close of the Business Day on which\nthe redemption request was submitted, it (or its client) will own (within the meaning of Rule 200 of\nRegulation SHO) or has arranged to borrow for delivery to the Trust on or prior to the Settlement Date of\nthe redemption request, the requisite number of Shares of the Fund to be redeemed as a Creation Unit. In\neither case, the Authorized Participant is deemed to acknowledge that: (i) it (or its client) has full legal\nauthority and legal right to tender for redemption the requisite number of Shares of the Fund and to receive\nthe entire proceeds of the redemption; and (ii) if such Shares submitted for redemption have been loaned or\npledged to another party or are the subject of a repurchase agreement, securities lending agreement or any\nother arrangement affecting legal or beneficial ownership of such Shares being tendered, there are no\nrestrictions precluding the tender and delivery of such Shares (including borrowed shares, if any) for\nredemption, free and clear of liens, on the redemption Settlement Date. The Trust reserves the right to\nverify these representations at its discretion, but will typically require verification with respect to a\nredemption request from the Fund in connection with higher levels of redemption activity and/or short\ninterest in the Fund. If the Authorized Participant, upon receipt of a verification request, does not\nprovide sufficient verification of its representations as determined by the Trust, the redemption request\nwill not be considered to have been received in proper form and may be rejected by the Trust. Redemptions of\nShares for Redemption Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable federal and state securities\nlaws and the Fund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem\nCreation Units for cash to the extent that the Trust could not lawfully deliver specific Redemption\nSecurities upon redemptions or could not do so without first registering the Redemption Securities under\nsuch laws. An Authorized Participant or an investor for which it is acting subject to a legal restriction\nwith respect to a particular security included in the Redemption Securities applicable to the redemption of\nCreation Units may be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The Authorized Participant may request the\nredeeming investor of the Shares to complete an order form or to enter into agreements with respect to such\nmatters as compensating cash payment. Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a \u201c qualified\ninstitutional buyer, \u201d ( \u201c QIB \u201d ) as such term is defined under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, will not\nbe able to receive Redemption Securities that are restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.\nAn Authorized Participant may be required by the Trust to provide a written confirmation with respect to QIB\nstatus in order to receive Redemption Securities. The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of\npayment postponed with respect to the Fund (1) for any period during which the Exchange is closed (other\nthan customary weekend and holiday closings); (2) for any period during which trading on the Exchange is\nsuspended or restricted; (3) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal\nof the Shares of the Fund or determination of the NAV of the Shares is not reasonably practicable; or (4) in\nsuch other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\n\n41\n\nCREATION AND REDEMPTION TRANSACTION FEES A transaction fee, as set forth in the table below, is imposed for\nthe transfer and other transaction costs associated with the purchase or redemption of Creation Units, as\napplicable. Authorized Participants will be required to pay a fixed creation transaction fee and/or a fixed\nredemption transaction fee, as applicable, on a given day regardless of the number of Creation Units created\nor redeemed on that day. The Fund may adjust the transaction fee from time to time. An additional charge or\na variable charge (discussed below) will be applied to certain creation and redemption transactions,\nincluding non-standard orders and whole or partial cash purchases or redemptions. With respect to creation\norders, Authorized Participants are responsible for the costs of transferring the securities constituting\nthe Deposit Securities to the account of the Trust and with respect to redemption orders, Authorized\nParticipants are responsible for the costs of transferring the Redemption Securities from the Trust to their\naccount or on their order. Investors who use the services of a broker or other such intermediary may also be\ncharged a fee for such services. Creation and Redemption Transaction Fees:\n                                                                                               \n  Fund                                          TransactionFee*,**  MaximumTransactionFee*,**  \n  SPDR Bloomberg Enhanced Roll Yield Commodity                $100                       $400  \n  Strategy No K-1 ETF                                                                          \n                                                                                               \n* From time to time, the Fund may waive all or a portion of its applicable transaction fee(s). An additional\ncharge of up to three (3) times the standard transaction fee may be charged to the extent a transaction is\noutside of the clearing process. ** In addition to the transaction fees listed above, the Fund may charge an\nadditional variable fee for creations and redemptions in cash to offset brokerage and impact expenses\nassociated with the cash transaction. The variable transaction fee will be calculated based on historical\ntransaction cost data and the Adviser's view of current market conditions; however, the actual variable fee\ncharged for a given transaction may be lower or higher than the trading expenses incurred by the Fund with\nrespect to that transaction. Determination of Net Asset Value The following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the sections in the Prospectus entitled \u201c PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION \u201d\nand \u201c ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d NAV per Share for the Fund is computed by dividing the\nvalue of the net assets of the Fund (i.e., the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the\ntotal number of Shares outstanding. Expenses and fees, including the management fees, are accrued daily and\ntaken into account for purposes of determining NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by State Street and\ndetermined once daily as of the close of the regular trading session on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m.\nEastern time) on each day that such exchange is open. Creation/redemption order cut-off times may be earlier\non any day that the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (or applicable exchange or market\non which the Fund's investments are traded) announces an early closing time. Any assets or liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at market rates on the\ndate of valuation (generally as of 4:00 p.m. London time) as quoted by one or more sources. In calculating\nthe Fund's net asset value per Share, the Fund's investments are generally valued using market valuations. A\nmarket valuation generally means a valuation (i) obtained from an exchange, a pricing service, or a major\nmarket maker (or dealer) or (ii) based on a price quotation or other equivalent indication of value supplied\nby an exchange, a pricing service, or a major market maker (or dealer). The Fund relies on a third-party\nservice provider for assistance with the daily calculation of the Fund's NAV. The third-party service\nprovider, in turn, relies on other parties for certain pricing data and other inputs used in the calculation\nof the Fund's NAV. Therefore, the Fund is subject to certain operational risks associated with reliance on\nits service provider and that service provider's sources of pricing and other data. NAV calculation may be\nadversely affected by operational risks arising from factors such as errors or failures in systems and\ntechnology. Such errors or failures may result in inaccurately calculated NAVs, delays in the calculation of\nNAVs and/or the inability to calculate NAV over extended time periods. The Fund may be unable to recover any\nlosses associated with such failures. In the case of shares of other funds that are not traded on an\nexchange, a market valuation means such fund's published net asset value per share. The Fund may use various\npricing services, or discontinue the use of any pricing service. Fixed-income assets are generally valued as\nof the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange,\nand generally 4:00 p.m. EST for U.S. fixed-income assets. Fixed-income assets are generally valued at the\nmean of the bid and ask prices for bank loans and inflation protected securities, and at the bid price for\nall other fixed-income assets.\n\n42\n\nPursuant to Board approved valuation procedures, the Board has designated the Adviser as the valuation\ndesignee for the Fund. These procedures address, among other things, (i) determining (a) when market\nquotations are not readily available or reliable and (b) the methodologies to be used for determining the\nfair value of investments, and (ii) the use and oversight of third-party pricing services for fair\nvaluation. The Adviser is responsible for periodically reviewing the procedures, and the selected\nmethodologies used, for their continuing appropriateness and accuracy, and making any changes or adjustments\nto the procedures and methodologies as appropriate. In the event that current market valuations are not\nreadily available or are deemed unreliable, the Trust's procedures require the Adviser to determine a\nsecurity's fair value. In determining a fair value, the Adviser may consider, among other things, (i) price\ncomparisons among multiple sources, (ii) a review of corporate actions and news events, and (iii) a review\nof relevant financial indicators (e.g., movement in interest rates, market indices, and prices from the\nFund's Index provider). In these cases, the Fund's net asset value may reflect certain portfolio securities'\nfair values rather than their market prices. The fair value of a portfolio instrument is generally the price\nwhich the Fund might reasonably expect to receive upon its current sale in an orderly market between market\nparticipants. Ascertaining fair value requires a determination of the amount that an arm's-length buyer,\nunder the circumstances, would currently pay for the portfolio instrument. Fair value pricing involves\nsubjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value determination for a security is materially\ndifferent than the value that could be realized upon the sale of the security. In addition, fair value\npricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's net asset value and the\nprices used by the Index. This may result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance\nof the Index. Dividends and Distributions The following information supplements and should be read in\nconjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c DISTRIBUTIONS. \u201d GENERAL POLICIES Dividends from\nnet investment income, if any, are generally declared and paid monthly by the Fund. Distributions of net\nrealized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make\ndistributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund to improve index tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, in all events in a manner consistent with the\nprovisions of the 1940 Act. Dividends and other distributions on Shares are distributed, as described below,\non a pro rata basis to Beneficial Owners of such Shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC Participants\nand Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners then of record with proceeds received from the Trust.\nManagement of the Trust reserves the right to declare special dividends if, in its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or advisable to preserve the Fund's eligibility for treatment as a RIC under the\nInternal Revenue Code or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes at the Fund level. DIVIDEND\nREINVESTMENT Broker dealers, at their own discretion, may offer a dividend reinvestment service under which\nShares are purchased in the secondary market at current market prices. Investors should consult their broker\ndealer for further information regarding any dividend reinvestment service offered by such broker dealer.\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain federal income tax considerations generally affecting the Fund\nand its shareholders that supplements the discussions in the Prospectus. No attempt is made to present a\ncomprehensive explanation of the federal, state, local or foreign tax treatment of the Fund or its\nshareholders, and the discussion here and in each Prospectus is not intended to be a substitute for careful\ntax planning. The following general discussion of certain federal income tax consequences is based on the\nInternal Revenue Code and the regulations issued thereunder as in effect on the date of this SAI. New\nlegislation, as well as administrative changes or court decisions, may significantly change the conclusions\nexpressed herein, and may have a retroactive effect with respect to the transactions contemplated herein.\n\n43\n\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c\nADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION. \u201d TAXATION OF THE FUND The Fund is treated as a separate corporation for federal\nincome tax purposes. The Fund therefore is considered to be a separate entity in determining its treatment\nunder the rules for RICs described herein and in the Prospectus. Losses in one series of the Trust do not\noffset gains in any other series of the Trust and the requirements (other than certain organizational\nrequirements) for qualifying for treatment as a RIC are determined at the Fund level rather than at the\nTrust level. The Fund has elected or will elect and intends to qualify each year to be treated as a separate\nRIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. As such, the Fund should not be subject to federal\nincome tax on its net investment income and capital gains, if any, to the extent that it timely distributes\nsuch income and capital gains to its shareholders. In order to qualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund must\ndistribute annually to its shareholders at least the sum of 90% of its taxable net investment income\n(generally including the excess of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses) and 90%\nof its net tax-exempt interest income, if any (the \u201c Distribution Requirement \u201d ) and also must meet several\nadditional requirements. Among these requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of the Fund's gross\nincome each taxable year must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain\nsecurities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or\nother income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and\nnet income derived from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships (the \u201c Qualifying Income\nRequirement \u201d ); and (ii) at the end of each quarter of the Fund's taxable year, its assets must be\ndiversified so that (a) at least 50% of the market value of its total assets must be represented by cash and\ncash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited, in respect to any one issuer, to an amount not greater in value than 5% of the value of\nthe Fund's total assets and to not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and\n(b) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S.\ngovernment securities or securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, the securities (other than securities\nof other RICs) of two or more issuers that it controls and that are engaged in the same, similar, or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the \u201c\nDiversification Requirement \u201d ). If the Fund fails to satisfy the Qualifying Income Requirement or the\nDiversification Requirement in any taxable year, the Fund may be eligible for relief provisions if the\nfailures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid with respect to\neach failure to satisfy the applicable requirements. Additionally, relief is provided for certain de minimis\nfailures of the Diversification Requirement where the Fund corrects the failure within a specified period of\ntime. In order to be eligible for the relief provisions with respect to a failure to meet the\nDiversification Requirement, the Fund may be required to dispose of certain assets. If these relief\nprovisions were not available to the Fund and it were to fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC for a\ntaxable year, all of its taxable income would be subject to tax at the applicable corporate rate without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders, and its distributions (including capital gains distributions)\ngenerally would be taxable as ordinary income dividends to its shareholders, subject to the dividends-\nreceived deduction for corporate shareholders and the lower tax rates on qualified dividend income received\nby noncorporate shareholders. To requalify for treatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, the Fund\nwould be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and to distribute any earnings\nand profits from any year in which the Fund failed to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. If the Fund failed\nto qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, it would generally be required to pay a\nFund-level tax on certain net built-in gains recognized with respect to certain of its assets upon a\ndisposition of such assets within five years of qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year. The Board reserves\nthe right not to maintain the qualification of the Fund for treatment as a RIC if it determines such course\nof action to be beneficial to shareholders. As discussed more fully below, the Fund intends to distribute\nsubstantially all of its net investment income and its capital gains for each taxable year. If the Fund\nmeets the Distribution Requirement but retains some or all of its income or gains, it will be subject to\nfederal income tax to the extent any such income or gains are not distributed. The Fund may designate\ncertain amounts retained as undistributed net capital gain in a notice to its shareholders, who (i) will be\nrequired to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed amount so designated, (ii) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the income tax paid by the Fund on that undistributed amount against their federal\nincome tax liabilities and to claim refunds to the extent such credits exceed their liabilities and (iii)\nwill be entitled to increase their tax basis, for federal income tax purposes, in their Shares by an amount\nequal to the excess of\n\n44\n\nthe amount of undistributed net capital gain included in their respective income over their respective\nincome tax credits. If the Fund failed to satisfy the Distribution Requirement for any taxable year, it\nwould be taxed as a regular corporation, with consequences generally similar to those described in the\npreceding paragraph. It may not be possible for the Fund to fully implement sampling methodologies while\nsatisfying the Diversification Requirement. The Fund's efforts to satisfy the Diversification Requirement\nmay affect the Fund's execution of its investment strategy and may cause the Fund's return to deviate from\nthat of the Index, and the Fund's efforts to track the Index may cause it inadvertently to fail to satisfy\nthe Diversification Requirement. The Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income\nif it does not distribute to its shareholders in each calendar year an amount at least equal to 98% of its\nordinary income for the calendar year plus 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the twelve months ended\nOctober 31 of such year, subject to an increase for any shortfall in the prior year's distribution. The Fund\nintends to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to\navoid the application of this 4% excise tax. The Fund may elect to treat part or all of any \u201c qualified late\nyear loss \u201d as if it had been incurred in the succeeding taxable year in determining the Fund's taxable\nincome, net capital gain, net short-term capital gain, and earnings and profits. The effect of this election\nis to treat any such \u201c qualified late year loss \u201d as if it had been incurred in the succeeding taxable year\nin characterizing Fund distributions for any calendar year. A \u201c qualified late year loss \u201d generally\nincludes net capital loss, net long-term capital loss, or net short-term capital loss incurred after October\n31 of the current taxable year (commonly referred to as \u201c post-October losses \u201d ) and certain other late-\nyear losses. Capital losses in excess of capital gains ( \u201c net capital losses \u201d ) are not permitted to be\ndeducted against a RIC's net investment income. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, potentially\nsubject to certain limitations, the Fund may carry a net capital loss from any taxable year forward\nindefinitely to offset its capital gains, if any, in years following the year of the loss. To the extent\nsubsequent capital gains are offset by such losses, they will not result in U.S. federal income tax\nliability to the Fund and may not be distributed as capital gains to its shareholders. Generally, the Fund\nmay not carry forward any losses other than net capital losses. TAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014DISTRIBUTIONS The\nFund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders substantially all of its investment company taxable\nincome (computed without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), its net tax-exempt income, if any, and\nany net capital gain (net recognized long-term capital gains in excess of net recognized short-term capital\nlosses, taking into account any capital loss carryforwards). The Fund will report to shareholders annually\nthe amounts of dividends paid from ordinary income and the amount of distributions of net capital gain.\nSince the Fund primarily holds investments that do not pay dividends, it is not expected that a substantial\nportion (if any) of the dividends paid by the Fund will qualify for either the dividends-received deduction\nfor corporations or the favorable income tax rates available to individuals on qualified dividend income.\nDistributions from the Fund's net short-term capital gains will generally be taxable to shareholders as\nordinary income. Distributions from the Fund's net capital gain will be taxable to shareholders at long-term\ncapital gains rates, regardless of how long shareholders have held their Shares. Long-term capital gains are\ngenerally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Although dividends generally will be treated\nas distributed when paid, any dividend declared by the Fund in October, November or December and payable to\nshareholders of record in such a month that is paid during the following January will be treated for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes as received by shareholders on December 31 of the calendar year in which it was\ndeclared. If the Fund's distributions exceed its earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions\nmade in the taxable year may be treated as a return of capital to shareholders. A return of capital\ndistribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's cost basis and result in a\nhigher capital gain or lower capital loss when the Shares on which the distribution was received are sold.\nAfter a shareholder's basis in the Shares has been reduced to zero, distributions in excess of earnings and\nprofits will be treated as gain from the sale of the shareholder's Shares. Under Section 163(j) of the Code,\na taxpayer's business interest expense is generally deductible to the extent of its business interest income\nplus certain other amounts. If the Fund earns business interest income, it may report a portion of its\ndividends as \u201c Section 163(j) interest dividends, \u201d which its shareholders may be able to treat as business\ninterest income for purposes of Section 163(j) of the Code. The Fund's \u201c Section 163(j) interest dividend \u201d\nfor a tax year will be\n\n45\n\nlimited to the excess of its business interest income over the sum of its business interest expense and\nother deductions properly allocable to its business interest income. In general, the Fund's shareholders may\ntreat a distribution reported as a Section 163(j) interest dividend as interest income only to the extent\nthe distribution exceeds the sum of the portions of the distribution reported as other types of tax-favored\nincome. To be eligible to treat a Section 163(j) interest dividend as interest income, a shareholder may\nneed to meet certain holding period requirements in respect of Fund Shares and must not have hedged its\nposition in Fund Shares in certain ways. Distributions that are reinvested in additional Shares of the Fund\nthrough the means of a dividend reinvestment service, if offered by your broker-dealer, will nevertheless be\ntaxable dividends to the same extent as if such dividends had been received in cash. A 3.8% Medicare\ncontribution tax generally applies to all or a portion of the net investment income of a shareholder who is\nan individual and not a nonresident alien for federal income tax purposes and who has adjusted gross income\n(subject to certain adjustments) that exceeds a threshold amount ($250,000 if married filing jointly or if\nconsidered a \u201c surviving spouse \u201d for federal income tax purposes, $125,000 if married filing separately,\nand $200,000 in other cases). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of the undistributed net\ninvestment income of certain shareholders that are estates and trusts. For these purposes, interest,\ndividends and certain capital gains (generally including capital gain distributions and capital gains\nrealized on the sale of Shares) are generally taken into account in computing a shareholder's net investment\nincome. Distributions of ordinary income and capital gains may also be subject to foreign, state and local\ntaxes depending on a shareholder's circumstances. TAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014SALE OF SHARES In general, a sale\nof Shares results in capital gain or loss, and for individual shareholders, is taxable at a federal rate\ndependent upon the length of time the Shares were held. A sale of Shares held for a period of one year or\nless at the time of such sale will, for tax purposes, generally result in short-term capital gains or\nlosses, and a sale of those held for more than one year will generally result in long-term capital gains or\nlosses. Long-term capital gains are generally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Gain or\nloss on the sale of Shares is measured by the difference between the amount received and the adjusted tax\nbasis of the Shares. Shareholders should keep records of investments made (including Shares acquired through\nreinvestment of dividends and distributions) so they can compute the tax basis of their Shares. A loss\nrealized on a sale of Shares may be disallowed if substantially identical Shares are acquired (whether\nthrough the reinvestment of dividends or otherwise) within a sixty-one (61) day period beginning thirty (30)\ndays before and ending thirty (30) days after the date that the Shares are disposed of. In such a case, the\nbasis of the Shares acquired must be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss upon the sale of\nShares held for six (6) months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of any\namounts treated as distributions to the shareholder of long-term capital gain (including any amounts\ncredited to the shareholder as undistributed capital gains). COST BASIS REPORTING The cost basis of Shares\nacquired by purchase will generally be based on the amount paid for the Shares and then may be subsequently\nadjusted for other applicable transactions as required by the Internal Revenue Code. The difference between\nthe selling price and the cost basis of Shares generally determines the amount of the capital gain or loss\nrealized on the sale or exchange of Shares. Contact the broker through whom you purchased your Shares to\nobtain information with respect to the available cost basis reporting methods and elections for your\naccount. TAXATION OF FUND INVESTMENTS Dividends and interest received by the Fund on foreign securities may\ngive rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by foreign countries. Tax conventions between certain\ncountries and the United States may reduce or eliminate such taxes. The Fund does not expect to satisfy the\nrequirements for passing through to its shareholders any share of any foreign taxes paid by the Fund, with\nthe result that shareholders will not include such taxes in their gross incomes and will not be entitled to\na tax deduction or credit for such taxes on their own returns. Certain of the Fund's investments may be\nsubject to complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to hedging\ntransactions, straddles, integrated transactions, foreign currency contracts, forward foreign currency\ncontracts, and notional principal contracts) that, among other things, may affect the character of gains and\nlosses realized by the Fund (e.g., may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of\n\n46\n\nincome to the Fund and defer losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These provisions also may require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types of\npositions in its portfolio (i.e., treat them as if they were closed out) which may cause the Fund to\nrecognize income without receiving cash with which to make distributions to its shareholders in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the RIC distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. The Fund\nintends to monitor its transactions, intends to make appropriate tax elections, and intends to make\nappropriate entries in its books and records in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and preserve the\nFund's qualification for treatment as a RIC. Certain investments made by the Fund may be treated as equity\nin passive foreign investment companies or \u201c PFICs \u201d for federal income tax purposes. In general, a passive\nforeign investment company is a foreign corporation (i) that receives at least 75% of its annual gross\nincome from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, certain rents and royalties, or capital gains) or\n(ii) where at least 50% of its assets (computed based on average fair market value) either produce or are\nheld for the production of passive income. If the Fund acquires any equity interest (under Treasury\nregulations that may be promulgated in the future, generally including not only stock but also an option to\nacquire stock such as is inherent in a convertible bond) in a PFIC, the Fund could be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax and nondeductible interest charges on \u201c excess distributions \u201d received from such\ncompanies or on gain from the sale of stock in such companies, even if all income or gain actually received\nby the Fund is timely distributed by the Fund to its shareholders. The Fund would not be able to pass\nthrough to its shareholders any credit or deduction for such a tax. A \u201c qualified electing fund \u201d election\nor a \u201c mark to market \u201d election may be available that would ameliorate these adverse tax consequences, but\nsuch elections could require the Fund to recognize taxable income or gain (subject to the distribution\nrequirements applicable to RICs, as described above) without the concurrent receipt of cash. In order to\nsatisfy the distribution requirements and avoid a tax at the Fund level, the Fund may be required to\nliquidate portfolio securities that it might otherwise have continued to hold, potentially resulting in\nadditional taxable gain or loss to the Fund. Gains from the sale of stock of PFICs may also be treated as\nordinary income. In order for the Fund to make a qualified electing fund election with respect to a PFIC,\nthe PFIC would have to agree to provide certain tax information to the Fund on an annual basis, which it\nmight not agree to do. The Fund may limit and/or manage its holdings in PFICs to limit its tax liability or\nmaximize its returns from these investments. If a sufficient portion of the interests in a foreign issuer\nare held or deemed held by the Fund, independently or together with certain other U.S. persons, that issuer\nmay be treated as a \u201c controlled foreign corporation \u201d (a \u201c CFC \u201d ) with respect to the Fund, in which case\nthe Fund will be required to take into account each year, as ordinary income, its share of certain portions\nof that issuer's income, whether or not such amounts are distributed. The Fund may have to dispose of its\nportfolio securities (potentially resulting in the recognition of taxable gain or loss, and potentially\nunder disadvantageous circumstances) to generate cash, or may have to borrow the cash, to meet its\ndistribution requirements and avoid Fund-level taxes. In addition, some Fund gains on the disposition of\ninterests in such an issuer may be treated as ordinary income. The Fund may limit and/or manage its holdings\nin issuers that could be treated as CFCs in order to limit its tax liability or maximize its after-tax\nreturn from these investments. The Fund is required for federal income tax purposes to mark-to-market and\nrecognize as income for each taxable year its net unrealized gains and losses on certain futures contracts\nas of the end of the year as well as those actually realized during the year. Gain or loss from futures and\noptions contracts on broad-based indexes required to be marked to market will be 60% long-term and 40%\nshort-term capital gain or loss. Application of this rule may alter the timing and character of\ndistributions to shareholders. The Fund may be required to defer the recognition of losses on futures\ncontracts, options contracts and swaps to the extent of any unrecognized gains on offsetting positions held\nby the Fund. It is anticipated that certain net gain realized from the closing out of futures or options\ncontracts will be considered gain from the sale of securities and therefore will be qualifying income for\npurposes of the Qualifying Income Requirement. Investments by the Fund in zero coupon or other discount\nsecurities will result in income to the Fund equal to a portion of the excess face value of the securities\nover their issue price (the \u201c original issue discount \u201d or \u201c OID \u201d ) each year that the securities are held,\neven though the Fund may receive no cash interest payments or may receive cash interest payments that are\nless than the income recognized for tax purposes. In other circumstances, whether pursuant to the terms of a\nsecurity or as a result of other factors outside the control of the Fund, the Fund may recognize income\nwithout receiving a commensurate amount of cash. Such income is included in determining the amount of income\nthat the Fund must distribute to maintain its eligibility for treatment as a RIC and to avoid the payment of\nfederal income tax, including the nondeductible 4% excise tax described above.\n\n47\n\nAny market discount recognized on a market discount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount\nbond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value, or below adjusted issue\nprice if issued with original issue discount. Absent an election by the Fund to include the market discount\nin income as it accrues, gain on the Fund's disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary\nincome rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount. Where the income required to\nbe recognized as a result of the OID and/or market discount rules is not matched by a corresponding cash\nreceipt by the Fund, the Fund may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to enable the Fund to\nmake distributions to its shareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a RIC and eliminate taxes at the\nFund level. Special rules apply if the Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds, such as Treasury Inflation-\nProtected Securities (TIPS). Generally, all stated interest on inflation-indexed bonds is taken into income\nby the Fund under its regular method of accounting for interest income. The amount of any positive inflation\nadjustment for a taxable year, which results from an increase in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of\nthe bond, is treated as OID. The amount of the Fund's OID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will\nincrease the Fund's taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until the bond\nmatures. As a result, the Fund may need to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distribution\nrequirements for the applicable year. The amount of any negative inflation adjustments, which result from a\ndecrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, first reduces the amount of interest\n(including stated interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includable in the Fund's taxable\nincome with respect to the bond for the taxable year; any remaining negative adjustments will be either\ntreated as ordinary loss or, in certain circumstances, carried forward to reduce the amount of interest\nincome taken into account with respect to the bond in future taxable years. The Fund invests a portion of\nits assets (not to exceed 25% of its assets) in the Subsidiary, which is classified as a corporation for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. Because the Subsidiary is a foreign corporation that is wholly owned by\nthe Fund, the Subsidiary is a CFC, and the Fund is considered a \u201c United States shareholder \u201d thereof. As a\nresult, the Fund is required to include in its gross income each taxable year all of the Subsidiary's \u201c\nsubpart F income, \u201d which generally is treated as ordinary income. It is expected that virtually all of the\nSubsidiary's income will be \u201c subpart F income. \u201d If the Subsidiary realizes a net loss, that loss generally\nwould not be available to offset the Fund's income. The Fund's inclusion of the Subsidiary's \u201c subpart F\nincome \u201d in its gross income increases the Fund's tax basis in its shares of the Subsidiary. Distributions\nby the Subsidiary to the Fund are generally not taxable to the extent of its previously undistributed \u201c\nsubpart F income \u201d and reduce the Fund's tax basis in those shares. Under applicable regulations, the Fund's\nsubpart F income inclusions in respect of the Subsidiary will constitute qualifying income for the Fund,\nwhether or not any amount is distributed by the Subsidiary to the Fund, if the subpart F income inclusions\nare derived with respect to the Fund's business of investing in stock, securities or currencies. The Fund\nhas received an opinion of counsel, which is not binding on the IRS or the courts, that the subpart F income\ninclusion the Fund derives from the Subsidiary should constitute qualifying income. It is possible that the\nIRS might take the position that subpart F income inclusions from the Subsidiary are not qualifying income.\nUnder those circumstances the Fund might fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC. If the Fund failed to\nqualify as a RIC for any taxable year and was ineligible to or otherwise did not cure the failure, it would\nbe subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate, with the consequence that\nits income available for distribution to shareholders would be reduced and all such distributions from its\ncurrent or accumulated earnings and profits would be taxable to its shareholders. Based on applicable\nregulations, the Fund expects its subpart F income inclusions from the Subsidiary to be qualifying income.\nIn the future, if the IRS issues regulations or other guidance, or Congress enacts legislation, limiting the\ncircumstances in which the Fund's subpart F income inclusions from the Subsidiary will be considered\nqualifying income, the Fund might be required to make changes to its operations, which could reduce the\nFund's ability to gain investment exposure to commodities. Fund shareholders could also experience adverse\ntax consequences in such circumstances. In that event, the Trust's Board may authorize a significant change\nin investment strategy or the Fund's liquidation. TAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS Certain tax-exempt shareholders,\nincluding qualified pension plans, individual retirement accounts, salary deferral arrangements, 401(k)\nplans, and other tax-exempt entities, generally are exempt from federal income taxation except with respect\nto their unrelated business taxable income ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ). Under current law, the Fund generally serves to\nblock UBTI from being realized by its tax-exempt shareholders. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, tax-\nexempt shareholders could realize UBTI by virtue of their investment in the Fund where, for example, (i) the\nFund invests in REITs that hold residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits ( \u201c REMICs \u201d\n) or (ii) Shares constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt shareholders within the\nmeaning of section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n48\n\nCharitable remainder trusts are subject to special rules and should consult their tax advisors. The IRS has\nissued guidance with respect to these issues and prospective shareholders, especially charitable remainder\ntrusts, are strongly encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding these issues. Certain tax-\nexempt educational institutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on net investment income. For these purposes,\ncertain dividends and capital gain distributions, and certain gains from the disposition of Shares (among\nother categories of income), are generally taken into account in computing a shareholder's net investment\nincome. FOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS Dividends, other than capital gains dividends, \u201c short-term capital gain\ndividends \u201d and \u201c interest-related dividends \u201d (described below), paid by the Fund to shareholders who are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities will be subject to a 30% United States withholding tax unless a\nreduced rate of withholding or a withholding exemption is provided under applicable treaty law to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term capital gain or unless such income is effectively connected\nwith a U.S. trade or business carried on through a permanent establishment in the United States. Nonresident\nshareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the applicability of the United States\nwithholding tax and the proper withholding form(s) to be submitted to the Fund. A non-U.S. shareholder who\nfails to provide an appropriate IRS Form W-8 may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.\nDividends reported by the Fund as (i) interest-related dividends, to the extent such dividends are derived\nfrom the Fund's \u201c qualified net interest income, \u201d or (ii) short-term capital gain dividends, to the extent\nsuch dividends are derived from the Fund's \u201c qualified short-term gain, \u201d are generally exempt from this 30%\nwithholding tax. \u201c Qualified net interest income \u201d is the Fund's net income derived from U.S.-source\ninterest and original issue discount, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. \u201c Qualified short-term\ngain \u201d generally means the excess of the Fund's net short-term capital gain for the taxable year over its\nnet long-term capital loss, if any. In the case of Shares held through an intermediary, the intermediary may\nwithhold even if the Fund reports the payment as an interest-related dividend or as a short-term capital\ngain dividend. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of\nthese rules to their accounts. Unless certain non-U.S. entities that hold Shares comply with IRS\nrequirements that will generally require them to report information regarding U.S. persons investing in, or\nholding accounts with, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may apply to Fund distributions payable to such\nentities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the withholding described in this paragraph under an\napplicable intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and a foreign government, provided that the\nshareholder and the applicable foreign government comply with the terms of such agreement. BACKUP\nWITHHOLDING The Fund will be required in certain cases to withhold (as \u201c backup withholding \u201d ) on amounts\npayable to any shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund either an incorrect tax identification number or no\nnumber at all, (2) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report payments of\ninterest or dividends, (3) has failed to certify to the Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident\nalien). The backup withholding rate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will not be applied to payments\nthat have been subject to the 30% withholding tax on shareholders who are neither citizens nor permanent\nresidents of the U.S. CREATION UNITS An Authorized Participant who exchanges securities for Creation Units\ngenerally will recognize a gain or a loss. The gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the\nmarket value of the Creation Units at the time and the sum of the exchanger's aggregate basis in the\nsecurities surrendered plus the amount of cash paid for such Creation Units. A person who redeems Creation\nUnits will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the exchanger's basis in the\nCreation Units and the sum of the aggregate market value of any securities received plus the amount of any\ncash received for such Creation Units. The IRS, however, may assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units cannot be deducted currently under the rules governing \u201c wash sales, \u201d or on\nthe basis that there has been no significant change in economic position. Any gain or loss realized upon a\ncreation of Creation Units will be treated as capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the\nsecurities exchanged therefor as capital assets, and otherwise will be ordinary income or loss. Similarly,\nany gain or loss realized upon a redemption of Creation Units will be treated as capital gain or loss if the\nAuthorized Participant holds the Shares comprising the Creation Units as capital assets, and otherwise will\nbe ordinary\n\n49\n\nincome or loss. Any capital gain or loss realized upon the creation of Creation Units will generally be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss if the securities exchanged for such Creation Units have been held\nfor more than one year, and otherwise will be short-term capital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon the redemption of Creation Units will generally be treated as long-term capital gain or loss\nif the Shares comprising the Creation Units have been held for more than one year, and otherwise, will\ngenerally be short-term capital gain or loss. Any capital loss realized upon a redemption of Creation Units\nheld for six (6) months or less will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any amounts\ntreated as distributions to the applicable Authorized Participant of long-term capital gains with respect to\nthe Creation Units (including any amounts credited to the Authorized Participant as undistributed capital\ngains). The Fund has the right to reject an order for Creation Units if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the\nFund and if, pursuant to section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund would have a basis in any\ndeposit securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. The Fund also\nhas the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial Share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If the Fund does issue Creation Units to a purchaser (or a group of purchasers) that\nwould, upon obtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the Fund, the\npurchaser (or a group of purchasers) may not recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of securities for\nCreation Units. If the Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear additional costs and recognize more\ncapital gains than it would if it redeems Creation Units in kind. Persons purchasing or redeeming Creation\nUnits should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax treatment of any creation or redemption\ntransaction. CERTAIN POTENTIAL TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Under promulgated Treasury regulations, if a\nshareholder recognizes a loss on disposition of the Fund's shares of $2 million or more for an individual\nshareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder (or certain greater amounts over a\ncombination of years), the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886.\nDirect shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement, but\nunder current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not excepted. A shareholder who fails to make the required\ndisclosure to the IRS may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including significant penalties. The fact\nthat a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer's treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisers to determine the\napplicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances. The foregoing discussion is a\nsummary only and is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning. Purchasers of Shares should\nconsult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of investing in such Shares, including under\nstate, local and other tax laws. Finally, the foregoing discussion is based on applicable provisions of the\nInternal Revenue Code, regulations, judicial authority and administrative interpretations in effect on the\ndate hereof. Changes in applicable authority could materially affect the conclusions discussed above, and\nsuch changes often occur. STATE TAX MATTERS The discussion of state and local tax treatment is based on the\nassumptions that the Fund will qualify for treatment under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code as RICs\nand that the Fund will distribute all interest and dividends it receives to its shareholders. The tax\ndiscussion summarizes general state and local tax laws which are currently in effect and which are subject\nto change by legislative, judicial or administrative action; any such changes may be retroactive with\nrespect to the Fund's applicable transactions. Investors should consult a tax advisor for more detailed\ninformation about state and local taxes to which they may be subject. Many states grant tax-free status to\ndividends paid to you from interest earned on direct obligations of the U.S. government, subject in some\nstates to minimum investment requirements that must be met by the Fund. Investment in Government National\nMortgage Association ( \u201c Ginnie Mae \u201d ) or Federal National Mortgage Association ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d )\nsecurities, banker's acceptances, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities do not generally qualify for such tax-free treatment. The rules on exclusion of this\nincome are different for corporate shareholders.\n\n50\n\nCapital Stock and Other Securities The Fund issues Shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per Share.\nThe Board may designate additional funds. Each Share issued by the Trust has a pro rata interest in the\nassets of the corresponding series of the Trust. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or\nconversion rights and are freely transferable. Each Share is entitled to participate equally in dividends\nand distributions declared by the Board with respect to the Fund, and in the net distributable assets of the\nFund on liquidation. Each Share has one vote with respect to matters upon which a shareholder vote is\nrequired consistent with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Shares of\nall series of the Trust ( \u201c Funds \u201d ) vote together as a single class except that if the matter being voted\non affects only a particular fund it will be voted on only by that fund and if a matter affects a particular\nfund differently from other Funds, that fund will vote separately on such matter. Under Massachusetts law,\nthe Trust is not required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940\nAct. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under\nthe 1940 Act. All Shares of the Trust (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative voting rights for the\nelection of Trustees. Under Massachusetts law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders. Under Massachusetts law, shareholders of a business trust may, under certain circumstances, be\nheld personally liable as partners for obligations of the Trust. However, the Declaration of Trust contains\nan express disclaimer of shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the Trust, requires that Trust\nobligations include such disclaimer, and provides for indemnification and reimbursement of expenses out of\nthe Trust's property for any shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the Trust. Thus, the\nrisk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to\ncircumstances in which the Trust itself would be unable to meet its obligations. Given the above limitations\non shareholder personal liability, and the nature of the Fund's assets and operations, the risk to\nshareholders of personal liability is believed to be remote. Shareholder inquiries may be made by writing to\nthe Trust, c/o the Distributor, State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC at One Iron Street,\nBoston, Massachusetts 02210. Counsel and Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Morgan, Lewis &\nBockius LLP, located at 1111 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004, serves as counsel to the Trust.\nErnst & Young LLP, located at 200 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, serves as the independent\nregistered public accounting firm of the Trust. Ernst & Young LLP performs annual audits of the Fund's\nfinancial statements and provides other audit, tax and related services. Local Market Holiday Schedules The\nTrust generally intends to effect deliveries of the Funds' portfolio securities on T+1. The ability of the\nTrust to effect in-kind redemptions within one Business Day of receipt of a redemption request is subject,\namong other things, to the condition that, within the time period from the date of the request to the date\nof delivery of the securities, there are no days that are local market holidays on the relevant Business\nDays. For every occurrence of one or more intervening holidays in the local market that are not holidays\nobserved in the United States, the redemption settlement cycle may be extended by the number of such\nintervening local holidays. In addition to holidays, other unforeseeable closings in a foreign market due to\nemergencies may also prevent the Trust from delivering securities within one Business Day. The securities\ndelivery cycles currently practicable for transferring portfolio securities to redeeming investors, coupled\nwith local market holiday schedules, may require a delivery process longer than the standard settlement\nperiod. In certain circumstances during the calendar year, the settlement period may be greater than seven\ncalendar days. Financial Statements The Fund had not commenced operations as of the date of this SAI and\ntherefore does not have financial information to report for the Fund's October 31, 2023 fiscal year end.\n\n51\n\nAPPENDIX A Standard & Poor's, a division of S&P Global ( \u201c S&P \u201d ), Long-Term Issue Ratings:\n                                                                                                            \n                         An obligation rated \u2018AAA' has the highest rating assigned by S&P Global Ratings.   \n  AAA                    The obligor'scapacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation is       \n                         extremely strong.                                                                  \n                         An obligation rated \u2018AA' differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a      \n  AA                     small degree. Theobligor's capacity to meet its financial commitments on the       \n                         obligation is very strong.                                                         \n                         An obligation rated \u2018A' is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of     \n  A                      changes incircumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated   \n                         categories. However,the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitments on    \n                         the obligation is still strong.                                                    \n                         An obligation rated \u2018BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However,        \n  BBB                    adverse economicconditions or changing circumstances are more likely to weaken     \n                         the obligor's capacity to meetits financial commitments on the obligation.         \n                         Obligations rated \u2018BB', \u2018B', \u2018CCC', \u2018CC', and \u2018C' are regarded as having           \n                         significant speculativecharacteristics. \u2018BB' indicates the least degree of         \n  BB, B, CCC, CC, and C  speculation and \u2018C' the highest. While suchobligations will likely have some       \n                         quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighedby large            \n                         uncertainties or major exposure to adverse conditions.                             \n                         An obligation rated \u2018BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative   \n  BB                     issues.However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse        \n                         business, financial, oreconomic conditions that could lead to the obligor's        \n                         inadequate capacity to meet its financialcommitments on the obligation.            \n                         An obligation rated \u2018B' is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated    \n                         \u2018BB', but theobligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments  \n  B                      on the obligation. Adversebusiness, financial, or economic conditions will likely  \n                         impair the obligor's capacity or willingnessto meet its financial commitments on   \n                         the obligation.                                                                    \n                         An obligation rated \u2018CCC' is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent   \n                         uponfavorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to      \n  CCC                    meet its financialcommitments on the obligation. In the event of adverse           \n                         business, financial, or economicconditions, the obligor is not likely to have the  \n                         capacity to meet its financial commitments on theobligation.                       \n                         An obligation rated \u2018CC' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The \u2018CC'    \n  CC                     rating is usedwhen a default has not yet occurred but S&P Global Ratings expects   \n                         default to be a virtualcertainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default.   \n                         An obligation rated \u2018C' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the      \n  C                      obligation isexpected to have lower relative seniority or lower ultimate recovery  \n                         compared with obligationsthat are rated higher.                                    \n                         An obligation rated \u2018D' is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For      \n                         non-hybrid capitalinstruments, the \u2018D' rating category is used when payments on    \n                         an obligation are not made onthe date due, unless S&P Global Ratings believes      \n                         that such payments will be made within fivebusiness days in the absence of a       \n  D                      stated grace period or within the earlier of the stated graceperiod or 30          \n                         calendar days. The \u2018D' rating also will be used upon the filing of a               \n                         bankruptcypetition or the taking of similar action and where default on an         \n                         obligation is a virtual certainty, forexample due to automatic stay provisions. A  \n                         rating on an obligation is lowered to \u2018D' if it issubject to a distressed debt     \n                         restructuring.                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n* Ratings from \u2018AA' to \u2018CCC' may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show\nrelative standing within the rating categories.\n\nA-1\n\nMoody's Investors Service, Inc.'s ( \u201c Moody's \u201d ) Long-Term Obligation Ratings:\n                                                                                                            \n  Aaa  Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of        \n       credit risk.                                                                                         \n  Aa   Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.       \n  A    Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.          \n  Baa  Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such  \n       maypossess certain speculative characteristics.                                                      \n  Ba   Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.        \n  B    Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.                  \n  Caa  Obligations rated Caa are judged to be speculative of poor standing and are subject to very high     \n       credit risk.                                                                                         \n  Ca   Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some      \n       prospect of recoveryof principal and interest.                                                       \n  C    Obligations rated C are the lowest rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for      \n       recovery of principal orinterest.                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nNote: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating classification from Aa through\nCaa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category;\nthe modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of\nthat generic rating category. Additionally, a \u201c (hyb) \u201d indicator is appended to all ratings of hybrid\nsecurities issued by banks, insurers, finance companies, and securities firms.* Note: For more information\non long-term ratings assigned to obligations in default, please see the definition \u201c Long-Term Credit\nRatings for Defaulted or Impaired Securities \u201d in the Other Definitions section of Moody's Rating Symbols\nand Definitions publication. * By their terms, hybrid securities allow for the omission of scheduled\ndividends, interest, or principal payments, which can potentially result in impairment if such an omission\noccurs. Hybrid securities may also be subject to contractually allowable write-downs of principal that could\nresult in impairment. Together with the hybrid indicator, the long-term obligation rating assigned to a\nhybrid security is an expression of the relative credit risk associated with that security. Fitch Ratings\nLtd.'s ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ) Corporate Finance Obligations \u2013 Long-Term Ratings: AAA: Highest Credit Quality. \u2018AAA'\nratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally\nstrong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely\naffected by foreseeable events. AA: Very High Credit Quality. \u2018AA' ratings denote expectations of very low\ncredit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not\nsignificantly vulnerable to foreseeable events. A: High Credit Quality. \u2018A' ratings denote expectations of\nlow credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may,\nnevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher\nratings. BBB: Good Credit Quality. \u2018BBB' ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently\nlow. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate, but adverse business or\neconomic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity. BB: Speculative. \u2018BB' ratings indicate an\nelevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic\nconditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial\ncommitments to be met.

In this regard, the Adviser will consider, at least annually, among other things, the adequacy and\nquality of the proxy advisory firm's staffing and personnel and the robustness of its policies and\nprocedures regarding its ability to identify and address any conflicts of interest.

We       \n                                     expect companies to observe the relevant laws and regulations of       \n  Regional Nuances                   their respective markets, as well as country specific best practice    \n                                     guidelines and corporate governance codes and to publicly disclose     \n                                     their level of compliance with the applicable provisions and           \n                                     requirements. Except where specified, this Policy applies globally.    \n  Our Proxy Voting and Engagement    We have organized our proxy voting and engagement program around       \n  Principles                         three broad principles:                                                \n                                     We believe that well-governed companies can protect and pursue         \n                                     shareholder interests better and withstand the challenges of an        \n                                     uncertain economic environment. As such, we seek to vote director      \n                                     elections in a way that we believe will maximize long-term value.      \n                                     Principally, a board acts on behalf of shareholders by protecting      \n                                     their interests and preserving their rights. In order to carry out     \n                                     their primary responsibilities, directors undertake activities that    \n                                     include setting strategy and providing guidance on strategic matters,  \n                                     selecting the CEO and other senior executives, overseeing executive    \n                                     management, creating a succession plan for the board and management,   \n                                     and providing effective oversight of material risks and opportunities  \n                                     relevant to their business. Further, good corporate governance         \n                                     necessitates the existence of effective internal controls and risk     \n  Effective Board Oversight          management systems, which should be governed by the board. \u00a0 We view   \n                                     board quality as a measure of director independence, director          \n                                     succession planning, board diversity, evaluations and refreshment,     \n                                     and company governance practices. We believe independent directors     \n                                     are crucial to good corporate governance; they help management         \n                                     establish sound corporate governance policies and practices. We        \n                                     believe a sufficiently independent board is key to effectively         \n                                     monitoring management, maintaining appropriate governance practices,   \n                                     and performing oversight functions necessary to protect shareholder    \n                                     interests. We also believe the right mix of skills, independence,      \n                                     diversity, and qualifications among directors provides boards with     \n                                     the knowledge and direct experience to manage risks and operating      \n                                     structures that are often complex and industry-specific. We vote for   \n                                     the (re-)election of directors on a case-by-case basis after           \n                                     considering various                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nC-6                                                                                                         \n     \n  7  \n     \n                                                                                                            \n                            factors set forth in this Policy, including, but not limited to, board          \n                            quality, general market practice, and availability of information on director   \n                            skills and expertise. When voting in director elections, we do so on behalf of  \n                            and in the best interest of the funds and client accounts we manage and do not  \n                            seek to change or influence control of the company.                             \n                            It is important for shareholders to receive timely and accurate reporting of a  \n                            company\u2019s financial performance and strategy so that they are able to assess    \n                            both the value and risk of their investment. In addition to information         \n                            related to strategy and performance, companies should also provide disclosure   \n  Disclosure                relating to their approach to corporate governance and shareholder rights.      \n                            Such information allows investors to determine whether their economic           \n                            interests have been protected by the board and provides insights into the       \n                            quality of the board\u2019s oversight of management. Ultimately, the board of        \n                            directors is accountable for the oversight and disclosure of the material       \n                            risks and opportunities faced by the company.                                   \n                            State Street Global Advisors believes it is in the best interest of             \n                            shareholders for companies to have appropriate shareholder rights and           \n                            accountability mechanisms in place. As a starting place for voting rights, it   \n                            is necessary for ownership rights to reflect one vote for one share to ensure   \n                            that economic interests and proxy voting power are aligned. This share          \n                            structure best supports the shareholders\u2019 right to exercise their proxy vote    \n                            on matters that are important to the protection of their investment such as     \n  Shareholder Protection    share issuances and other dilutive events, authorization of strategic           \n                            transactions, approval of a shareholder rights plan, and changes to the         \n                            corporate bylaws or charter, among others. In terms of accountability           \n                            mechanisms, we believe there should be annual elections of the full board of    \n                            directors. The ability to elect, remove and nominate directors on at least an   \n                            annual basis provides the appropriate checks and balances to ensure that the    \n                            board of directors are undertaking their responsibilities in the best           \n                            interests of their shareholders.                                                \n                            When voting our clients\u2019 proxies, we may be presented with shareholder          \n                            proposals at portfolio companies that must be evaluated on a case-by-case       \n  Shareholder Proposals     basis and in accordance with the principles set forth above. For proposals      \n                            related to commonly requested disclosure topics, we have also developed the     \n                            criteria found in Appendix A to assess the effectiveness of disclosure on such  \n                            topics in connection with these types of proposals.                             \n                            State Street Global Advisors\u2019 engagement activities provides a meaningful       \n                            shareholder tool that we believe protects and enhances the long-term economic   \n                            value of the holdings in our clients\u2019 accounts. We conduct issuer-specific      \n  Engagement                engagements with companies to discuss the principles set forth in this Policy,  \n                            including sustainability-related risks and opportunities. In addition, we       \n                            encourage issuers to increase the amount of direct communication board members  \n                            have with shareholders.

We believe a sufficiently      \n                                          independent board is key to effectively monitoring management,    \n                                          maintaining appropriate governance practices, and performing      \n  Board Independence                      oversight functions necessary to protect shareholder interests.   \n                                          We have developed a set of criteria for determining board         \n                                          independence, which varies by region and/or local jurisdiction.   \n                                          These criteria generally follow relevant listing standards,       \n                                          local regulatory requirements and/or local market practice        \n                                          standards.

In assessing excessive tenure, we consider factors such   \n                       as the preponderance of long tenured directors, board refreshment practices, and     \n                       classified board structures.                                                         \n                       Generally, we may vote against age and term limits unless the company is found to    \n                       have poor board refreshment and director succession practices, and has a             \n                       preponderance of non-executive directors with excessively long tenures serving on    \n                       the board.                                                                           \n                       Director Time Commitments We consider if a company publicly discloses its director   \n                       time commitment policy (e.g., within corporate governance guidelines, proxy          \n                       statement, company website).

Boards should also have a regular        \n                          evaluation process in place to assess the effectiveness of the board and the      \n                          skills of board members to address issues, such as emerging risks, changes to     \n                          corporate strategy, and diversification of operations and geographic footprint.   \n                          We believe nominating committees are best positioned to evaluate the skillset     \n                          and expertise of both existing and prospective board members. However, we may     \n                          take such considerations into account in certain circumstances, such as           \n                          contested elections.                                                              \n                          Oversight of Strategy and Risk We believe that risk management is a key function  \n                          of the board, which is responsible for setting the overall risk appetite of a     \n                          company and for providing oversight on the risk management process established    \n                          by senior executives at a company. We allow boards to have discretion regarding   \n  Board Accountability    the ways in which they provide oversight in this area. However, we expect         \n                          companies to disclose how the board provides oversight on its risk management     \n                          system and risk identification. Boards should also review existing and emerging   \n                          risks that evolve in tandem with the changing political and economic landscape    \n                          or as companies diversify or expand their operations into new areas.              \n                          As responsible stewards, we believe in the importance of effective risk           \n                          management and oversight of issues that are material to a company. To             \n                          effectively manage and assess the risk of our clients\u2019 portfolios, we expect our  \n                          portfolio companies to manage risks and opportunities that are material and       \n                          industry-specific and that have a demonstrated link to long-term value creation,  \n                          and to provide high-quality disclosure of this process to shareholders.           \n                          Consistent with this perspective, we may seek to engage with our portfolio        \n                                                                                                            \nC-11                                                                                                        \n      \n  12  \n      \n                                                      \n  companies to better understand how their boards     \n  are overseeing risks and opportunities the company  \n  has deemed to be material to its business or        \n  operations. If we believe that a company has        \n  failed to implement and communicate effective       \n  oversight of these risks, we may consider voting    \n  against the responsible directors. We may withhold  \n  votes from directors who we determine have been     \n  remiss in their duties.                             \n  We may vote against directors due to failure to     \n  demonstrate effective oversight in the following    \n  three areas for relevant companies:                 \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aGovernance                                       \n  \u2022 Climate risk management at companies in           \n  carbon-intensive industries5 or companies           \n  receiving shareholder proposals that exhibit        \n  significant misalignment with our TCFD disclosure   \n  assessment criteria                                 \n  \u2022 Human capital management at our largest global    \n  holdings                                            \n  When evaluating a board\u2019s oversight of risks and    \n  opportunities, we assess the following factors,     \n  based on disclosures by, and engagements with,      \n  portfolio companies:                                \n                                                      \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aOversees Long-term Strategy                      \n  \u2014 Articulates the material risks and opportunities  \n  and how those risks and opportunities fit into the  \n  firm\u2019s long-term business strategy                  \n  \u2014 Regularly assesses the effectiveness of the       \n  company\u2019s long-term strategy, and management\u2019s      \n  execution of this strategy                          \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aDemonstrates an Effective Oversight Process      \n  \u2014 Describes which committee(s) have oversight over  \n  specific risks and opportunities, as well as which  \n  topics are overseen and/or discussed at the         \n  full-board level                                    \n  \u2014 Includes risks and opportunities in board and/or  \n  committee agendas, and articulates how often        \n  specific topics are discussed at the committee      \n  and/or full-board level                             \n  5 State Street Global Advisors defines              \n  carbon-intensive industries as the following        \n  Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)      \n  subindustries:                                      \n  Electric Utilities, Integrated Oil &Gas,            \n  Multi-Utilities, Steel, Construction Materials,     \n  Independent Power Producers & Energy Traders, Oil   \n  & Gas Refining & Marketing, Oil & Gas Exploration   \n  & Production, Diversified Metals & Mining,          \n  Airlines, Commodity Chemicals, Industrial Gases,    \n  Aluminum, Oil & Gas Storage & Transportation,       \n  Multi-Sector Holdings, Diversified Chemicals,       \n  Fertilizers & Agricultural Chemicals, Air Freight   \n  & Logistics, Agricultural Products, Environmental   \n  & Facilities Services, Coal & Consumable Fuels,     \n  Paper Packaging, Railroads, Marine, Automotive      \n  Retail, Oil & Gas Drilling, Food Retail, Paper      \n  Products, Hotels, Resorts & Cruise Lines, Internet  \n  & Direct Marketing Retail, Hypermarkets &           \n  Supercenters, Precious Metals & Minerals.           \n                                                      \nC-12                                                                                                        \n      \n  13  \n      \n                                                      \n  \u2014 Utilizes KPIs or metrics to assess the            \n  effectiveness of risk management processes          \n  \u2014 Engages with key stakeholders including           \n  employees and investors                             \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aEnsures Effective Leadership                     \n  \u2014 Holds management accountable for progress on      \n  relevant metrics and targets                        \n  \u2014 Integrates necessary skills and perspectives      \n  into the board nominating and executive hiring      \n  processes, and provides training to directors and   \n  executives on topics material to the company\u2019s      \n  business or operations                              \n  \u2014\u2009\u2009Conducts a periodic effectiveness review         \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aEnsures Disclosures of Material Information      \n  \u2014 Ensures publication of relevant disclosures,      \n  including those regarding material topics           \n  \u2014 For example, we expect companies to disclose      \n  against the four pillars of the Task Force on       \n  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)        \n  framework.                                          \n  Proxy Contests We believe nominating committees     \n  that are comprised of independent directors are     \n  best placed to assess which individuals can         \n  properly fulfill the duties of the board, and act   \n  as effective fiduciaries. As long-term              \n  shareholders, we vote proxies in director           \n  elections, including related to nominating          \n  committee members, who play a critical role in      \n  determining board composition. While our default    \n  position is to support the committees\u2019 judgement,   \n  we consider the following factors when evaluating   \n  dissident nominees:                                 \n                                                      \n  \u2022 Strategy presented by dissident nominees versus   \n  that of current management, as overseen by the      \n  incumbent board                                     \n  \u2022 Effectiveness, quality, and experience of the     \n  management slate                                    \n  \u2022 Material governance failures and the level of     \n  responsiveness to shareholder concerns and market   \n  signals by the incumbent board                      \n  \u2022 Quality of disclosure and engagement practices    \n  to support changes to shareholder rights, capital   \n  allocation and/or governance structure              \n  \u2022 Company performance and, if applicable, the       \n  merit of a recovery plan                            \n  Board Oversight of Geopolitical Risk As stewards    \n  of our clients\u2019 assets, we are aware of the         \n  financial risks associated with geopolitical risk,  \n  including risks arising from unexpected conflict    \n  between or among nations.

Despite the        \n  differences among the possible types of plans and   \n  the awards, there is a simple underlying            \n  philosophy that guides our analysis of executive    \n  compensation:                                       \n  we believe that there should be a direct            \n  relationship between executive compensation and     \n  company performance over the long term.             \n  Shareholders should have the opportunity to assess  \n  whether pay structures and levels are aligned with  \n  business performance. When assessing remuneration   \n  reports, we consider factors such as adequate       \n  disclosure of various remuneration elements,        \n  absolute and relative pay levels, peer selection    \n  and benchmarking, the mix of long-term and          \n  short-term incentives, alignment of pay structures  \n  with shareholder interests, as well as with         \n  corporate strategy and performance. We may oppose   \n  remuneration reports where pay seems misaligned     \n  with shareholders\u2019 interests. We may also consider  \n  executive compensation practices when re-electing   \n  members of the compensation committee.              \n  For example, criteria we may consider include the   \n  following:                                          \n                                                      \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aOverall quantum relative to company performance  \n  \u2022 Vesting periods and length of performance         \n  targets                                             \n  \u2022 Mix of performance, time and options-based stock  \n  units                                               \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aUse of special grants and one-time awards        \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aRetesting and repricing features                 \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aDisclosure and transparency                      \n  Board Responsiveness to Advisory Votes              \n  a. Executive Pay                                    \n  We may vote against the re-election of members of   \n  the compensation committee if we have serious       \n  concerns about remuneration practices and if the    \n  company has not been responsive to shareholder      \n  feedback to review its approach. In addition, if    \n  the level of dissent against a management proposal  \n  on executive pay is consistently high, and we have  \n  determined that a vote against a pay-related        \n  proposal is warranted in the third consecutive      \n  year, we may vote against the Chair of the          \n  compensation committee.                             \n                                                      \nC-14                                                                                                        \n      \n  15  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n                                   b.

As a         \n  result, we have a longstanding commitment to        \n  enhancing investor-useful disclosure around this    \n  topic.                                              \n  We find that the recommendations of the Taskforce   \n  on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)     \n  provide an effective framework for disclosure of    \n  climate-related risks and opportunities. We         \n  believe all companies should provide public         \n  disclosures in accordance with the following four   \n  pillars of the Taskforce for Climate-related        \n  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework:             \n  \u2022 Governance The TCFD recommends companies          \n  describe the board\u2019s oversight of, and              \n  management\u2019s role in, assessing and managing        \n  climate-related risks and opportunities.            \n  \u2022 Strategy The TCFD recommends companies describe   \n  identified climate-related risks and opportunities  \n  and the impact of these risks and opportunities on  \n  their businesses, strategy, and financial           \n  planning.                                           \n  \u2022 Risk Management The TCFD recommends companies     \n  describe processes for identifying, assessing, and  \n  managing climate-related risks and describe how     \n  these processes are integrated into overall risk    \n  management.                                         \n  \u2022 Metrics and Targets The TCFD recommends           \n  companies disclose metrics and targets used to      \n  assess and manage climate-related risks and         \n  opportunities.                                      \n  \u2014 State Street Global Advisors is not prescriptive  \n  on target setting. We expect companies that have    \n  adopted net zero ambitions to disclose interim      \n  climate targets.6 If a company chooses not to       \n  disclose any climate targets, we expect the         \n  company to provide an explanation on how the        \n  company measures and monitors progress on managing  \n  climate-related risks and opportunities in line     \n  with the recommendations of TCFD.                   \n  \u2014 TCFD recommends the disclosure of Scope 1, Scope  \n  2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 emissions. We       \n  expect companies to identify and disclose the most  \n  relevant categories of Scope 3 emissions as         \n  defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate    \n  Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting      \n  Standard. However, we recognize that Scope 3        \n  emissions estimates have a high degree of           \n  uncertainty; therefore, if the company determines   \n  that categories of Scope 3 are impracticable to     \n  estimate, we instead encourage companies to         \n  explain these limitations. We do not expect         \n  companies to set Scope 3 targets. We do encourage   \n  companies to explain any efforts to address Scope   \n  3 emissions in line with TCFD, such as engagement   \n  with suppliers, customers, or other stakeholders    \n  across the value chain, where relevant.             \n  6. \u201cNet zero ambitions\u201d are defined by State        \n  Street Global Advisors as a public                  \n  statement/commitment to align the company\u2019s         \n  emissions to third party frameworks or pathways     \n  for net zero.                                       \n                                                      \nC-16                                                                                                        \n      \n  17  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n                                         We may take voting action against directors serving at companies   \n                                         in the following indexes that fail to provide sufficient           \n                                         disclosure regarding: (i)\u00a0board oversight of climate-related       \n                                         risks and opportunities; (ii)\u00a0total direct and indirect GHG        \n                                         emissions (\u201cScope 1\u201d and \u201cScope 2\u201d emissions); (iii)               \n                                         climate-related targets, in accordance with the TCFD framework:    \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aS&P 500                                                         \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aS&P/TSX Composite                                               \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aFTSE 350                                                        \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aSTOXX 600                                                       \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aASX 200                                                         \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aTOPIX 100                                                       \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aHang Seng                                                       \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aStraits Times Index                                             \n                                         We may waive the guideline if a company engages with State Street  \n                                         Global Advisors and provides a specific, timebound plan for        \n                                         providing the expected disclosures.                                \n                                         Say-on-Climate Proposals While we are generally supportive of      \n                                         effective climate- related disclosure, we currently do not         \n                                         endorse an annual advisory climate vote. We have reservations      \n                                         with the potential unintended consequences of such a vote,         \n                                         including insulating directors from accountability, distracting    \n                                         from existing disclosure frameworks, and straining investors\u2019      \n                                         limited proxy voting resources.

The approval of capital       \n                                         raising activities is fundamental to a shareholder\u2019s               \n                                                                                                            \nC-17                                                                                                        \n      \n  18  \n      \n                                                      \n  ability to monitor the amounts of proceeds and to   \n  ensure capital is deployed efficiently. Altering    \n  the capital structure of a company is a critical    \n  decision for boards. When making such a decision,   \n  we believe the company should disclose a            \n  comprehensive business rationale that is            \n  consistent with corporate strategy and not overly   \n  dilutive to its shareholders.                       \n  Our approach to share capital structure matters     \n  may vary by local market and jurisdiction, due to   \n  regional nuances. Such proposals may include:       \n                                                      \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aIncrease in Authorized Common Shares             \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aIncrease in Authorized Preferred Shares          \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aUnequal Voting Rights                            \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aShare Repurchase Programs                        \n  Dividend Payouts We generally support dividend      \n  payouts that constitute 30 percent or more of net   \n  income. We may vote against a dividend payout if    \n  the dividend payout ratio has been consistently     \n  below 30 percent without adequate explanation. We   \n  may also vote against if the payout is excessive    \n  given the company\u2019s financial position. Particular  \n  attention will be warranted when the payment may    \n  damage the company\u2019s long-term financial health.    \n  Reorganization, Mergers and Acquisitions The        \n  reorganization of the structure of a company or     \n  mergers often involve proposals relating to         \n  reincorporation, restructurings, liquidations, and  \n  other major changes to the corporation.             \n  Proposals that are in the best interests of the     \n  shareholders, demonstrated by enhancing share       \n  value or improving the effectiveness of the         \n  company\u2019s operations, will generally be supported.  \n  We evaluate mergers and structural reorganizations  \n  on a case-by-case basis. We will generally support  \n  transactions that maximize shareholder value. Some  \n  of the considerations include the following:        \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aOffer premium                                    \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aStrategic rationale                              \n  \u2022 Board oversight of the process for the            \n  recommended transaction, including, director and/   \n  or management conflicts of interest                 \n  \u2022 Offers made at a premium and where there are no   \n  other higher bidders                                \n  \u2022 Offers in which the secondary market price is     \n  substantially lower than the net asset value        \n                                                      \nC-18                                                                                                        \n      \n  19  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n                        We may vote against a transaction considering the following:                        \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aOffers with potentially damaging consequences for minority shareholders because  \n                        of illiquid stock                                                                   \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aOffers where we believe there is a reasonable prospect for an enhanced bid or    \n                        other bidders                                                                       \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aThe current market price of the security exceeds the bid price at the time of    \n                        voting                                                                              \n                        Related-Party Transactions Some companies have a controlled ownership structure     \n                        and complex cross-shareholdings between subsidiaries and parent companies           \n                        (\u201crelated companies\u201d). Such structures may result in the prevalence of              \n                        related-party transactions between the company and its various stakeholders, such   \n                        as directors and management, subsidiaries and shareholders. In markets where        \n                        shareholders are required to approve such transactions, we expect companies to      \n                        disclose details of the transaction, such as the nature, the value and the purpose  \n                        of such a transaction. We also encourage independent directors to ratify such       \n                        transactions. Further, we encourage companies to describe the level of independent  \n                        board oversight and the approval process, including details of any independent      \n                        valuations provided by financial advisors on related-party transactions.            \n                        Cross-Shareholdings (Japan Only) \u201cCross-shareholdings\u201d are a long-standing feature  \n                        of the balance sheets of many Japanese companies, but, in our view, can be          \n                        detrimental for corporate governance practices and ultimately shareholder returns.  \n                        Therefore, State Street Global Advisors may vote against the board leader at the    \n                        TOPIX 500 companies where the \u201ccross-shareholdings\u201d (strategic listed shares) held  \n                        by a company exceed 30\u00a0percent of the company\u2019s net assets (as in the securities    \n                        report disclosed for the previous fiscal year).                                     \n                        We may waive the guideline if a company engages with State Street Global Advisors   \n                        and provides a specific, timebound, and publicly available plan for reducing its    \n                        exposure to \u201ccross-shareholdings\u201d:                                                  \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aTo less than 30% by 2025; or                                                     \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aBy 50% of current level by 2025                                                  \n                        Proxy Access (North America Only) In general, we believe that proxy access is a     \n                        fundamental right and an accountability mechanism for all long-term shareholders.   \n  Shareholder Rights    We consider proposals relating to proxy access on a case-by-case basis. We          \n                        generally support shareholder proposals that set parameters to empower long-term    \n                        shareholders while providing management the flexibility to design a process that    \n                        is appropriate for the company\u2019s circumstances.                                     \n                                                                                                            \nC-19                                                                                                        \n      \n  20  \n      \n                                                      \n  Vote Standards                                      \n  a. Annual Elections We generally support the        \n  establishment of annual elections of the board of   \n  directors. Consideration is given to the overall    \n  level of board independence and the independence    \n  of the key committees, as well as the existence of  \n  a shareholder rights plan.                          \n  b. Majority Voting We generally support a majority  \n  vote standard based on votes cast for the election  \n  of directors. We generally vote to support          \n  amendments to bylaws that would require simple      \n  majority of voting shares (i.e. shares cast) to     \n  pass or to repeal certain provisions.               \n  Shareholder Meetings                                \n  a. Special Meetings and Written Consent In          \n  general, we support the ability for shareholders    \n  to call special meetings, as well as act by         \n  written consent. We believe an appropriate          \n  threshold for both calling a special meeting and    \n  acting by written consent can be 25% of             \n  outstanding shares or less.                         \n  b. Notice Period to Convene a General Meeting We    \n  expect companies to give as much notice as is       \n  practicable when calling a general meeting.         \n  Generally, we are not supportive of authorizations  \n  seeking to reduce the notice period to less than    \n  14 days.                                            \n  c. Virtual/Hybrid Shareholder Meetings We           \n  generally support proposals that grant boards the   \n  right to hold shareholder meetings in a virtual or  \n  hybrid format as long as companies uphold the       \n  following best practices:                           \n  \u2022 Afford virtual attendee shareholders the same     \n  rights as would normally be granted to in-person    \n  attendee shareholders                               \n  \u2022 Commit to time-bound renewal (five years or       \n  less) of meeting format authorization by            \n  shareholders                                        \n  \u2022 Provide a written record of all questions posed   \n  during the meeting, and                             \n  \u2022 Comply with local market laws and regulations     \n  relating to virtual and hybrid shareholder meeting  \n  practices                                           \n  \u2022 If a company breaches any of the criteria above,  \n  we may vote against the chair of the nominating     \n  committee.                                          \n  \u2022 In evaluating these proposals we also consider    \n  the operating environment of the company,           \n  including local regulatory developments and         \n  specific market circumstances impacting virtual     \n  meeting practices.                                  \n                                                      \nC-20                                                                                                        \n      \n  21  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n  Governance Documents & Miscellaneous    Article Amendments                                                \n  Items                                                                                                     \n                                          a. Unilateral Amendments We may withhold votes from directors of  \n                                          companies that have unilaterally adopted/amended company bylaws   \n                                          that negatively impact shareholder rights (such as fee-shifting,  \n                                          forum selection, and exclusion service bylaws) without putting    \n                                          such amendments to a shareholder vote.                            \n                                          b. Super-Majority We generally vote against amendments to bylaws  \n                                          requiring super-majority shareholder votes to pass or repeal      \n                                          certain provisions. \u00a0 We generally vote for the reduction or      \n                                          elimination of super-majority vote requirements, unless           \n                                          management of the issuer was concurrently seeking to or had       \n                                          previously made such a reduction or elimination.                  \n                                          c. Board Size We generally support proposals seeking to fix the   \n                                          board size or designate a range for the board size and vote       \n                                          against proposals that give management the ability to alter the   \n                                          size of the board outside of a specified range without            \n                                          shareholder approval.                                             \n                                          Anti-Takeover Issues Occasionally, companies add anti-takeover    \n                                          provisions that reduce the chances of a potential acquirer to     \n                                          make an offer, or to reduce the likelihood of a successful        \n                                          offer. We generally do not support proposals that reduce          \n                                          shareholders\u2019 rights, entrench management, or reduce the          \n                                          likelihood of shareholders\u2019 right to vote on reasonable offers.   \n                                          Our approach to anti-takeover issues may vary by local market     \n                                          and jurisdiction, due to regional nuances. However, we will       \n                                          generally support mandates requiring shareholder approval of a    \n                                          shareholder rights plans (\u201cpoison pill\u201d) and repeals of various   \n                                          anti-takeover related provisions.                                 \n                                          When appropriate, we may vote for an amendment to a shareholder   \n                                          rights plan where the terms of the new plans are more favorable   \n                                          to shareholders\u2019 ability to accept unsolicited offers (i.e., if   \n                                          one of the following conditions are met: (i)\u00a0minimum trigger,     \n                                          flip-in or flip-over of 20\u00a0percent, (ii)\u00a0maximum term of three    \n                                          years, (iii)\u00a0no \u201cdead hand,\u201d \u201cslow hand,\u201d \u201cno hand\u201d nor similar   \n                                          feature that limits the ability of a future board to redeem the   \n                                          pill, and (iv)\u00a0inclusion of a shareholder redemption feature      \n                                          (qualifying offer clause), permitting ten percent of the shares   \n                                          to call a special meeting or seek a written consent to vote on    \n                                          rescinding the pill if the board refuses to redeem the pill 90    \n                                          days after a qualifying offer is announced).                      \n                                          Accounting and Audit-Related Issues Companies should have robust  \n                                          internal audit and internal control systems designed for          \n                                          effective management of any potential and emerging risks to       \n                                          company operations and strategy. The responsibility of setting    \n                                          out an internal audit function lies with the audit committee,     \n                                          which should have independent non-executive directors designated  \n                                          as members.                                                       \n                                          We believe the disclosure and availability of reliable financial  \n                                          statements in a timely manner is imperative for investment        \n                                          analysis. As a result, board oversight of the internal controls   \n                                          and the independence of the audit process are essential if        \n                                          investors are to rely upon financial statements.

When appointing external auditors and         \n                                       approving audit fees, we will take into consideration the level of   \n                                       detail in company disclosures.

Board of Directors\n\nVoting on Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections\n\nFour fundamental principles apply when determining votes on director nominees:\n\nIndependence:Boards should be sufficiently independent from management (and significant shareholders) to\nensure that they are able and motivated to effectively supervise management\u2019s performance for the benefit of\nall shareholders, including in setting and monitoring the execution of corporate strategy, with appropriate\nuse of shareholder capital, and in setting and monitoring executive compensation programs that support that\nstrategy. The chair of the board should ideally be an independent director, and all boards should have an\nindependent leadership position or a similar role in order to help provide appropriate counterbalance to\nexecutive management, as well as having sufficiently independent committees that focus on key governance\nconcerns such as audit, compensation, and nomination of directors.\n\nComposition:Companies should ensure that directors add value to the board through their specific skills and\nexpertise and by having sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. Boards should be of a size\nappropriate to accommodate diversity, expertise, and independence, while ensuring active and collaborative\nparticipation by all members. Boards should be sufficiently diverse to ensure consideration of a wide range\nof perspectives.\n\nResponsiveness:Directors should respond to investor input, such as that expressed through significant\nopposition to management proposals, significant support for shareholder proposals (whether binding or non-\nbinding),and tender offers where a majority of shares are tendered.\n\nAccountability:Boards should be sufficiently accountable to shareholders, including through transparency of\nthe company\u2019s governance practices and regular board elections, by the provision of sufficient information\nfor shareholders to be able to assess directors and board composition, and through the ability of\nshareholders to remove directors.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for director nominees, except under the following circumstances (with\nnew nominees 1 considered on case-by-casebasis):\n\nIndependence\n\nVote againstor withhold from non-independentdirectors (Executive Directors and Non-Independent Non-\nExecutiveDirectors perISS\u2019 Classification of Directors) when:\n                                                                         \n  \u25fe    Independent directors comprise 50\u00a0percent or less of the board;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                                                  \n  \u25fe    The non-independent director serves on the audit, compensation, or nominating committee;  \n                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so that the full board functions  \n        as that committee; or                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    The company lacks a formal nominating committee, even if the board attests that the independent     \n        directors fulfill the functions of such a committee.                                                \n                                                                                                            \n1 A \u201cnew nominee\u201d is a director who is being presented for election by shareholders for the first time.\nRecommendations on new nominees who have served for less than one year are made on a case-by-case basis\ndepending on the timing of their appointment and the problematic governance issue in question.\n\n2 In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use \u201cWithhold\u201d as the contrary vote option in\ndirector elections; companies with a majority vote standard use \u201cAgainst\u201d. However, it will vary by company\nand the proxy must be checked to determine the valid contrary vote option for the particular company.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Current interim officers are included in this category. For private companies, the equivalent\npositions are applicable. A non-employee director serving as an officer due to statutory requirements (e.g.\ncorporate secretary) will generally be classified as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director under \u201cAny\nmaterial relationship with the company.\u201d However, if the company provides explicit disclosure that the\ndirector is not receiving additional compensation exceeding $10,000 per year for serving in that capacity,\nthen the director will be classified as an Independent Director.\n\n2. \u201cAffiliate\u201d includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. ISS uses 50 percent control\nownership by the parent company as the standard for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor\nof an externally managed issuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate.\n\n3. Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the company\u2019s initial public offering (IPO).\n\n4. When there is a former CEO of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) serving on the board of an\nacquired company, ISS will generally classify such directors as independent unless determined otherwise\ntaking into account the following factors: the applicable listing standards determination of such director\u2019s\nindependence; any operating ties to the firm; and the existence of any other conflicting relationships or\nrelated party transactions.\n\n5.ISS will look at the terms of the interim officer\u2019s employment contract to determine if it contains\nseverance pay, long-term health and pension benefits, or other such standard provisions typically contained\nin contracts of permanent, non-temporary CEOs. ISS will also consider if a formal search process was under\nway for a full-time officer at the time.\n\n6.\u201cImmediate family member\u201d follows the SEC\u2019s definition of such and covers spouses, parents, children,\nstep-parents, step-children, siblings, in-laws, and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the\nhousehold of any director, nominee for director, executive officer, or significant shareholder of the\ncompany.\n\n7. Professional services can be characterized as advisory in nature, generally involve access to sensitive\ncompany information or to strategic decision-making, and typically have a commission- or fee-based payment\nstructure. Professional services generally include but are not limited to the following: investment\nbanking/financial advisory services, commercial banking (beyond deposit services), investment services,\ninsurance services, accounting/audit services, consulting services, marketing services, legal services,\nproperty management services, realtor services, lobbying services, executive search services, and IT\nconsulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional relationships and not\nprofessional services: deposit services, IT tech support services, educational services, and construction\nservices. The case of participation in a banking syndicate by a non-lead bank should be considered a\ntransactional (and hence subject to the associated materiality test) rather than a professional\nrelationship. \u201cOf Counsel\u201d relationships are only considered immaterial if the individual does not receive\nany form of compensation (in excess of $10,000 per year) from, or is a retired partner of, the firm\nproviding the professional service. The case of a company providing a professional service to one of its\ndirectors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated, will be considered a transactional\nrather than a professional relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be\nprofessional services unless the company explains why such services are not advisory.\n\n8. A material transactional relationship, including grants to non-profit organizations, exists if the\ncompany makes annual payments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity, exceeding the greater\nof: $200,000 or 5 percent of the recipient\u2019s gross revenues, for a company that follows NASDAQ listing\nstandards; or the greater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient\u2019s gross revenues, for a company that\nfollows NYSE listing standards. For a company that follows neither of the preceding standards, ISS will\napply the NASDAQ-based materiality test. (The recipient is the party receiving the financial proceeds from\nthe transaction).\n\n9. Dissident directors who are parties to a voting agreement pursuant to a settlement or similar arrangement\nmay be classified as Independent Directors if an analysis of the following factors indicates that the voting\nagreement does not compromise their alignment with all shareholders\u2019 interests: the terms of the agreement;\nthe duration of the standstill provision in the agreement; the limitations and requirements of actions that\nare agreed upon; if the dissident director nominee(s) is subject to the standstill; and if there any\nconflicting relationships or related party transactions.\n\n10.Interlocks include: executive officers serving as directors on each other\u2019s compensation or similar\ncommittees (or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board); or executive officers sitting on each\nother\u2019s boards and at least one serves on the other\u2019s compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence\nof such a committee, on the board).\n\n11.

An exception\nwill be made if there was at least one woman on the board at the preceding annual meeting and the board\nmakes a firm commitment to return to a gender-diverse status within a year.\n\nRacial and/or Ethnic Diversity:For companies in the Russell 3000 or S&P 1500 indices, generally vote against\nor withhold from the chair of the nominating committee (or other directors on a case-by-casebasis) where the\nboard has no apparent racially or ethnically diverse members 5. An exception will be made if there was\nracial and/or ethnic diversity on the board at the preceding annual meeting and the board makes a firm\ncommitment to appoint at least one racial and/or ethnic diverse member within a year.\n\n3 Nominees who served for only part of the fiscal year are generally exempted from the attendance policy.\n\n4 Although all of a CEO\u2019s subsidiary boards with publicly-traded common stock will be counted as separate\nboards, ISS will not recommend a withhold vote for the CEO of a parent company board or any of the\ncontrolled (>50 percent ownership) subsidiaries of that parent but may do so at subsidiaries that are less\nthan 50 percent controlled and boards outside the parent/subsidiary relationships.\n\n5 Aggregate diversity statistics provided by the board will only be considered if specific to racial and/or\nethnic diversity.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Shareholder Rights & Defenses\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals/Nominations\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon advance notice proposals, giving support to those proposals which\nallow shareholders to submit proposals/nominations as close to the meeting date as reasonably possible and\nwithin the broadest window possible, recognizing the need to allow sufficient notice for company,\nregulatory, and shareholder review.\n\nTo be reasonable, the company\u2019s deadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/nominations must be no earlier\nthan 120 days prior to the anniversary of the previous year\u2019s meeting and have a submittal window of no\nshorter than 30 days from the beginning of the notice period (also known as a 90-120-day window). The\nsubmittal window is the period under which shareholders must file their proposals/nominations prior to the\ndeadline.\n\nIn general, support additional efforts by companies to ensure full disclosure in regard to a proponent\u2019s\neconomic and voting position in the company so long as the informational requirements are reasonable and\naimed at providing shareholders with the necessary information to review such proposals.\n\nAmend Bylaws without Shareholder Consent\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote against proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws.\n\nVote case-by-case on proposals giving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition to shareholders,\ntaking into account the following:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Any impediments to shareholders\u2019 ability to amend the bylaws (i.e. supermajority voting             \n        requirements);                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                          \n  \u25fe    The company\u2019s ownership structure and historical voting turnout;  \n                                                                          \n                                                                           \n  \u25fe    Whether the board could amend bylaws adopted by shareholders; and  \n                                                                           \n                                                                                                 \n  \u25fe    Whether shareholders would retain the ability to ratify any board-initiated amendments.  \n                                                                                                 \nControl Share Acquisition Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing so\nwould enable the completion of a takeover that would be detrimental to shareholders.\n\nVote against proposals to amend the charter to include control share acquisition provisions.\n\nVote for proposals to restore voting rights to the control shares.\n\nControl share acquisition statutes function by denying shares their voting rights when they contribute to\nownership in excess of certain thresholds. Voting rights for those shares exceeding ownership limits may\nonly be restored by approval of either a majority or supermajority of disinterested shares. Thus, control\nshare acquisition statutes effectively require a hostile bidder to put its offer to a shareholder vote or\nrisk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder continues buying up a large block of shares.\n\nControl Share Cash-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share cash-outstatutes.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

In other words, when an investor\ncrosses a preset threshold level, remaining shareholders are given the right to sell their shares to the\nacquirer, who must buy them at the highest acquiring price.\n\nDisgorgement Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state disgorgement provisions.\n\nDisgorgement provisions require an acquirer or potential acquirer of more than a certain percentage of a\ncompany\u2019s stock to disgorge, or pay back, to the company any profits realized from the sale of that\ncompany\u2019s stock purchased 24 months before achieving control status. All sales of company stock by the\nacquirer occurring within a certain period of time (between 18 months and 24 months) prior to the investor\u2019s\ngaining control status are subject to these recapture-of-profits provisions.\n\nFair Price Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon proposals to adopt fair price provisions (provisions that\nstipulate that an acquirer must pay the same price to acquire all shares as it paid to acquire the control\nshares), evaluating factors such as the vote required to approve the proposed acquisition, the vote required\nto repeal the fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair price.\n\nGenerally vote against fair price provisions with shareholder vote requirements greater than a majority of\ndisinterested shares.\n\nFreeze-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state freeze-outprovisions. Freeze-outprovisions\nforce an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a company to wait a specified period of\ntime before gaining control of the company.\n\nGreenmail\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments or otherwise\nrestrict a company\u2019s ability to make greenmail payments.\n\nVote case-by-case on anti-greenmail proposals when they are bundled with other charter or bylaw amendments.\n\nGreenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock from individuals or groups\nseeking control of the company. Since only the hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial\npremium over the market value of its shares, the practice discriminates against all other shareholders.\n\nShareholder Litigation Rights\n\nFederal Forum Selection Provisions\n\nFederal forum selection provisions require that U.S. federal courts be the sole forum for shareholders to\nlitigate claims arising under federal securities law.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

The comprehensiveness  \n        of the sales process (e.g., full auction, partial auction, no auction) can also affect shareholder  \n        value.                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Conflicts of interest - Are insiders benefiting from the transaction disproportionately and         \n        inappropriately as compared to non-insider shareholders? As the result of potential conflicts, the  \n        directors and officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a merger than if they   \n  \u25fe    did not hold these interests. Consider whether these interests may have influenced these directors  \n        and officers to support or recommend the merger. The CIC figure presented in the \u201cISS Transaction   \n        Summary\u201d section of this report is an aggregate figure that can in certain cases be a misleading    \n        indicator of the true value transfer from shareholders to insiders. Where such figure appears to    \n        be excessive, analyze the underlying assumptions to determine whether a potential conflict exists.  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

Additionally, a private company discount may be applied to the        \n        target if it is a private entity.                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Market reaction - How has the market responded to the proposed deal? A negative market reaction     \n  \u25fe    may be a cause for concern. Market reaction may be addressed by analyzing the one-day impact on     \n        the unaffected stock price.                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Deal timing - A main driver for most transactions is that the SPAC charter typically requires the   \n  \u25fe    deal to be complete within 18 to 24 months, or the SPAC is to be liquidated. Evaluate the           \n        valuation, market reaction, and potential conflicts of interest for deals that are announced close  \n        to the liquidation date.                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Negotiations and process - What was the process undertaken to identify potential target companies   \n  \u25fe    within specified industry or location specified in charter? Consider the background of the          \n        sponsors.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Conflicts of interest - How are sponsors benefiting from the transaction compared to IPO            \n        shareholders? Potential conflicts could arise if a fairness opinion is issued by the insiders to    \n        qualify the deal rather than a third party or if management is encouraged to pay a higher price     \n  \u25fe    for the target because of an 80\u00a0percent rule (the charter requires that the fair market value of    \n        the target is at least equal to 80\u00a0percent of net assets of the SPAC). Also, there may be sense of  \n        urgency by the management team of the SPAC to close the deal since its charter typically requires   \n        a transaction to be completed within the 18-24-month timeframe.                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Voting agreements - Are the sponsors entering into enter into any voting agreements/tender offers   \n  \u25fe    with shareholders who are likely to vote against the proposed merger or exercise conversion         \n        rights?                                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Governance - What is the impact of having the SPAC CEO or founder on key committees following the   \n        proposed merger?                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

Other times,    \n        the SPAC has entered into a definitive transaction agreement, but needs additional time to          \n        consummate or hold the shareholder meeting.                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Added incentive for non-redeeming shareholders: Sometimes the SPAC sponsor (or other insiders)      \n        will contribute, typically as a loan to the company, additional funds that will be added to the     \n  \u25fe    redemption value of each public share as long as such shares are not redeemed in connection with    \n        the extension request.

SVT is expressed as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of market value, and\nincludes the new shares proposed, shares available under existing plans, and shares granted but unexercised\n(using two measures, in the case of plans subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, as noted above).\nAll award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are placed on the most expensive types of\nawards (for example, full-value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be granted will be the\nmost expensive types.\n\nFor proposals that are not subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value Transfer is\nreasonable if it falls below a company-specific benchmark. The benchmark is determined as follows: The top\nquartile performers in each industry group (using the Global Industry Classification Standard: GICS) are\nidentified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are established based on these top performers\u2019 historic\nSVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most strongly correlated\nto SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the specific company by\nplugging the company-specific performance measures, size, and cash compensation into the industry cap\nequations to arrive at the company\u2019s benchmark.22\n\nThree-Year Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\n\nA \u201cValue-Adjusted Burn Rate\u201d is used for stock plan evaluations. Value-Adjusted Burn Rate benchmarks are\ncalculated as the greater of: (1) an industry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the\ncompany\u2019s GICS group segmented by S&P 500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&P 500) and non-Russell 3000 index;\nand (2) a de minimisthreshold established separately for each of the S&P 500, the Russell 3000 index less\nthe S&P 500, and the non-Russell 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-rate benchmark changes will be limited to a\npredetermined range above or below the prior year\u2019s burn-rate benchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate is calculated as follows:\n\nValue-Adjusted Burn Rate = ((# of options * option\u2019s dollar value using a Black-Scholes model) + (# of full-\nvalue awards * stock price)) / (Weighted average common shares * stock price).\n\nEgregious Factors\n\nLiberal Change in Control Definition\n\nGenerally vote against equity plans if the plan has a liberal definition of change in control and the equity\nawards could vest upon such liberal definition of change in control, even though an actual change in control\nmay not occur. Examples of such a definition include, but are not limited to, announcement or commencement\nof a tender offer, provisions for acceleration upon a \u201cpotential\u201d takeover, shareholder approval of a merger\nor other transactions, or similar language.\n\n22 For plans evaluated under the Equity Plan Scorecard policy, the company\u2019s SVT benchmark is considered\nalong with other factors.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

The proposal should clearly articulate why the board is choosing to conduct an exchange program at\nthis point in time. Repricing underwater options after a recent precipitous drop in the company\u2019s stock\nprice demonstrates poor timing and warrants additional scrutiny. Also, consider the terms of the surrendered\noptions, such as the grant date, exercise price and vesting schedule. Grant dates of surrendered options\nshould be far enough back (two to three years) so as not to suggest that repricings are being done to take\nadvantage of short-term downward price movements. Similarly, the exercise price of surrendered options\nshould be above the 52-week high for the stock price.\n\nVote for shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.\n\nStock Plans in Lieu of Cash\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon plans that provide participants with the option of taking all or\na portion of their cash compensation in the form of stock.\n\nVote for non-employee director-only equity plans that provide a dollar-for-dollar cash-for-stock exchange.\n\nVote case-by-case on plans which do not provide a dollar-for-dollar cash for stock exchange.

In an effort to capture the total cost of total\ncompensation, ISS will not make any adjustments to carve out the in-lieu-of cash compensation.\n\nTransfer Stock Option (TSO) Programs\n\nGeneral Recommendation:One-timeTransfers: Vote against or withhold from compensation committee members if\nthey fail to submit one-timetransfers to shareholders for approval.\n\nVote case-by-case on one-time transfers.

Standard stock options    \n        and performance-accelerated awards do not meet the criteria to be considered as performance-based   \n        awards. Further, premium-priced options should have a meaningful premium to be considered           \n        performance-based awards.                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Second, assess the rigor of the company\u2019s performance-based equity program. If the bar set for the  \n        performance-based program is too low based on the company\u2019s historical or peer group comparison,    \n  \u25fe    generally vote for the proposal. Furthermore, if target performance results in an above target      \n        payout, vote for the shareholder proposal due to program\u2019s poor design. If the company does not     \n        disclose the performance metric of the performance-based equity program, vote for the shareholder   \n        proposal regardless of the outcome of the first step to the test.                                   \n                                                                                                            \nIn general, vote for the shareholder proposal if the company does not meet both of the above two steps.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Many companies have adopted policies that permit recoupment in cases where\nan executive\u2019s fraud, misconduct, or negligence significantly contributed to a restatement of financial\nresults that led to the awarding of unearned incentive compensation. However, such policies may be narrow\ngiven that not all misconduct or negligence may result in significant financial restatements.

Social and Environmental Issues\n\nGlobal Approach \u2013 E&S Shareholder Proposals\n\nISS applies a common approach globally to evaluating social and environmental proposals which cover a wide\nrange of topics, including consumer and product safety, environment and energy, labor standards and human\nrights, workplace and board diversity, and corporate political issues. While a variety of factors goes into\neach analysis, the overall principle guiding all vote recommendations focuses on how the proposal may\nenhance or protect shareholder value in either the short or long term.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote case-by-case,examining primarily whether implementation of the\nproposal is likely to enhance or protect shareholder value. The following factors will be considered:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    If the issues presented in the proposal are being appropriately or effectively dealt with through   \n        legislation or government regulation;                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    If the company has already responded in an appropriate and sufficient manner to the issue(s)        \n        raised in the proposal;                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                          \n  \u25fe    Whether the proposal\u2019s request is unduly burdensome (scope or timeframe) or overly prescriptive;  \n                                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    The company\u2019s approach compared with any industry standard practices for addressing the issue(s)    \n        raised by the proposal;                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Whether there are significant controversies, fines, penalties, or litigation associated with the    \n        company\u2019s practices related to the issue(s) raised in the proposal;                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        If the proposal requests increased disclosure or greater transparency, whether reasonable and       \n  \u25fe    sufficient information is currently available to shareholders from the company or from other        \n        publicly available sources; and                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        If the proposal requests increased disclosure or greater transparency, whether implementation       \n  \u25fe    would reveal proprietary or confidential information that could place the company at a competitive  \n        disadvantage.                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nEndorsement of Principles\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote against proposals seeking a company\u2019s endorsement of principles that\nsupport a particular public policy position. Endorsing a set of principles may require a company to take a\nstand on an issue that is beyond its own control and may limit its flexibility with respect to future\ndevelopments.\n\nManagement and the board should be afforded the flexibility to make decisions on specific public policy\npositions based on their own assessment of the most beneficial strategies for the company.\n\nAnimal Welfare\n\nAnimal Welfare Policies\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for proposals seeking a report on a company\u2019s animal welfare\nstandards, or animal welfare-related risks, unless:\n                                                                                                      \n  \u25fe    The company has already published a set of animal welfare standards and monitors compliance;  \n                                                                                                      \n                                                                       \n  \u25fe    The company\u2019s standards are comparable to industry peers; and  \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    There are no recent significant fines, litigation, or controversies related to the company\u2019s        \n        and/or its suppliers\u2019 treatment of animals.                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

Persons Controlled By or Under Common Control With Registrant The Board of Trustees of the Trust is\nthe same as the Boards of Trustees of SPDR Index Shares Funds and SSGA Active Trust. In addition, the\nofficers of the Trust are substantially identical to the officers of SPDR Index Shares Funds and SSGA Active\nTrust. Additionally, the Trust\u2019s investment adviser, SSGA FM, also serves as investment adviser to each\nseries of SPDR Index Shares Funds and SSGA Active Trust. Nonetheless, the Trust takes the position that it\nis not under common control with other trusts because the power residing in the respective boards and\nofficers arises as the result of an official position with the respective trusts. Additionally, see the\n\u201cControl Persons and Principal Holders of Securities\u201d section of the Statement of Additional Information for\na list of shareholders who own more than 5% of a specific fund\u2019s outstanding shares and such information is\nincorporated by reference to this Item. Item 30. Indemnification Pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Registrant\u2019s\nAmended and Restated Declaration of Trust and under Section 4.9 of the Registrant\u2019s By-Laws, the Trust will\nindemnify any person who is, or has been, a Trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Trust against all\nexpenses reasonably incurred or paid by him/her in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding in\nwhich he/she becomes involved as a party or otherwise by virtue of his/her being or having been a Trustee,\nofficer, employee or agent and against amounts paid or incurred by him/her in the settlement thereof, if\nhe/she acted in good faith and in a manner he/she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best\ninterests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to\nbelieve his/her conduct was unlawful. In addition, indemnification is permitted only if it is determined\nthat the actions in question did not render him/her liable by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence in the performance of his/her duties or by reason of reckless disregard of his/her\nobligations and duties to the Registrant. The Registrant may also advance money for litigation expenses\nprovided that Trustees, officers, employees and/or agents give their undertakings to repay the Registrant\nunless their conduct is later determined to permit indemnification.\n\nPursuant to Section 5.2 of the Registrant\u2019s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, no Trustee, officer,\nemployee or agent of the Registrant shall be liable for any action or failure to act, except in the case of\nwillful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence or reckless disregard of duties to the Registrant.\nPursuant to paragraph 9 of the Registrant\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser shall not be liable\nfor any action or failure to act, except in the case of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence\nor reckless disregard of duties to the Registrant. Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under\nthe Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cAct\u201d) may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of\nthe Registrant pursuant to the provisions of Rule 484 under the Act, or otherwise, the Registrant has been\nadvised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act\nand is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities\n(other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling\nperson of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such\ndirector, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant\nwill, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a\ncourt of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy\nas expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The Registrant hereby\nundertakes that it will apply the indemnification provision of its By-Laws in a manner consistent with\nRelease 11330 of the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), so long as\nthe interpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i) thereunder remains in effect. The Registrant maintains\ninsurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Registrant, or\nwho is or was serving at the request of the Registrant as a trustee, director, officer, employee or agent of\nanother trust or corporation, against any liability asserted against him/her and incurred by him/her or\narising out of his/her position. However, in no event will the Registrant maintain insurance to indemnify\nany such person for any act for which the Registrant itself is not permitted to indemnify him/her.
