You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.XX%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses1                      0.XX%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.XX%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \n1 \u201c Other expenses \u201d are based on estimated\namounts for the current fiscal year. Example:\nThis Example is intended to help you compare\nthe cost of investing in the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated, and then sell\nor hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                  \n  Year 1  Year 3  \n  $[      $[      \n  ]       ]       \n                  \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over \u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. The Fund had not commenced\noperations as of the date of this Prospectus\nand, as a result, does not yet have a\nportfolio turnover rate. The Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In seeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P Sector-Neutral High\nYield Dividend Aristocrats Index (the \u201c Index\n\u201d ), the Fund employs a sampling strategy,\nwhich means that the Fund is not required to\npurchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nBased on its analysis of these factors, SSGA\nFunds Management, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c\nAdviser \u201d ), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a\nsubset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not\nincluded in the Index, cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments, such\nas repurchase\n\n1\n\nagreements and money market funds (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries, but only to the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries. Futures contracts (a type\nof derivative instrument) may be used by the\nFund in seeking performance that corresponds\nto the Index and in managing cash flows. The\nIndex is designed to measure the performance\nof companies in the S&P Composite 1500 \u00ae Index\n(the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ) that have followed a\npolicy of increasing or maintaining dividends\nevery year for at least seven consecutive\nyears while maintaining sector weights that\ncorrespond to the Parent Index. The Parent\nIndex is designed to measure the performance\nof the large-, mid-, and small-capitalization\nsegments of the U.S. equity market. To be\neligible for inclusion in the Index, stocks\nmust also meet minimum float-adjusted market\ncapitalization and liquidity requirements.\nAfter determining the eligible companies, the\nIndex Provider (defined below) calculates the\nmedian annual dividend yield of the eligible\ncompanies within each Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS) sector to\nobtain a sector median dividend yield.\nEligible companies with dividend yields above\ntheir corresponding sector median dividend\nyield will be selected for inclusion in the\nIndex. At each rebalance, companies within the\nIndex are weighted by float-adjusted market\ncapitalization within their corresponding\nsector. Each sector is then weighted to mirror\nthe corresponding sector weight within the\nParent Index. The Index is reconstituted\nannually after the closing of the last\nbusiness day of January and rebalanced\nquarterly after the closing of the last\nbusiness day of January, April, July and\nOctober. If between annual reviews the Index\nProvider determines, based on publicly\navailable information, that an Index\nconstituent has omitted a scheduled dividend\npayment, announced it will cease paying\ndividends for an undetermined period, or\nannounced a reduced dividend amount and will\nno longer qualify for the Index at the\nsubsequent reconstitution, the Index\nconstituent will be removed from the Index\neffective prior to the open of the first\nbusiness day of the following month. As of [\n], 2023, a significant portion of the Index\ncomprised companies in the [technology\nsector], although this may change from time to\ntime. As of [ ], 2023, the Index comprised [ ]\nstocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d ),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings\nof the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the\nFund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund\nShares will change in value, and you could\nlose money by investing in the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\ninflation, changes in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the\nspread of infectious illness or other public\nhealth issues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market\nprices of equity securities owned by the Fund\nmay go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The value of a security may\ndecline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may\ndecline due to general industry or market\nconditions that are not specifically related\nto a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to fall over short or\nextended periods of time. Dividend Paying\nSecurities Risk: Securities that pay\ndividends, as a group, can fall out of favor\nwith the market, causing such companies to\nunderperform companies that do not pay\ndividends. In addition, changes in the\ndividend policies of the companies held by the\nFund or the capital resources available for\nsuch company's dividend payments may adversely\naffect the Fund. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares\nmay be bought and sold in the secondary market\nat market prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines.\n\n2\n\nFutures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a\nstandardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract.\nTransactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much\ngreater loss than the principal amount\ninvested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out the futures contract at a favorable\ntime or price. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract. In\nthe event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions,\nand the Fund will be unable to terminate its\nexposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between\nmovements in the prices of the futures\ncontract and movements in the price of the\nunderlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to\nmake timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its\nobligations. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy.\nThe structure and composition of the Index\nwill affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to\ntime and may not be identified and corrected\nby the Index Provider for a period of time or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. To the extent\ncircumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and\nthe Fund may therefore hold for a period of\ntime, securities of companies that do not\nalign with the Index's objective and/or\ncriteria. When there are changes made to the\ncomponent securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its\nportfolio, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes\nwill be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as\na result of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to distribute any such\ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse\nfederal income tax consequences. While the\nAdviser seeks to track the performance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The\nFund incurs a number of operating expenses not\napplicable to the Index, and incurs costs in\nbuying and selling securities. In addition,\nthe Fund may not be fully invested at times,\ngenerally as a result of cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or reserves of cash held by\nthe Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing\nin fewer than all of the securities in the\nIndex, or in some securities not included in\nthe Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that\nof the Index. New Fund Risk: The Fund is new\nand there is no assurance that the Fund will\ngrow quickly. When the Fund's size is small,\nthe Fund may experience low trading volume,\nwhich could lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In\naddition, the Fund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if the Fund does not meet certain\nconditions of the listing exchange. Any\nresulting liquidation of the Fund could cause\nelevated transaction costs for the Fund and\nnegative tax consequences for its\nshareholders. Non-Diversification Risk: As a \u201c\nnon-diversified \u201d fund, the Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively small number of\nissuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may\naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund\nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome diversified for periods of time solely\nas a result of tracking the Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Technology Sector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors impacting technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major\neffect on the value of the Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of technology companies\nand companies that rely heavily on technology\nis particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and\ninternationally, including competition from\nforeign competitors with lower production\ncosts. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,\nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual\nproperty rights, the loss or impairment of\nwhich may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology\nsector may face dramatic and often\nunpredictable changes in growth rates and\ncompetition for the services of qualified\npersonnel.\n\n3\n\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest\na substantial portion of its assets within one\nor more economic sectors or industries, which\nmay change from time to time. Greater\ninvestment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for\nvolatility and the risk that events negatively\naffecting such sectors or industries could\nreduce returns, potentially causing the value\nof the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Fund Performance The Fund had\nnot commenced operations as of the date of\nthis Prospectus. Once the Fund has completed a\nfull calendar year of operations, a bar chart\nand table will be included that will provide\nsome indication of the risks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing the variability of the\nFund's returns based on net assets and\ncomparing the Fund's performance to the Index.\nWhen available, updated performance\ninformation may be obtained by calling\n1-866-787-2257 or visiting the Fund's website:\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Portfolio\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves\nas the investment adviser to the Fund.\nPortfolio Managers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are Emiliano Rabinovich, Juan Acevedo\nand Ted Janowsky. Emiliano Rabinovich, CFA, is\na Managing Director of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity\nBeta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2006. Juan Acevedo is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions Group. He joined\nthe Adviser in 2000. Ted Janowsky, CFA, is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2005. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201c Creation\nUnits. \u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc. (the \u201c Exchange \u201d ), other national\nsecurities exchanges, electronic crossing\nnetworks and other alternative trading systems\nthrough your broker-dealer at market prices.\nBecause Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\nFund Shares may trade at a price greater than\nNAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).\nWhen buying or selling Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from a tax-advantaged arrangement may be\ntaxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase\nFund Shares through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), the\nAdviser or its affiliates may pay the\nfinancial intermediary for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund, including educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n4\n\nAdditional Strategies Information Principal\nStrategies General . Please see \u201c The Fund's\nPrincipal Investment Strategy \u201d section under\n\u201c Fund Summary \u201d above for a discussion of the\nFund's principal investment strategy. The Fund\nmay invest in various types of securities and\nengage in various investment techniques which\nare not the principal focus of the Fund and\ntherefore are not described in this\nProspectus. These securities, techniques and\npractices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional\nInformation (the \u201c SAI \u201d ), which you may\nobtain free of charge by contacting\nshareholder services (see the back cover of\nthis Prospectus for the address and phone\nnumber). The Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Fund's Index as closely as\npossible (i.e ., obtain a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index). A number of\nfactors may affect the Fund's ability to\nachieve a high degree of correlation with its\nIndex, and there can be no guarantee that the\nFund will achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation. For example, the Fund may not be\nable to achieve a high degree of correlation\nwith its Index when there are practical\ndifficulties or substantial costs involved in\ncompiling a portfolio of securities to follow\nthe Index, when a security in the Index\nbecomes temporarily illiquid, unavailable or\nless liquid, or legal restrictions exist that\nprohibit the Fund from investing in a security\nin the Index. The Adviser will utilize a\nsampling strategy in managing the Fund.\nSampling means that the Adviser uses\nquantitative analysis to select securities,\nincluding securities in the Index, outside of\nthe Index and derivatives that have a similar\ninvestment profile as the Index in terms of\nkey risk factors, performance attributes and\nother economic characteristics. These include\nindustry weightings, market capitalization,\nand other financial characteristics of\nsecurities. The quantity of holdings in the\nFund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. In addition,\nfrom time to time, securities are added to or\nremoved from the Index. The Adviser may sell\nsecurities that are represented in the Index,\nor purchase securities that are not yet\nrepresented in the Index, in anticipation of\ntheir removal from or addition to the Index.\nFurther, the Adviser may choose to overweight\nsecurities in the Index, purchase or sell\nsecurities not in the Index, or utilize\nvarious combinations of other available\ntechniques, in seeking to track the Index. The\nFund, as described in the SAI, has adopted a\nnon-fundamental investment policy to invest at\nleast 80% of its net assets, plus the amount\nof borrowings for investment purposes, in\ninvestments suggested by its name, measured at\nthe time of investment. The Fund will provide\nshareholders with at least 60 days' notice\nprior to any change in this non-fundamental\n80% investment policy. The Board of Trustees\nof the Trust (the \u201c Board \u201d ) may change the\nFund's investment strategy, Index and other\npolicies without shareholder approval, except\nas otherwise indicated in this Prospectus or\nin the SAI. The Board may also change the\nFund's investment objective without\nshareholder approval. Non-Principal Strategies\nCertain Other Investments . The Fund may\ninvest in structured notes (notes on which the\namount of principal repayment and interest\npayments are based on the movement of one or\nmore specified factors such as the movement of\na particular security or index), swaps and\noptions. Swaps, options and structured notes\nmay be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to its Index and in managing\ncash flows. Temporary Defensive Positions . In\ncertain situations or market conditions, the\nFund may temporarily depart from its normal\ninvestment policies and strategies, provided\nthat the alternative is consistent with the\nFund's investment objective and is in the best\ninterest of the Fund. For example, the Fund\nmay make larger than normal investments in\nderivatives to maintain exposure to its Index\nif it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . The Fund\nmay borrow money from a bank as permitted by\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n( \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ), or other governing statute,\nby the rules thereunder, or by the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission ( \u201c SEC \u201d )\nor other regulatory agency with authority over\nthe Fund, but only for temporary or emergency\npurposes. The 1940 Act presently allows the\nFund to borrow from any bank (including\npledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets)\nin an amount up to 33 1 / 3 % of its total\nassets (not including temporary borrowings not\nin excess of 5% of its total assets). The Fund\nmay also invest in reverse repurchase\nagreements or similar financing transactions.\nConsistent with a rule under the 1940 Act, the\nFund may treat such investments as either\nborrowings or derivatives transactions. To the\nextent the Fund treats reverse repurchase\nagreements or similar financing transactions\nas borrowings, such investments will also be\nincluded in the 33 1/3% limit. Under normal\ncircumstances, any borrowings by the Fund\n(including investments in reverse repurchase\nagreements or similar financing transactions\ntreated as borrowings) will not exceed 10% of\nthe Fund's total assets.\n\n5\n\nLending of Securities . The Fund may lend its\nportfolio securities in an amount not to\nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets via\na securities lending program through its\nsecurities lending agent, State Street Bank\nand Trust Company ( \u201c State Street \u201d or the \u201c\nLending Agent \u201d ), to brokers, dealers and\nother financial institutions desiring to\nborrow securities to complete transactions and\nfor other purposes. A securities lending\nprogram allows the Fund to receive a portion\nof the income generated by lending its\nsecurities and investing the respective\ncollateral. The Fund will receive collateral\nfor each loaned security which is at least\nequal to the market value of that security,\nmarked to market each trading day. To the\nextent the Fund receives cash collateral, as\nof the date of this Prospectus, the Adviser\nexpects to invest such cash collateral in a\nfund managed by the Adviser that invests in: a\nbroad range of money market instruments;\ncertificates of deposit and time deposits of\nU.S. and foreign banks; commercial paper and\nother high quality obligations of U.S. or\nforeign companies; asset-backed securities;\nmortgage-related securities; repurchase\nagreements; and shares of money market funds.\nIn the securities lending program, the\nborrower generally has the right to vote the\nloaned securities; however, the Fund may call\nloans to vote proxies if a material issue\naffecting the Fund's economic interest in the\ninvestment is to be voted upon. Security loans\nmay be terminated at any time by the Fund.\nAdditional Risk Information The following\nsection provides information regarding the\nprincipal risks identified under \u201c Principal\nRisks of Investing in the Fund \u201d in the Fund\nSummary along with additional risk\ninformation. Principal Risks Counterparty Risk\n. The Fund will be subject to credit risk with\nrespect to the counterparties with which the\nFund enters into derivatives contracts and\nother transactions such as repurchase\nagreements or reverse repurchase agreements.\nThe Fund's ability to profit from these types\nof investments and transactions will depend on\nthe willingness and ability of its\ncounterparty to perform its obligations. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund may be unable to\nterminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss\nto the Fund. The Fund may experience\nsignificant delays in obtaining any recovery\nin an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other\nreorganization proceeding involving its\ncounterparty (including recovery of any\ncollateral posted by it) and may obtain only a\nlimited recovery or may obtain no recovery in\nsuch circumstances. If the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by its counterparty, it may\nbe delayed or prevented from realizing on the\ncollateral in the event of a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if the Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with\na financial institution and such financial\ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial\ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from\nexercising its rights to terminate the\ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on\nany collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or\ntransactions or in another institution being\nsubstituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, the\nFund may be subject to \u201c bail-in \u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the\nfinancial institution's authority, the\nfinancial institution's liabilities could be\nwritten down, eliminated or converted into\nequity or an alternative instrument of\nownership. A bail-in of a financial\ninstitution may result in a reduction in value\nof some or all of its securities and, if the\nFund holds such securities or has entered into\na transaction with such a financial security\nwhen a bail-in occurs, the Fund may also be\nsimilarly impacted. Derivatives Risk. A\nderivative is a financial contract the value\nof which depends on, or is derived from, the\nvalue of an underlying asset, interest rate,\nor index. Derivative transactions typically\ninvolve leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a derivative\ntransaction will result in a loss greater than\nthe principal amount invested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price.\nRisks associated with derivative instruments\ninclude potential changes in value in response\nto interest rate changes or other market\ndevelopments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential\nfor the derivative transaction not to have the\neffect the Adviser anticipated or a different\nor less favorable effect than the Adviser\nanticipated; the failure of the counterparty\nto the derivative transaction to perform its\nobligations under the transaction or to settle\na trade; possible mispricing or improper\nvaluation of the derivative instrument;\nimperfect correlation in the value of a\nderivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that the\nFund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be\nable to recover the collateral or margin in\nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or\nbankruptcy; the risk that the Fund will\nexperience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio\n\n6\n\ninvestments; the risks specific to the asset\nunderlying the derivative instrument; lack of\nliquidity for the derivative instrument,\nincluding, without limitation, absence of a\nsecondary trading market; the potential for\nreduced returns to the Fund due to losses on\nthe transaction and an increase in volatility;\nthe potential for the derivative transaction\nto have the effect of accelerating the\nrecognition of gain; and legal risks arising\nfrom the documentation relating to the\nderivative transaction. Futures Contract Risk\n. The risk of loss relating to the use of\nfutures contracts is potentially unlimited.\nThe ability to establish and close out\npositions in futures contracts will be subject\nto the development and maintenance of a liquid\nsecondary market. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract or\nat any particular time. In the event no such\nmarket exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will\nbe unable to terminate the futures contract.\nIn using futures contracts, the Fund will be\nreliant on the ability of the Adviser to\npredict market and price movements correctly;\nthe skills needed to use such futures\ncontracts successfully are different from\nthose needed for traditional portfolio\nmanagement. If the Fund uses futures contracts\nfor hedging purposes, there is a risk of\nimperfect correlation between movements in the\nprices of the futures contracts and movements\nin the securities or index underlying the\nfutures contracts or movements in the prices\nof the Fund's investments that are the subject\nof such hedge. The prices of futures\ncontracts, for a number of reasons, may not\ncorrelate perfectly with movements in the\nsecurities or index underlying them. For\nexample, participants in the futures markets\nare subject to margin deposit requirements.\nSuch requirements may cause investors to take\nactions with respect to their futures\npositions that they would not otherwise take.\nThe margin requirements in the futures markets\nmay be less onerous than margin requirements\nin the securities markets in general, and as a\nresult those markets may attract more\nspeculators than the securities markets do.\nIncreased participation by speculators in\nthose markets may cause temporary price\ndistortions. Due to the possibility of price\ndistortion, even a correct forecast of general\nmarket trends by the Adviser still may not\nresult in a successful futures activity over a\nvery short time period. The risk of a position\nin a futures contract may be very large\ncompared to the relatively low level of margin\nthe Fund is required to deposit. A Fund will\ntypically be required to post margin with its\nfutures commission merchant in connection with\nits transactions in futures contracts. In many\ncases, a relatively small price movement in a\nfutures contract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund will incur brokerage fees in\nconnection with its futures transactions. In\nthe event of an insolvency of the futures\ncommission merchant or a clearing house, the\nFund may not be able to recover all (or any)\nof the margin it has posted with the futures\ncommission merchant, or to realize the value\nof any increase in the price of its positions,\nor it may experience a significant delay in\ndoing so. The Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) and the various\nexchanges have established limits referred to\nas \u201c speculative position limits \u201d on the\nmaximum net long or net short positions that\nany person and certain affiliated entities may\nhold or control in a particular futures\ncontract. In addition, federal position limits\napply to swaps that are economically\nequivalent to futures contracts that are\nsubject to CFTC-set speculative limits. All\npositions owned or controlled by the same\nperson or entity, even if in different\naccounts, must be aggregated for purposes of\ncomplying with position limits. It is possible\nthat the positions of different clients\nmanaged by the Adviser may be aggregated for\nthis purpose. Therefore, the trading decisions\nof the Adviser may have to be modified and\npositions held by the Fund liquidated in order\nto avoid exceeding such limits. The\nmodification of investment decisions or the\nelimination of open positions, if it occurs,\nmay adversely affect the performance of the\nFund. A violation of position limits could\nalso lead to regulatory action materially\nadverse to the Fund's investment strategy. In\naddition, exchanges may establish\naccountability levels applicable to a futures\ncontract instead of position limits, provided\nthat the futures contract is not subject to\nfederal position limits. An exchange may order\na person who holds or controls a position in\nexcess of a position accountability level not\nto further increase its position, to comply\nwith any prospective limit that exceeds the\nsize of the position owned or controlled, or\nto reduce any open position that exceeds the\nposition accountability level if the exchange\ndetermines that such action is necessary to\nmaintain an orderly market. Position\naccountability levels could adversely affect\nthe Fund's ability to establish and maintain\npositions in commodity futures contracts to\nwhich such levels apply, if the Fund were to\ntrade in such contracts, and the Fund's\nability to achieve its investment objective.\nFutures contracts traded on markets outside\nthe U.S. are not generally subject to the same\nlevel of regulation by the CFTC or other U.S.\nregulatory entities as contracts traded in the\nU.S., including without limitation as to the\nexecution, delivery, and clearing of\ntransactions. U.S. regulators neither regulate\nthe activities of a foreign exchange, nor have\nthe power to compel enforcement of the rules\nof the foreign exchange or the laws of the\n\n7\n\nforeign country in question. Margin and other\npayments made by the Fund may not be afforded\nthe same protections as are afforded those\npayments in the U.S., including in connection\nwith the insolvency of an executing or\nclearing broker or a clearinghouse or\nexchange. Certain foreign futures contracts\nmay be less liquid and more volatile than U.S.\ncontracts. Dividend-Paying Securities Risk .\nSecurities that pay dividends, as a group, can\nfall out of favor with the market, causing\nsuch companies to underperform companies that\ndo not pay dividends. In addition, changes in\nthe dividend policies of the companies held by\nthe Fund or the capital resources available\nfor such company's dividend payments may\nadversely affect the Fund. Equity Investing\nRisk . The market prices of equity securities\nowned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes\nrapidly or unpredictably. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer, such\nas management performance, financial leverage,\nnon-compliance with regulatory requirements,\nand reduced demand for the issuer's goods or\nservices. The values of equity securities also\nmay decline due to general industry or market\nconditions that are not specifically related\nto a particular company, such as real or\nperceived adverse economic conditions, changes\nin the general outlook for corporate earnings,\nchanges in interest or currency rates, or\nadverse investor sentiment generally. In\naddition, equity markets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause stock prices to fall\nover short or extended periods of time.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk . The net asset value of\nFund Shares will generally fluctuate with\nchanges in the market value of the Fund's\nsecurities holdings. The market prices of Fund\nShares will generally fluctuate in accordance\nwith changes in the Fund's net asset value and\nsupply and demand of Fund Shares on the\nExchange. It cannot be predicted whether Fund\nShares will trade below, at or above their net\nasset value. Price differences may be due, in\nlarge part, to the fact that supply and demand\nforces at work in the secondary trading market\nfor Fund Shares will be closely related to,\nbut not identical to, the same forces\ninfluencing the prices of the securities of\nthe Index trading individually or in the\naggregate at any point in time. The market\nprices of Fund Shares may deviate\nsignificantly from the net asset value of Fund\nShares during periods of market volatility.\nHowever, given that Fund Shares can be created\nand redeemed in Creation Units (unlike shares\nof many closed-end funds, which frequently\ntrade at appreciable discounts from, and\nsometimes at premiums to, their net asset\nvalue), the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts or premiums to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares should not be sustained over\nlong periods. While the creation/redemption\nfeature is designed to make it likely that\nFund Shares normally will trade close to the\nFund's net asset value, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions or market volatility\nmay result in trading prices that differ\nsignificantly from the Fund's net asset value.\nIf an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to the\nnet asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a\ntime when the market price is at a discount to\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, then the\ninvestor may sustain losses. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk . The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy,\nattempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities. The Fund will\nseek to provide investment results that\ncorrespond generally to the performance of the\nIndex, regardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. The\nFund generally will buy and will not sell a\nsecurity included in the Index as long as the\nsecurity is part of the Index regardless of\nany sudden or material decline in value or\nforeseeable material decline in value of the\nsecurity, even though the Adviser may make a\ndifferent investment decision for other\nactively managed accounts or portfolios that\nhold the security. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of\na portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Index (in absolute terms and\nby comparison with other indices) and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index\nin accordance with its methodology may occur\nfrom time to time and may not be identified\nand corrected by the Index Provider for a\nperiod of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index\nmay include, and the Fund may therefore hold\nfor a period of time, securities of companies\nthat do not align with the Index's objective\nand/or criteria. While the Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance of the Index (i.e.,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's return may not match the\nreturn of the Index for a number of reasons.\nFor example, the return on the sample of\nsecurities purchased by the Fund (or the\nreturn on securities not included in the\nIndex) may not correlate precisely with the\nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number\nof operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, either\n\n8\n\nas a result of cash flows into or out of the\nFund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to\nmeet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in\nsome securities not included in the Index,\npotentially increasing the risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's return and that of the\nIndex. Changes in the composition of the Index\nand regulatory requirements also may impact\nthe Fund's ability to match the return of the\nIndex. The Adviser may apply one or more \u201c\nscreens \u201d or investment techniques to refine\nor limit the number or types of issuers\nincluded in the Index in which the Fund may\ninvest. Application of such screens or\ntechniques may result in investment\nperformance below that of the Index and may\nnot produce results expected by the Adviser.\nIndex tracking risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. Pursuant to the\nIndex methodology, a security may be removed\nfrom the Index in the event that it does not\ncomply with the eligibility requirements of\nthe Index. As a result, the Fund may be forced\nto sell securities at inopportune times and/or\nunfavorable prices due to these changes in the\nIndex components. When there are changes made\nto the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its\nportfolio to attempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the Fund's portfolio and\nthe Index, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes\nwill be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unscheduled changes to the Index\nmay expose the Fund to additional tracking\nerror risk. The Fund may recognize gains as a\nresult of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to distribute any such\ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse\nfederal income tax consequences. Leveraging\nRisk . Borrowing transactions, reverse\nrepurchase agreements, certain derivatives\ntransactions, securities lending transactions\nand other investment transactions such as\nwhen-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward\ncommitment transactions may create investment\nleverage. If the Fund engages in transactions\nthat have a leveraging effect on the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio, the value of the Fund\nwill be potentially more volatile and all\nother risks will tend to be compounded. This\nis because leverage generally creates\ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than the Fund would otherwise have\nand so magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to\nbe a speculative investment practice and may\nresult in losses to the Fund. Certain\nderivatives have the potential for unlimited\nloss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause the\nFund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,\ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to\nmeet asset coverage requirements. Liquidity\nRisk . Liquidity risk is the risk that the\nFund may not be able to dispose of investments\nreadily at a favorable time or prices (or at\nall) or at prices approximating those at which\nthe Fund currently values them. For example,\ncertain investments may be subject to\nrestrictions on resale, may trade in the over-\nthe-counter market or in limited volume, or\nmay not have an active trading market.\nIlliquid investments may trade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more liquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide fluctuations in market\nvalue. It may be difficult for the Fund to\nvalue illiquid investments accurately. The\nmarket for certain investments may become\nilliquid under adverse market or economic\nconditions independent of any specific adverse\nchanges in the conditions of a particular\nissuer. If the liquidity of the Fund's\nholdings deteriorates, it may lead to\ndifferences between the market price of Fund\nShares and the net asset value of Fund Shares,\nand could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Disposal of illiquid investments may\nentail registration expenses and other\ntransaction costs that are higher than those\nfor liquid investments. The Fund may seek to\nborrow money to meet its obligations\n(including among other things redemption\nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of\nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing\nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund.\nMarket Risk . Market prices of investments\nheld by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes\nrapidly or unpredictably. The Fund's\ninvestments are subject to changes in general\neconomic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in\ninvestment in securities markets. Investment\nmarkets can be volatile, and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors, including, but not limited\nto, economic growth or recession, changes in\ninterest rates, inflation, changes in actual\nor perceived creditworthiness of issuers and\ngeneral market liquidity. Even if general\neconomic conditions do not change, the value\nof an investment in the Fund could decline if\nthe particular industries, sectors or\ncompanies in which the Fund invests do not\nperform well or are adversely affected by\nevents. Further, legal, political, regulatory\nand tax changes also may cause fluctuations in\nmarkets and securities prices. Local, regional\nor global events such as war, military\nconflicts, acts of terrorism, natural\ndisasters, the spread of infectious illness or\nother public health issues, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments.\n\n9\n\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in\nmajor disruptions to economies and markets\naround the world, including the United States.\nAlthough vaccines have been developed and\napproved for use by various governments, the\nduration of the pandemic and its effects\ncannot be predicted with certainty. COVID-19,\nand efforts to contain its spread, have\ncontributed to, and may continue to contribute\nto, market volatility, inflation, reduced\nliquidity of certain instruments, supply chain\ndisruptions, and systemic economic weakness,\nand trading in many instruments was and may\ncontinue to be disrupted as a result. In\nresponse, governments and central banks,\nincluding the Federal Reserve in the United\nStates, have taken extraordinary and\nunprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal economies and the financial markets.\nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective to mitigate the economic and\nmarket disruption, will not be known for some\ntime. The foregoing could impact the Fund and\nits investments and result in disruptions to\nthe services provided to the Fund by its\nservice providers. Additionally, in March\n2023, the shutdown of certain financial\ninstitutions raised economic concerns over\ndisruption in the U.S. banking system. There\ncan be no certainty that the actions taken by\nthe U.S. government to strengthen public\nconfidence in the U.S. banking system will be\neffective in mitigating the effects of\nfinancial institution failures on the economy\nand restoring public confidence in the U.S.\nbanking system. New Fund Risk . The Fund is\nnew and there is no assurance that the Fund\nwill grow quickly. When the Fund's size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume, which could lead to wider bid/ask\nspreads. In addition, the Fund may face the\nrisk of being delisted if the Fund does not\nmeet certain conditions of the listing\nexchange. Any resulting liquidation of the\nFund could cause elevated transaction costs\nfor the Fund and negative tax consequences for\nits shareholders. Non-Diversification Risk .\nAs a \u201c non-diversified \u201d fund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number of portfolio securities\nthan many other funds. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively small number of\nissuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may\naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund\nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome diversified for periods of time solely\nas a result of tracking the Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Technology Sector Risk . Market\nor economic factors impacting technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major\neffect on the value of the Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of technology companies\nand companies that rely heavily on technology\nis particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and\ninternationally, including competition from\nforeign competitors with lower production\ncosts. Technology companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,\nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual\nproperty rights, the loss or impairment of\nwhich may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology\nsector may face dramatic and often\nunpredictable changes in growth rates and\ncompetition for the services of qualified\npersonnel. Unconstrained Sector Risk . The\nFund may invest a substantial portion of its\nassets within one or more economic sectors or\nindustries, which may change from time to\ntime. When the Fund focuses its investments in\na particular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector,\nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nNon-Principal Risks Authorized Participants,\nMarket Makers and Liquidity Providers\nConcentration Risk. The Fund has a limited\nnumber of financial institutions that may act\nas Authorized Participants ( \u201c APs \u201d ), which\nare responsible for the creation and\nredemption activity for the Fund. In addition,\nthere may be a limited number of market makers\nand/or liquidity providers in the marketplace.\nTo the extent either of the following events\noccur, Fund Shares may trade at a material\ndiscount to NAV and possibly face delisting:\n(i) APs exit the business or otherwise become\nunable to process creation and/or redemption\norders and no other APs step forward to\nperform these services, or (ii) market makers\nand/or liquidity providers exit the business\nor significantly reduce their business\nactivities and no other entities step forward\nto perform their functions.\n\n10\n\nCash Transaction Risk . To the extent the Fund\nsells portfolio securities to meet some or all\nof a redemption request with cash, the Fund\nmay incur taxable gains or losses that it\nmight not have incurred had it made\nredemptions entirely in-kind. As a result, the\nFund may pay out higher annual capital gain\ndistributions than if the in-kind redemption\nprocess was used. Concentration Risk . The\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to\nthe extent that the Fund's underlying Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group\nof industries. When the Fund focuses its\ninvestments in a particular industry or\nsector, financial, economic, business, and\nother developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have\na greater effect on the Fund than if it had\nnot focused its assets in that industry,\nmarket, or economic sector, which may increase\nthe volatility of the Fund. Conflicts of\nInterest Risk. An investment in the Fund will\nbe subject to a number of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest. For example, the\nAdviser or its affiliates may provide services\nto the Fund, such as securities lending agency\nservices, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer\nagency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for\nwhich the Fund would compensate the Adviser\nand/or such affiliates. The Fund may invest in\nother pooled investment vehicles sponsored,\nmanaged, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which the Fund pays fees or expenses to the\nAdviser or its affiliates, or the terms on\nwhich it enters into transactions with the\nAdviser or its affiliates will be the most\nfavorable available in the market generally or\nas favorable as the rates the Adviser or its\naffiliates make available to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of the\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements. The Adviser and its\naffiliates serve as investment adviser to\nother clients and may make investment\ndecisions that may be different from those\nthat will be made by the Adviser on behalf of\nthe Fund. For example, the Adviser may provide\nasset allocation advice to some clients that\nmay include a recommendation to invest in or\nredeem from particular issuers while not\nproviding that same recommendation to all\nclients invested in the same or similar\nissuers. The Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to\npurchase (or sell) investments for the Fund\nand to sell (or purchase) the same investment\nfor accounts, funds, or structured products\nfor which it serves as asset manager, or for\nother clients or affiliates. The Adviser and\nits affiliates may invest for clients in\nvarious securities that are senior, pari passu\nor junior to, or have interests different from\nor adverse to, the securities that are owned\nby the Fund. The Adviser or its affiliates, in\nconnection with its other business activities,\nmay acquire material nonpublic confidential\ninformation that may restrict the Adviser from\npurchasing securities or selling securities\nfor itself or its clients (including the Fund)\nor otherwise using such information for the\nbenefit of its clients or itself. The\nforegoing does not purport to be a\ncomprehensive list or complete explanation of\nall potential conflicts of interests which may\naffect the Fund. The Fund may encounter\ncircumstances, or enter into transactions, in\nwhich conflicts of interest that are not\nlisted or discussed above may arise. Costs of\nBuying and Selling Shares . Investors buying\nor selling Fund Shares in the secondary market\nwill pay brokerage commissions or other\ncharges imposed by brokers, as determined by\nthat broker. Brokerage commissions are often a\nfixed amount and may be a significant\nproportional cost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell relatively small amounts of Fund\nShares. In addition, secondary market\ninvestors will also incur the cost of the\ndifference between the price that an investor\nis willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201c bid \u201d\nprice) and the price at which an investor is\nwilling to sell Fund Shares (the \u201c ask \u201d\nprice). This difference in bid and ask prices\nis often referred to as the \u201c spread \u201d or \u201c\nbid/ask spread. \u201d The bid/ask spread varies\nover time for Fund Shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and is generally\nlower if Fund Shares have more trading volume\nand market liquidity and higher if Fund Shares\nhave little trading volume and market\nliquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask\nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,\nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may\nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making\nsmall investments. Cybersecurity Risk . With\nthe increased use of technologies such as the\nInternet and the dependence on computer\nsystems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, funds (such as the Fund) and their\nservice providers (including the Adviser) may\nbe prone to operational and information\nsecurity risks resulting from cyber-attacks\nand/or technological malfunctions. In general,\ncyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects.\nCyber-attacks include, among others, stealing\nor corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate\n\n11\n\nusers from accessing information or services\non a website, releasing confidential\ninformation without authorization, and causing\noperational disruption. Successful cyber-\nattacks against, or security breakdowns of,\nthe Fund, the Adviser or a custodian, transfer\nagent, or other affiliated or third-party\nservice provider may adversely affect the Fund\nor its shareholders. For instance, cyber-\nattacks or technical malfunctions may\ninterfere with the processing of shareholder\nor other transactions, affect the Fund's\nability to calculate its NAV, cause the\nrelease of private shareholder information or\nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject the\nFund to regulatory fines, penalties or\nfinancial losses, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and additional compliance\ncosts. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions\nmay render records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder ownership of Fund\nShares, and other data integral to the\nfunctioning of the Fund inaccessible or\ninaccurate or incomplete. The Fund may also\nincur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement in order to prevent cyber incidents\nin the future. The Fund and its shareholders\ncould be negatively impacted as a result.\nWhile the Adviser has established a business\ncontinuity plan and systems designed to\nminimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the\nuse of technology, processes and controls,\nthere are inherent limitations in such plans\nand systems, including the possibility that\ncertain risks have not been identified, given\nthe evolving nature of this threat. The Fund\nrelies on third-party service providers for\nmany of its day-to-day operations, and will be\nsubject to the risk that the protections and\nprotocols implemented by those service\nproviders will be ineffective to protect the\nFund from cyber-attack. The Adviser does not\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems\nput in place by third-party service providers,\nand such third-party service providers may\nhave limited indemnification obligations to\nthe Adviser or the Fund. Similar types of\ncybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions\nalso are present for issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which could result in\nmaterial adverse consequences for such\nissuers, and may cause the Fund's investment\nin such securities to lose value. Index\nConstruction Risk . A security included in the\nIndex may not exhibit the characteristic or\nprovide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently the Fund's holdings\nmay not exhibit returns consistent with that\ncharacteristic or exposure. Index Licensing\nRisk . It is possible that the license under\nwhich the Adviser or the Fund is permitted to\nreplicate or otherwise use the Index will be\nterminated or may be disputed, impaired or\ncease to remain in effect. In such a case, the\nAdviser may be required to replace the Index\nwith another index which it considers to be\nappropriate in light of the investment\nstrategy of the Fund. The use of any such\nsubstitute index may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund's performance. In the event that the\nAdviser is unable to identify a suitable\nreplacement for the Index, it may determine to\nterminate the Fund. Money Market Risk . An\ninvestment in a money market fund is not a\ndeposit of any bank and is not insured or\nguaranteed by the FDIC or any other government\nagency. Certain money market funds seek to\npreserve the value of their shares at $1.00\nper share, although there can be no assurance\nthat they will do so, and it is possible to\nlose money by investing in such a money market\nfund. A major or unexpected change in interest\nrates or a decline in the credit quality of an\nissuer or entity providing credit support, an\ninactive trading market for money market\ninstruments, or adverse market, economic,\nindustry, political, regulatory, geopolitical,\nand other conditions could cause the share\nprice of such a money market fund to fall\nbelow $1.00. It is possible that such a money\nmarket fund will issue and redeem shares at\n$1.00 per share at times when the fair value\nof the money market fund's portfolio per share\nis more or less than $1.00. None of State\nStreet Corporation, State Street, State Street\nGlobal Advisors, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA \u201d ), SSGA FM or\ntheir affiliates ( \u201c State Street Entities \u201d )\nguarantee the value of an investment in a\nmoney market fund at $1.00 per share.\nInvestors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from\nState Street Entities. Other money market\nfunds price and transact at a \u201c floating \u201d NAV\nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the\nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or\nless than their original purchase price.\nRecent changes in the regulation of money\nmarket funds may affect the operations and\nstructures of money market funds. A money\nmarket fund may be permitted or required to\nimpose redemption fees or to impose\nlimitations on redemptions during periods of\nhigh illiquidity in the markets for the\ninvestments held by it. Portfolio Turnover\nRisk . The Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to the Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of securities\nand reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover\nhave the effect of reducing the Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities\nby the Fund may result in the realization of\ntaxable capital gains,\n\n12\n\nincluding short-term capital gains. The Fund\nmay engage in significant trading of its\nportfolio securities in connection with Index\nrebalancing. Frequent or significant trading\nmay cause the Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does\nnot engage in frequent or significant trading.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend\nportfolio securities in an amount not to\nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For\nthese purposes, net assets shall exclude the\nvalue of all assets received as collateral for\nthe loan. Such loans may be terminated at any\ntime. Any such loans must be continuously\nsecured by collateral maintained on a current\nbasis in an amount at least equal to the\nmarket value of the securities loaned by the\nFund, marked to market each trading day. The\nFund will receive the amount of all dividends,\ninterest and other distributions on the loaned\nsecurities; however, the borrower has the\nright to vote the loaned securities. The Fund\nwill call loans to vote proxies if a material\nissue affecting the investment is to be voted\nupon. Efforts to recall such securities\npromptly may be unsuccessful, especially for\nforeign securities or thinly traded\nsecurities. Securities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. Should the borrower of the securities\nfail financially, the Fund may experience\ndelays in recovering the securities or\nexercising its rights in the collateral. Loans\nare made only to borrowers that are deemed by\nthe securities lending agent to be of good\nfinancial standing. In a loan transaction, the\nFund will also bear the risk of any decline in\nvalue of securities provided as collateral or\nacquired with cash collateral. The Fund will\nattempt to minimize this risk by limiting the\ninvestment of cash collateral to high quality\ninstruments of short maturity either directly\non behalf of the lending Fund or through one\nor more joint accounts or funds, which may\ninclude those managed by the Adviser. To the\nextent the collateral provided or investments\nmade with cash collateral differ from\nsecurities included in the Index, such\ncollateral or investments may have a greater\nrisk of loss than the securities included in\nthe Index. In addition, the Fund will be\nsubject to the risk that any income generated\nby lending its securities or reinvesting cash\ncollateral is lower than any fees the Fund has\nagreed to pay a borrower. The Adviser will\ntake into account the tax impact to\nshareholders of substitute payments for\ndividends when overseeing the Fund's\nsecurities lending activity. Trading Issues .\nAlthough Fund Shares are listed for trading on\nthe Exchange and may be listed or traded on\nU.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than\nthe Exchange, there can be no assurance that\nan active trading market for the Fund Shares\nwill develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund\nShares on the Exchange may be halted due to\nmarket conditions or for reasons that, in the\nview of the Exchange, make trading in Fund\nShares inadvisable. In addition, trading in\nFund Shares on the Exchange is subject to\ntrading halts caused by extraordinary market\nvolatility pursuant to Exchange \u201c circuit\nbreaker \u201d rules. Similar to the shares of\noperating companies listed on a stock\nexchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and\nare therefore subject to the risk of increased\nvolatility in the trading price of the Fund's\nshares. While the Fund expects that the\nability of Authorized Participants to create\nand redeem Fund Shares at net asset value\nshould be effective in reducing any such\nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such\nshort sales. There can be no assurance that\nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of the Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that\nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at\nall, on any stock exchange. Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund and, subject to\nthe oversight of the Board, is responsible for\nthe investment management of the Fund. The\nAdviser provides an investment management\nprogram for the Fund and manages the\ninvestment of the Fund's assets. In addition,\nthe Adviser will provide administrative,\ncompliance and general management services to\nthe Fund. The Adviser is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Global Advisors,\nInc., which is itself a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Corporation. The\nAdviser is registered with the SEC under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nThe Adviser and certain other affiliates of\nState Street Corporation make up SSGA. SSGA is\none of the world's largest institutional money\nmanagers and the investment management arm of\nState Street Corporation. As of [ ], 2023, the\nAdviser managed approximately $[ ] billion in\nassets and SSGA managed approximately $[ ]\ntrillion in assets. The Adviser's principal\nbusiness address is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. For the services provided\nto the Fund under the Investment Advisory\nAgreement, the Fund expects to pay the Adviser\nthe annual fee based on a percentage of the\nFund's average daily net assets as set forth\nbelow:\n\n13\n                                              \n  SPDR Portfolio S&P Sector Neutral  [0.XX]%  \n  Dividend ETF                                \n                                              \nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all\nor a portion of its management fee. The\nAdviser has contractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fee and/or reimburse\nexpenses in an amount equal to any acquired\nfund fees and expenses (excluding holdings in\nacquired funds for cash management purposes,\nif any) for the Fund until [ ]. This waiver\nand/or reimbursement does not provide for the\nrecoupment by the Adviser of any amounts\nwaived or reimbursed. This waiver and/or\nreimbursement may not be terminated prior to [\n] except with the approval of the Board. The\nAdviser pays all expenses of the Fund other\nthan the management fee, brokerage expenses,\ntaxes, interest, fees and expenses of the\nIndependent Trustees (including any Trustee's\ncounsel fees), litigation expenses, acquired\nfund fees and expenses and other extraordinary\nexpenses. A summary of the factors considered\nby the Board in connection with the initial\napproval of the Investment Advisory Agreement\nfor the Fund will be available in the Fund's\nannual report for the period ended [ ]. SSGA\nFM, as the investment adviser for the Fund,\nmay hire one or more sub-advisers to oversee\nthe day-to-day investment activities of the\nFund. The sub-advisers are subject to\noversight by the Adviser. The Adviser and SPDR\nSeries Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) have received an\nexemptive order from the SEC that permits the\nAdviser, with the approval of the Board,\nincluding a majority of the Independent\nTrustees, of the Trust, to retain and amend\nexisting sub-advisory agreements with\nunaffiliated investment sub-advisers for the\nFund without submitting the sub-advisory\nagreement to a vote of the Fund's\nshareholders. The Trust will notify\nshareholders in the event of any change in the\nidentity of such sub-adviser or sub-advisers.\nThe Adviser has ultimate responsibility for\nthe investment performance of the Fund due to\nits responsibility to oversee each sub-adviser\nand recommend their hiring, termination and\nreplacement. The Adviser is not required to\ndisclose fees paid to any unaffiliated sub-\nadviser retained pursuant to the order.\nPortfolio Managers.\nThe Fund is managed using a team of investment\nprofessionals. The team approach is used to\ncreate an environment that encourages the flow\nof investment ideas. The portfolio managers\nwithin the team work together in a cohesive\nmanner to develop and enhance techniques that\ndrive the investment process for the\ninvestment strategy. This approach requires\nportfolio managers to share a variety of\nresponsibilities including investment strategy\nand analysis while retaining responsibility\nfor the implementation of the strategy within\nany particular portfolio. The approach also\nenables the team to draw upon the resources of\nother groups within SSGA. The portfolio\nmanagement team is overseen by the SSGA\nInvestment Committee. The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Emiliano\nRabinovich, Juan Acevedo and Ted Janowsky.\nEmiliano Rabinovich, CFA, is a Managing\nDirector of SSGA and the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group.

Additional\nPurchase and Sale Information Fund Shares are\nlisted for secondary trading on the Exchange\nand individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. The secondary markets\nare closed on weekends and also are generally\nclosed on the following holidays: New Year's\nDay, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Juneteenth National Independence\nDay, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving\nDay and Christmas Day. The Exchange may close\nearly on the business day before certain\nholidays and on the day after Thanksgiving\nDay. Exchange holiday schedules are subject to\nchange without notice. If you buy or sell Fund\nShares in the secondary market, you will pay\nthe secondary market price for Fund Shares. In\naddition, you may incur customary brokerage\ncommissions and charges and may pay some or\nall of the spread between the bid and the\noffered price in the secondary market on each\nleg of a round trip (purchase and sale)\ntransaction. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nwill fluctuate continuously throughout trading\nhours based on market supply and demand rather\nthan the Fund's net asset value, which is\ncalculated at the end of each business day.\nFund Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nprices that may be above ( i.e ., at a\npremium) or below ( i.e ., at a discount), to\nvarying degrees, the daily net asset value of\nFund Shares. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nmay deviate significantly from the Fund's net\nasset value during periods of market\nvolatility. Given, however, that Fund Shares\ncan be issued and redeemed daily in Creation\nUnits, the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts and premiums to net asset value\nshould not be sustained over long periods.\n\n16\n\nThe Exchange will disseminate, every fifteen\nseconds during the regular trading day, an\nindicative optimized portfolio value ( \u201c IOPV\n\u201d ) relating to the Fund. The IOPV\ncalculations are estimates of the value of the\nFund's net asset value per Fund Share.\nPremiums and discounts between the IOPV and\nthe market price may occur. This should not be\nviewed as a \u201c real-time \u201d update of the net\nasset value per Fund Share. The IOPV is based\non the current market value of the published\nbasket of portfolio securities and/or cash\nrequired to be deposited in exchange for a\nCreation Unit and does not necessarily reflect\nthe precise composition of the Fund's actual\nportfolio at a particular point in time.\nMoreover, the IOPV is generally determined by\nusing current market quotations and/or price\nquotations obtained from broker-dealers and\nother market intermediaries and valuations\nbased on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the\nNAV, which (i) is computed only once a day,\n(ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be\nsubject, in accordance with the requirements\nof the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at\ndifferent prices than those used in the\ncalculations of the IOPV. When applicable, the\nIOPV price is based on quotes and closing\nprices from the securities' local market\nconverted into U.S. dollars at the current\ncurrency rates and may not reflect events that\noccur subsequent to the local market's close.\nTherefore, the IOPV may not reflect the best\npossible valuation of the Fund's current\nportfolio. Neither the Fund nor the Adviser or\nany of their affiliates are involved in, or\nresponsible for, the calculation or\ndissemination of such IOPVs and make no\nwarranty as to their accuracy. The Fund does\nnot impose any restrictions on the frequency\nof purchases and redemptions; however, the\nFund reserves the right to reject or limit\npurchases at any time as described in the SAI.\nWhen considering that no restriction or policy\nwas necessary, the Board evaluated the risks\nposed by market timing activities, such as\nwhether frequent purchases and redemptions\nwould interfere with the efficient\nimplementation of the Fund's investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause the Fund\nto experience increased transaction costs. The\nBoard considered that, unlike traditional\nmutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and\nredeemed only in large quantities of shares\nknown as Creation Units, available only from\nthe Fund directly, and that most trading in\nthe Fund occurs on the Exchange at prevailing\nmarket prices and does not involve the Fund\ndirectly. Given this structure, the Board\ndetermined that it is unlikely that (a) market\ntiming would be attempted by the Fund's\nshareholders or (b) any attempts to market\ntime the Fund by shareholders would result in\nnegative impact to the Fund or its\nshareholders. Distributions Dividends and\nCapital Gains. As a Fund shareholder, you are\nentitled to your share of the Fund's income\nand net realized gains on its investments. The\nFund pays out substantially all of its net\nearnings to its shareholders as \u201c\ndistributions. \u201d The Fund may earn income\ndividends from stocks, interest from debt\nsecurities and, if participating, securities\nlending income. These amounts, net of expenses\nand taxes (if applicable), are passed along to\nFund shareholders as \u201c income dividend\ndistributions. \u201d The Fund will generally\nrealize short-term capital gains or losses\nwhenever it sells or exchanges assets held for\none year or less. Net short-term capital gains\nwill generally be treated as ordinary income\nwhen distributed to shareholders. The Fund\nwill generally realize long-term capital gains\nor losses whenever it sells or exchanges\nassets held for more than one year. Net\ncapital gains (the excess of the Fund's net\nlong-term capital gains over its net short-\nterm capital losses) are distributed to\nshareholders as \u201c capital gain distributions.\n\u201d Income dividend distributions, if any, are\ngenerally distributed to shareholders\nquarterly, but may vary significantly from\nperiod to period. Net capital gains for the\nFund are distributed at least annually.\nDividends may be declared and paid more\nfrequently or at any other time to improve\nIndex tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c Code \u201d\n). Distributions in cash may be reinvested\nautomatically in additional whole Fund Shares\nonly if the broker through whom you purchased\nFund Shares makes such option available.\nDistributions which are reinvested will\nnevertheless be taxable to the same extent as\nif such distributions had not been reinvested.\nPortfolio Holdings Disclosure The Fund's\nportfolio holdings disclosure policy is\ndescribed in the SAI. In addition, the\nidentities and quantities of the securities\nheld by the Fund are disclosed on the Fund's\nwebsite.\n\n17\n\nAdditional Tax Information The following\ndiscussion is a summary of some important U.S.\nfederal income tax considerations generally\napplicable to an investment in the Fund. Your\ninvestment in the Fund may have other tax\nimplications. Please consult your tax advisor\nabout federal, state, local, foreign or other\ntax laws applicable to you. Investors,\nincluding non-U.S. investors, may wish to\nconsult the SAI tax section for additional\ndisclosure. Taxes on Distributions. In\ngeneral, your distributions are subject to\nfederal income tax when they are paid, whether\nyou take them in cash or reinvest them in the\nFund. The income dividends and short-term\ncapital gains distributions you receive from\nthe Fund will be taxed as either ordinary\nincome or qualified dividend income. Subject\nto certain limitations, dividends that are\nreported by the Fund as qualified dividend\nincome are taxable to noncorporate\nshareholders at reduced rates. Any\ndistributions of the Fund's net capital gains\nare taxable as long-term capital gain\nregardless of how long you have owned Fund\nShares. Long-term capital gains are generally\ntaxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced\nrates. Distributions in excess of the Fund's\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits\nare treated as a tax-free return of capital to\nthe extent of your basis in the Fund's shares,\nand, in general, as capital gain thereafter.\nIn general, dividends may be reported by the\nFund as qualified dividend income if they are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by the Fund, which, in general,\nincludes dividend income from taxable U.S.\ncorporations and certain foreign corporations\n( i.e ., certain foreign corporations\nincorporated in a possession of the United\nStates or in certain countries with a\ncomprehensive tax treaty with the United\nStates, and certain other foreign corporations\nif the stock with respect to which the\ndividend is paid is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the United\nStates), provided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements in respect\nof the stock of such corporations and has not\nhedged its position in the stock in certain\nways. A dividend generally will not be treated\nas qualified dividend income if the dividend\nis received with respect to any share of stock\nheld by the Fund for fewer than 61 days during\nthe 121-day period beginning at the date which\nis 60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, for fewer than 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning 90 days before such\ndate. These holding period requirements will\nalso apply to your ownership of Fund Shares.\nHolding periods may be suspended for these\npurposes for stock that is hedged.\nAdditionally, income derived in connection\nwith the Fund's securities lending activities\nwill not be treated as qualified dividend\nincome. U.S. individuals with income exceeding\nspecified thresholds are subject to a 3.8%\nMedicare contribution tax on all or a portion\nof their \u201c net investment income, \u201d which\nincludes taxable interest, dividends and\ncertain capital gains (generally including\ncapital gain distributions and capital gains\nrealized upon the sale of Fund Shares). This\n3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of\nthe undistributed net investment income of\ncertain shareholders that are estates and\ntrusts. Certain tax-exempt educational\ninstitutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on\nnet investment income. For these purposes,\ncertain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. If you lend your Fund\nShares pursuant to securities lending\narrangements you may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends (paid while the Fund Shares are\nheld by the borrower) as qualified dividend\nincome. You should consult your financial\nintermediary or tax advisor to discuss your\nparticular circumstances. Distributions paid\nin January, but declared by the Fund in\nOctober, November or December of the previous\nyear, payable to shareholders of record in\nsuch a month, may be taxable to you in the\ncalendar year in which they were declared. The\nFund will inform you of the amount of your\nordinary income dividends, qualified dividend\nincome and capital gain distributions shortly\nafter the close of each calendar year. A\ndistribution will reduce the Fund's net asset\nvalue per Fund Share and may be taxable to you\nas ordinary income or capital gain even\nthough, from an investment standpoint, the\ndistribution may constitute a return of\ncapital. Derivatives and Other Complex\nSecurities. The Fund may invest in complex\nsecurities. These investments may be subject\nto numerous special and complex rules. These\nrules could affect whether gains and losses\nrecognized by the Fund are treated as ordinary\nincome or capital gain, accelerate the\nrecognition of income to the Fund and/or defer\nthe Fund's ability to recognize losses. In\nturn, these rules may affect the amount,\ntiming or character of the income distributed\nto you by the Fund. You should consult your\npersonal tax advisor regarding the application\nof these rules.\n\n18\n\nTaxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund Shares is generally treated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for more than one year and as short-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for one year or less, except that any\ncapital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held\nfor six months or less is treated as long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect to the Fund\nShares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of\nCreation Units. A person who exchanges\nsecurities for Creation Units generally will\nrecognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss\nwill be equal to the difference between the\nmarket value of the Creation Units at the time\nand the exchanger's aggregate basis in the\nsecurities surrendered plus any cash paid for\nthe Creation Units. A person who exchanges\nCreation Units for securities will generally\nrecognize a gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between the exchanger's basis in\nthe Creation Units and the aggregate market\nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash\nreceived. The Internal Revenue Service (the \u201c\nIRS \u201d ), however, may assert that a loss\nrealized upon an exchange of securities for\nCreation Units cannot be deducted currently\nunder the rules governing \u201c wash sales, \u201d or\non the basis that there has been no\nsignificant change in economic position.\nPersons exchanging securities should consult\ntheir own tax advisor with respect to whether\nwash sale rules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. Under current federal tax laws,\nany capital gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption (or creation) of Creation Units is\ngenerally treated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if the Fund Shares (or securities\nsurrendered) have been held for more than one\nyear and as a short-term capital gain or loss\nif the Fund Shares (or securities surrendered)\nhave been held for one year or less. If you\ncreate or redeem Creation Units, you will be\nsent a confirmation statement showing how many\nFund Shares you purchased or sold and at what\nprice. The Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has\nthe right to reject an order for Creation\nUnits if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund and if,\npursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the Fund\nwould have a basis in the securities different\nfrom the market value of the securities on the\ndate of deposit. The Trust also has the right\nto require information necessary to determine\nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If the Trust does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund, the purchaser\n(or group of purchasers) will not recognize\ngain or loss upon the exchange of securities\nfor Creation Units. If the Fund redeems\nCreation Units in cash, it may bear additional\ncosts and recognize more capital gains than it\nwould if it redeems Creation Units in-kind.\nNon-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income dividends\npaid by the Fund to shareholders who are non-\nresident aliens or foreign entities will\ngenerally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding\ntax (other than distributions reported by the\nFund as interest-related dividends and short-\nterm capital gain dividends), unless a lower\ntreaty rate applies or unless such income is\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness. In general, the Fund may report\ninterest-related dividends to the extent of\nits net income derived from U.S. source\ninterest, and the Fund may report short-term\ncapital gain dividends to the extent its net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year\nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains\non the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that\nare, in each case, effectively connected with\nthe conduct of a trade or business within the\nU.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal\nnet income taxation at regular income tax\nrates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of the\nFund's shares are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning special tax rules that\nmay apply to their investment. Unless certain\nnon-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply\nwith IRS requirements that will generally\nrequire them to report information regarding\nU.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts\nwith, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply to distributions payable to such\nentities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt\nfrom the withholding described in this\nparagraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S.\nand a foreign government, provided that the\nshareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such\nagreement. Backup Withholding. The Fund will\nbe required in certain cases to withhold (as \u201c\nbackup withholding \u201d ) on amounts payable to\nany shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\n\n19\n\nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been\nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the United States.\nOther Tax Issues. The Fund may be subject to\ntax in certain states where the Fund does\nbusiness (or is treated as doing business as a\nresult of its investments). Furthermore, in\nthose states which have income tax laws, the\ntax treatment of the Fund and of Fund\nshareholders with respect to distributions by\nthe Fund may differ from federal tax\ntreatment. The foregoing discussion summarizes\nsome of the consequences under current federal\nincome tax law of an investment in the Fund.\nIt is not a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. Consult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax consequences of an\ninvestment in the Fund under all applicable\ntax laws. General Information The Trust was\norganized as a Massachusetts business trust on\nJune 12, 1998. If shareholders of the Fund are\nrequired to vote on any matters, shareholders\nare entitled to one vote for each Fund Share\nthey own. Annual meetings of shareholders will\nnot be held except as required by the 1940 Act\nand other applicable law. See the SAI for more\ninformation concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization The\nFund is a separate series of the Trust, which\nis an open-end registered management\ninvestment company. From time to time, the\nFund may advertise yield and total return\nfigures. Yield is a historical measure of\ndividend income, and total return is a measure\nof past dividend income (assuming that it has\nbeen reinvested) plus capital appreciation.\nNeither yield nor total return should be used\nto predict the future performance of the Fund.\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel\nto the Trust, including the Fund.

The\nTrust was organized as a Massachusetts\nbusiness trust on June 12, 1998. The offering\nof the Fund's shares ( \u201c Shares \u201d ) is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c Securities Act \u201d ). The\ninvestment objective of the Fund is to provide\ninvestment results that, before fees and\nexpenses, correspond generally to the total\nreturn of a specified market index (each an \u201c\nIndex \u201d and together the \u201c Indexes \u201d ). SSGA\nFunds Management, Inc. serves as the\ninvestment adviser for the Fund ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d\nor the \u201c Adviser \u201d ). The Fund offers and\nissues Shares at their net asset value\n(sometimes referred to herein as \u201c NAV \u201d )\nonly in aggregations of a specified number of\nShares (each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ). The Fund\ngenerally offers and issues Shares in exchange\nfor (i) a basket of securities designated by\nthe Fund ( \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d ) together\nwith the deposit of a specified cash payment (\n\u201c Cash Component \u201d ) or (ii) a cash payment\nequal in value to the Deposit Securities ( \u201c\nDeposit Cash \u201d ) together with the Cash\nComponent. The primary consideration accepted\nby the Fund (i.e., Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash) is set forth under \u201c Purchase\nand Redemption of Creation Units \u201d later in\nthis SAI. The Trust reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of a \u201c cash\nin lieu \u201d amount to be added to the Cash\nComponent to replace any Deposit Security and\nreserves the right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of\nDeposit Cash (subject to applicable legal\nrequirements). The Shares have been approved\nfor listing and secondary trading on a\nnational securities exchange (the \u201c Exchange \u201d\n). The Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nmarket prices. These prices may differ from\nthe Shares' net asset values. The Shares are\nalso redeemable only in Creation Unit\naggregations, and generally in exchange for\neither (i) portfolio securities and a\nspecified cash payment or (ii) cash (subject\nto applicable legal requirements). Shares may\nbe issued in advance of receipt of Deposit\nSecurities subject to various conditions\nincluding a requirement to maintain on deposit\nwith the Trust cash at least equal to a\nspecified percentage of the market value of\nthe missing Deposit Securities as set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement (as defined below).\nSee \u201c Purchase and Redemption of Creation\nUnits. \u201d The Trust may impose a transaction\nfee for each creation or redemption. In all\ncases, such fees will be limited in accordance\nwith the requirements of the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission ( \u201c SEC \u201d ) applicable\nto management investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. In addition to the\nfixed creation or redemption transaction fee,\nan additional transaction fee of up to three\ntimes the fixed creation or redemption\ntransaction fee and/or an additional variable\ncharge may apply. Investment Policies The Fund\nmay invest in the following types of\ninvestments, consistent with its investment\nstrategies and objective. Please see the\nFund's Prospectus for additional information\nregarding its principal investment strategies.\nDIVERSIFICATION STATUS The Fund is classified\nas a \u201c non-diversified \u201d investment company\nunder the 1940 Act. A \u201c non-diversified \u201d\nclassification means that the Fund is not\nlimited by the 1940 Act with regard to the\npercentage of its assets that may be invested\nin the securities of a single issuer. This\nmeans that the Fund may invest a greater\nportion of its assets in the securities of a\nsingle issuer than a diversified fund. The\nsecurities of a particular issuer may\nconstitute a greater portion of the Index and,\ntherefore, the securities may constitute a\ngreater portion of the Fund's portfolio. This\nmay have an adverse effect on the Fund's\nperformance or subject the Fund's Shares to\ngreater price volatility than more diversified\ninvestment companies. The Fund intends to\nmaintain the required level of diversification\nand otherwise conduct its operations so as to\nqualify as a \u201c regulated investment company \u201d\n( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c\nInternal Revenue Code \u201d ), and to relieve the\nFund of any liability for federal income tax\nto the extent that its earnings are\ndistributed to shareholders. Compliance with\nthe diversification requirements of the\nInternal Revenue Code may severely limit the\ninvestment flexibility of the Fund and may\nmake it less likely that the Fund will meet\nits investment objective. COMMERCIAL PAPER\nCommercial paper consists of short-term,\npromissory notes issued by banks, corporations\nand other entities to finance short-term\ncredit needs. These securities generally are\ndiscounted but sometimes may be interest\nbearing.\n\n3\n\nCOMMON STOCK Risks inherent in investing in\nequity securities include the risk that the\nfinancial condition of issuers may become\nimpaired or that the general condition of the\nstock market may deteriorate (either of which\nmay cause a decrease in the value of the\nFund's portfolio securities and therefore a\ndecrease in the value of Shares of the Fund).\nCommon stock is susceptible to general stock\nmarket fluctuation and to volatile increases\nand decreases in value as market confidence\nand perceptions change. These investor\nperceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors, including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies; inflation and interest rates;\neconomic expansion or contraction; and global\nor regional political, economic or banking\ncrises. Holders of common stock incur more\nrisk than holders of preferred stock and debt\nobligations because common stockholders, as\nowners of the issuer, have generally inferior\nrights to receive payments from the issuer in\ncomparison with the rights of creditors of, or\nholders of debt obligations or preferred stock\nissued by, the issuer. Further, unlike debt\nsecurities which typically have a stated\nprincipal amount payable at maturity (whose\nvalue, however, will be subject to market\nfluctuations prior thereto), or preferred\nstock which typically has a liquidation\npreference and which may have stated optional\nor mandatory redemption provisions, common\nstock has neither a fixed principal amount nor\na maturity. Common stock values are subject to\nmarket fluctuations as long as the common\nstock remains outstanding. CONCENTRATION The\nFund will concentrate its investments in\nsecurities of issuers in the same industry as\nmay be necessary to approximate the\ncomposition of the Fund's underlying Index.\nThe securities of issuers in particular\nindustries may dominate the benchmark Index of\nthe Fund and consequently the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio. This may adversely\naffect the Fund's performance or subject its\nShares to greater price volatility than that\nexperienced by less concentrated investment\ncompanies. The Trust's general policy is to\nexclude securities of the U.S. government and\nits agencies or instrumentalities when\nmeasuring industry concentration. In pursuing\nits objective, the Fund may hold the\nsecurities of a single issuer in an amount\nexceeding 10% of the market value of the\noutstanding securities of the issuer, subject\nto restrictions imposed by the Internal\nRevenue Code. In particular, as the Fund's\nsize grows and its assets increase, it will be\nmore likely to hold more than 10% of the\nsecurities of a single issuer if the issuer\nhas a relatively small public float as\ncompared to other components in its benchmark\nIndex. CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES Convertible\nsecurities are bonds, debentures, notes,\npreferred stock or other securities that may\nbe converted or exchanged (by the holder or by\nthe issuer) into shares of the underlying\ncommon stock (or cash or securities of\nequivalent value) at a stated exchange ratio.\nA convertible security may also be called for\nredemption or conversion by the issuer after a\nparticular date and under certain\ncircumstances (including a specified price)\nestablished upon issue. If a convertible\nsecurity held by the Fund is called for\nredemption or conversion, the Fund could be\nrequired to tender it for redemption, convert\nit into the underlying common stock, or sell\nit to a third party. Convertible securities\ngenerally have less potential for gain or loss\nthan common stock. Convertible securities\ngenerally provide yields higher than the\nunderlying common stock, but generally lower\nthan comparable non-convertible securities.\nBecause of this higher yield, convertible\nsecurities generally sell at a price above\ntheir \u201c conversion value, \u201d which is the\ncurrent market value of the stock to be\nreceived upon conversion. The difference\nbetween this conversion value and the price of\nconvertible securities will vary over time\ndepending on changes in the value of the\nunderlying common stock and interest rates.\nWhen the underlying common stock declines in\nvalue, convertible securities will tend not to\ndecline to the same extent because of the\ninterest or dividend payments and the\nrepayment of principal at maturity for certain\ntypes of convertible securities. However,\nsecurities that are convertible other than at\nthe option of the holder generally do not\nlimit the potential for loss to the same\nextent as securities convertible at the option\nof the holder. When the underlying common\nstock rises in value, the value of convertible\nsecurities may also be expected to increase.\nAt the same time, however, the difference\nbetween the market value of convertible\nsecurities and their conversion value will\nnarrow, which means that the value of\nconvertible securities will generally not\nincrease to the same extent as the value of\nthe underlying common stock. Because\nconvertible securities may also be interest-\nrate sensitive, their value may increase as\ninterest rates fall and decrease as interest\nrates rise. Convertible securities are also\nsubject to credit risk, and are often lower-\nquality securities.\n\n4\n\nEXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS The Fund may invest in\nother exchange-traded funds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d )\n(including ETFs managed by the Adviser). ETFs\nmay be structured as investment companies that\nare registered under the 1940 Act, typically\nas open-end funds or unit investment trusts.\nThese ETFs are generally based on specific\ndomestic and foreign market securities\nindices. An \u201c index-based ETF \u201d seeks to\nprovide investment results that match the\nperformance of an index by holding in its\nportfolio either the contents of the index or\na representative sample of the securities in\nthe index. An \u201c actively-managed ETF \u201d invests\nin securities based on an adviser's investment\nstrategy. An \u201c enhanced ETF \u201d seeks to provide\ninvestment results that match a positive or\nnegative multiple of the performance of an\nunderlying index. In seeking to provide such\nresults, an ETF and, in particular, an\nenhanced ETF, may engage in short sales of\nsecurities included in the underlying index\nand may invest in derivatives instruments,\nsuch as equity index swaps, futures contracts,\nand options on securities, futures contracts,\nand stock indices. Alternatively, ETFs may be\nstructured as grantor trusts or other forms of\npooled investment vehicles that are not\nregistered or regulated under the 1940 Act.\nThese ETFs typically hold commodities,\nprecious metals, currency or other non-\nsecurities investments. ETFs, like mutual\nfunds, have expenses associated with their\noperation, such as advisory and custody fees.\nWhen the Fund invests in an ETF, in addition\nto directly bearing expenses associated with\nits own operations, including the brokerage\ncosts associated with the purchase and sale of\nshares of the ETF, the Fund will bear a pro\nrata portion of the ETF's expenses. In\naddition, it may be more costly to own an ETF\nthan to directly own the securities or other\ninvestments held by the ETF because of ETF\nexpenses. The risks of owning shares of an ETF\ngenerally reflect the risks of owning the\nunderlying securities or other investments\nheld by the ETF, although lack of liquidity in\nthe market for the shares of an ETF could\nresult in the ETF's value being more volatile\nthan the underlying securities or other\ninvestments. FUTURES CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND\nSWAP AGREEMENTS The Fund may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in derivatives, including\nexchange-traded futures on indices, exchange-\ntraded futures on Treasuries or Eurodollars,\nU.S. exchange-traded or OTC put and call\noptions contracts and exchange-traded or OTC\nswap transactions (including NDFs, interest\nrate swaps, total return swaps, excess return\nswaps, and credit default swaps). Futures and\nOptions on Futures: Futures contracts\ngenerally provide for the future sale by one\nparty and purchase by another party of a\nspecified commodity or security at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Index\nfutures contracts are settled daily with a\npayment by one party to the other of a cash\namount based on the difference between the\nlevel of the index specified in the contract\nfrom one day to the next. A futures contract\non an index is an agreement pursuant to which\ntwo parties agree to take or make delivery of\nan amount of cash equal to the difference\nbetween the value of the index at the close of\nthe last trading day of the contract and the\nprice at which the index contract originally\nwas written. Although the value of an index\nmight be a function of the value of certain\nspecified securities, physical delivery of\nthese securities is not always made. A public\nmarket exists in futures contracts covering a\nnumber of indexes, as well as financial\ninstruments, including, without limitation:\nU.S. Treasury bonds; U.S. Treasury notes; GNMA\nCertificates; three-month U.S. Treasury bills;\n90-day commercial paper; bank certificates of\ndeposit; Eurodollar certificates of deposit;\nthe Australian Dollar; the Canadian Dollar;\nthe British Pound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss\nFranc; the Mexican Peso; and certain\nmultinational currencies, such as the Euro. It\nis expected that other futures contracts will\nbe developed and traded in the future. Futures\ncontracts are standardized as to maturity date\nand underlying instrument and are traded on\nfutures exchanges. The Fund may purchase and\nwrite (sell) call and put options on futures.\nOptions on futures give the holder the right,\nin return for the premium paid, to assume a\nlong position (call) or short position (put)\nin a futures contract at a specified exercise\nprice upon expiration of, or at any time\nduring the period of, the option. Upon\nexercise of a call option, the holder acquires\na long position in the futures contract and\nthe writer is assigned the opposite short\nposition. In the case of a put option, the\nopposite is true. The Fund is required to make\na good faith margin deposit in cash or U.S.\ngovernment securities (or other eligible\ncollateral) with a broker or custodian to\ninitiate and maintain open positions in\nfutures contracts. A margin deposit is\nintended to assure completion of the contract\n(delivery or acceptance of the underlying\ncommodity or payment of the cash settlement\namount) if it is not terminated prior to the\nspecified delivery date. Brokers may establish\ndeposit requirements which are higher than the\nexchange minimums. Futures contracts are\ncustomarily purchased and sold on margin\ndeposits which may range upward from less than\n5% of the value of the contract being traded.\n\n5\n\nAfter a futures contract position is opened,\nthe value of the contract is marked to market\ndaily. If the futures contract price changes\nto the extent that the margin on deposit does\nnot satisfy price changes, additional payments\nwill be required. Conversely, change in the\ncontract value may reduce the required margin,\nresulting in a repayment of excess margin to\nthe contract holder. Variation margin payments\nare made to and from the futures broker for as\nlong as the contract remains open. In such\ncase, the Fund would expect to earn interest\nincome on its margin deposits. Although some\nfutures contracts call for making or taking\ndelivery of the underlying commodity,\ngenerally these obligations are closed out\nprior to delivery by offsetting purchases or\nsales of matching futures contracts (involving\nthe same exchange, underlying commodity,\nsecurity or index and delivery month). If an\noffsetting purchase price is less than the\noriginal sale price, the Fund realizes a\ncapital gain, or if it is more, the Fund\nrealizes a capital loss. Conversely, if an\noffsetting sale price is more than the\noriginal purchase price, the Fund realizes a\ncapital gain, or if it is less, the Fund\nrealizes a capital loss. The transaction costs\nalso must be included in these calculations.\nOptions: The Fund may purchase and sell put\nand call options. Such options may relate to\nparticular securities and may or may not be\nlisted on a national securities exchange and\nissued by the Options Clearing Corporation.\nOptions trading is a highly specialized\nactivity that entails greater than ordinary\ninvestment risk. Options on particular\nsecurities may be more volatile than the\nunderlying securities, and therefore, on a\npercentage basis, an investment in options may\nbe subject to greater fluctuation than an\ninvestment in the underlying securities\nthemselves. Short Sales \u201c Against the Box \u201d :\nThe Fund may engage in short sales \u201c against\nthe box. \u201d In a short sale against the box,\nthe Fund agrees to sell at a future date a\nsecurity that it either contemporaneously owns\nor has the right to acquire at no extra cost.\nIf the price of the security has declined at\nthe time the Fund is required to deliver the\nsecurity, the Fund will benefit from the\ndifference in the price. If the price of the\nsecurity has increased, the Fund will be\nrequired to pay the difference. Swap\nTransactions: The Fund may enter into swap\ntransactions, including interest rate swap,\ncredit default swap, NDF, and total return\nswap transactions. Swap transactions are\ncontracts between parties in which one party\nagrees to make periodic payments to the other\nparty based on the change in market value or\nlevel of a specified rate, index or asset. In\nreturn, the other party agrees to make\npayments to the first party based on the\nreturn of a different specified rate, index or\nasset. Swap transactions will usually be done\non a net basis, i.e., where the two parties\nmake net payments with the Fund receiving or\npaying, as the case may be, only the net\namount of the two payments. The net amount of\nthe excess, if any, of the Fund's obligations\nover its entitlements with respect to each\nswap is accrued on a daily basis and an amount\nof cash or equivalents having an aggregate\nvalue at least equal to the accrued excess is\nmaintained by the Fund. Swaps may be used in\nconjunction with other instruments to offset\ninterest rate, currency or other underlying\nrisks. For example, interest rate swaps may be\noffset with \u201c caps, \u201d \u201c floors \u201d or \u201c collars.\n\u201d A \u201c cap \u201d is essentially a call option which\nplaces a limit on the amount of floating rate\ninterest that must be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u201c floor \u201d is essentially a\nput option which places a limit on the minimum\namount that would be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u201c collar \u201d is essentially\na combination of a long cap and a short floor\nwhere the limits are set at different levels.\nThe use of swap transactions by the Fund\nentails certain risks, which may be different\nfrom, or possibly greater than, the risks\nassociated with investing directly in the\nsecurities and other investments that are the\nreferenced asset for the swap agreement. Swaps\nare highly specialized instruments that\nrequire investment techniques, risk analyses,\nand tax planning different from those\nassociated with stocks, bonds, and other\ntraditional investments. The use of a swap\nrequires an understanding not only of the\nreferenced asset, reference rate, or index,\nbut also of the swap itself, without the\nbenefit of observing the performance of the\nswap under all the possible market conditions.\nBecause some swap transactions have a leverage\ncomponent, adverse changes in the value or\nlevel of the underlying asset, reference rate,\nor index can result in a loss substantially\ngreater than the amount invested in the swap\nitself. Certain swaps have the potential for\nunlimited loss, regardless of the size of the\ninitial investment. Bilateral OTC transactions\ndiffer from exchange-traded or cleared\nderivatives transactions in several respects.\nBilateral OTC transactions are transacted\ndirectly with dealers and not with a clearing\ncorporation. Without the availability of a\nclearing corporation, bilateral OTC\ntransaction pricing is normally done by\nreference to information from market makers\nand/or available index data, which information\nis carefully monitored by the Adviser and\nverified in appropriate cases. As bilateral\nOTC transactions are entered into directly\nwith a dealer, there is a risk of\nnonperformance by the dealer as a result of\nits insolvency or otherwise. Under regulations\nadopted by the CFTC and federal banking\nregulators ( \u201c Margin Rules \u201d ), the Fund is\nrequired to post collateral (known as\nvariation margin) to cover the mark-to-market\nexposure in respect of its uncleared swaps.\nThe Margin Rules also mandate that collateral\nin the form of initial margin be posted to\n\n6\n\ncover potential future exposure attributable\nto uncleared swap transactions. In the event\nthe Fund is required to post collateral in the\nform of initial margin or variation margin in\nrespect of its uncleared swap transactions,\nall such collateral will be posted with a\nthird party custodian pursuant to a triparty\ncustody agreement between the Fund, its dealer\ncounterparty and an unaffiliated custodian.\nThe requirement to execute certain OTC\nderivatives contracts on exchanges or\nelectronic trading platforms called swap\nexecution facilities ( \u201c SEFs \u201d ) may offer\ncertain advantages over traditional bilateral\nOTC trading, such as ease of execution, price\ntransparency, increased liquidity and/or\nfavorable pricing. However, SEF trading may\nmake it more difficult and costly for the Fund\nto enter into highly tailored or customized\ntransactions and may result in additional\ncosts and risks. Market participants such as\nthe Fund that execute derivatives contracts\nthrough a SEF, whether directly or through a\nbroker intermediary, are required to submit to\nthe jurisdiction of the SEF and comply with\nSEF and CFTC rules and regulations which\nimpose, among other things disclosure and\nrecordkeeping obligations. In addition, the\nFund will generally incur SEF or broker\nintermediary fees when it trades on a SEF. The\nFund may also be required to indemnify the SEF\nor broker intermediary for any losses or costs\nthat may result from the Fund's transactions\non the SEF. Total Return Swaps: The Fund may\nenter into total return swap transactions for\ninvestment purposes. Total return swaps are\ntransactions in which one party agrees to make\nperiodic payments based on the change in\nmarket value of the underlying assets, which\nmay include a specified security, basket of\nsecurities or security indexes during the\nspecified period, in return for periodic\npayments based on a fixed or variable interest\nrate of the total return from other underlying\nassets. Total return swaps may be used to\nobtain exposure to a security or market\nwithout owning or taking physical custody of\nsuch security or market, including in cases in\nwhich there may be disadvantages associated\nwith direct ownership of a particular\nsecurity. In a typical total return equity\nswap, payments made by the Fund or the\ncounterparty are based on the total return of\na particular reference asset or assets (such\nas an equity security, a combination of such\nsecurities, or an index). That is, one party\nagrees to pay another party the return on a\nstock, basket of stocks, or stock index in\nreturn for a specified interest rate. By\nentering into an equity index swap, for\nexample, the index receiver can gain exposure\nto stocks making up the index of securities\nwithout actually purchasing those stocks.\nTotal return swaps involve not only the risk\nassociated with the investment in the\nunderlying securities, but also the risk of\nthe counterparty not fulfilling its\nobligations under the agreement. Credit\nDefault Swaps: The Fund may enter into credit\ndefault swap transactions for investment\npurposes. A credit default swap transaction\nmay have as reference obligations one or more\nsecurities that are not currently held by the\nFund. The Fund may be either the protection\nbuyer or protection seller in the transaction.\nCredit default swaps may also be structured\nbased on the debt of a basket of issuers,\nrather than a single issuer, and may be\ncustomized with respect to the default event\nthat triggers purchase or other factors. As a\nprotection seller, the Fund would generally\nreceive an upfront payment or a fixed rate of\nincome throughout the term of the swap, which\ntypically is between six months and three\nyears, provided that there is no credit event.\nIf a credit event occurs, generally the\nprotection seller must pay the protection\nbuyer the full face amount of the reference\nobligations that may have little or no value.\nIf the Fund were a protection buyer and no\ncredit event occurred during the term of the\nswap, the Fund would recover nothing if the\nswap were held through its termination date.\nHowever, if a credit event occurred, the\nprotection buyer may elect to receive the full\nnotional value of the swap in exchange for an\nequal face amount of the reference obligation\nthat may have little or no value. Where the\nFund is the protection buyer, credit default\nswaps involve the risk that the seller may\nfail to satisfy its payment obligations to the\nFund in the event of a default. The purchase\nof credit default swaps involves costs, which\nwill reduce the Fund's return. Currency Swaps:\nThe Fund may enter into currency swap\ntransactions for investment purposes. Currency\nswaps are similar to interest rate swaps,\nexcept that they involve multiple currencies.\nThe Fund may enter into a currency swap when\nit has exposure to one currency and desires\nexposure to a different currency. Typically,\nthe interest rates that determine the currency\nswap payments are fixed, although occasionally\none or both parties may pay a floating rate of\ninterest. Unlike an interest rate swap,\nhowever, the principal amounts are exchanged\nat the beginning of the contract and returned\nat the end of the contract. In addition to\npaying and receiving amounts at the beginning\nand end of the transaction, both sides will\nhave to pay in full on a periodic basis based\nupon the currency they have borrowed. Change\nin foreign exchange rates and changes in\ninterest rates, as described above, may\nnegatively affect currency swaps. Interest\nRate Swaps: The Fund may enter into an\ninterest rate swap in an effort to protect\nagainst declines in the value of fixed income\nsecurities held by the Fund. In such an\ninstance, the Fund may agree to pay a fixed\nrate (multiplied by a notional amount) while a\ncounterparty agrees to pay a floating rate\n(multiplied by the same notional amount). If\ninterest rates rise, resulting in a diminution\nin the value of the Fund's portfolio, the Fund\nwould receive payments under the swap that\nwould offset, in whole or in part, such\ndiminution in value.\n\n7\n\nOptions on Swaps: An option on a swap\nagreement, or a \u201c swaption, \u201d is a contract\nthat gives a counterparty the right (but not\nthe obligation) to enter into a new swap\nagreement or to shorten, extend, cancel or\notherwise modify an existing swap agreement,\nat some designated future time on specified\nterms. In return, the purchaser pays a \u201c\npremium \u201d to the seller of the contract. The\nseller of the contract receives the premium\nand bears the risk of unfavorable changes on\nthe underlying swap. The Fund may write (sell)\nand purchase put and call swaptions. The Fund\nmay also enter into swaptions on either an\nasset-based or liability-based basis,\ndepending on whether the Fund is hedging its\nassets or its liabilities. The Fund may write\n(sell) and purchase put and call swaptions to\nthe same extent it may make use of standard\noptions on securities or other instruments.\nThe Fund may enter into these transactions\nprimarily to preserve a return or spread on a\nparticular investment or portion of its\nholdings, as a duration management technique,\nto protect against an increase in the price of\nsecurities the Fund anticipates purchasing at\na later date, or for any other purposes, such\nas for speculation to increase returns.\nSwaptions are generally subject to the same\nrisks involved in the Fund's use of options.\nDepending on the terms of the particular\noption agreement, the Fund will generally\nincur a greater degree of risk when it writes\na swaption than it will incur when it\npurchases a swaption. When the Fund purchases\na swaption, it risks losing only the amount of\nthe premium it has paid should it decide to\nlet the option expire unexercised. However,\nwhen the Fund writes a swaption, upon exercise\nof the option the Fund will become obligated\naccording to the terms of the underlying\nagreement. Government Regulation: The Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (the \u201c Dodd-Frank Act \u201d ) that\nwas signed into law on July 21, 2010 created a\nnew statutory framework that comprehensively\nregulated the over-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d )\nderivatives markets for the first time. Prior\nto the Dodd-Frank Act, the OTC derivatives\nmarkets were traditionally traded on a\nbilateral basis (so-called \u201c bilateral OTC\ntransactions \u201d ). Under the Dodd-Frank Act,\ncertain OTC derivatives transactions are now\nrequired to be centrally cleared and traded on\nSEFs. On October 28, 2020, the SEC adopted\nRule 18f-4 (the \u201c Derivatives Rule \u201d ) under\nthe 1940 Act which replaced prior SEC and\nstaff guidance with an updated, comprehensive\nframework for registered funds' use of\nderivatives. The Derivatives Rule permits the\nFund to enter into derivatives transactions\nand certain other transactions notwithstanding\nthe restrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior\nsecurities \u201d under Section 18 of the 1940 Act.\nThe Derivatives Rule requires the Fund to\ntrade derivatives and certain other\ninstruments that create future payment or\ndelivery obligations subject to a value-at-\nrisk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ) leverage limit, develop and\nimplement a derivatives risk management\nprogram and new testing requirements, and\ncomply with new requirements related to board\nand SEC reporting. These requirements apply\nunless the Fund qualifies as a \u201c limited\nderivatives user, \u201d as defined in the\nDerivatives Rule. Complying with the\nDerivatives Rule may increase the cost of the\nFund's investments and cost of doing business,\nwhich could adversely affect investors. Other\nnew regulations could adversely affect the\nvalue, availability and performance of certain\nderivative instruments, may make them more\ncostly, and may limit or restrict their use by\nthe Fund. Regulation Under the Commodity\nExchange Act: The Fund intends to use\ncommodity interests, such as futures, swaps\nand options on futures in accordance with Rule\n4.5 of the CEA. The Fund may use exchange-\ntraded futures and options on futures,\ntogether with positions in cash and money\nmarket instruments, to simulate full\ninvestment in its underlying Index. Exchange-\ntraded futures and options on futures\ncontracts may not be currently available for\nan Index. Under such circumstances, the\nAdviser may seek to utilize other instruments\nthat it believes to be correlated to the\napplicable Index components or a subset of the\ncomponents. An exclusion from the definition\nof the term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d has\nbeen claimed with respect to each series of\nthe Trust in accordance with Rule 4.5 such\nthat registration or regulation as a commodity\npool operator under the CEA is not necessary.\nRestrictions on Trading in Commodity\nInterests: The Fund reserves the right to\nengage in transactions involving futures,\noptions thereon and swaps to the extent\nallowed by the CFTC regulations in effect from\ntime to time and in accordance with the Fund's\npolicies. Certain additional risk factors\nrelated to derivatives are discussed below:\nDerivatives Risk: Under recently adopted rules\nby the CFTC, transactions in some types of\ninterest rate swaps and index credit default\nswaps on North American and European indices\nare required to be cleared. In addition, the\nCFTC may promulgate additional regulations\nthat require clearing of other classes of\nswaps. In a cleared derivatives transaction\n(which includes futures, options on futures,\nand cleared swaps transactions), the Fund's\ncounterparty is a clearing house (such as CME,\nICE Clear Credit or LCH.Clearnet), rather than\na bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a\nmember of a clearing house and only members of\na clearing house can participate directly in\nthe clearing house, the Fund holds cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers, who are futures commission merchants\nthat are members of the clearing houses and\nwho have the appropriate regulatory\n\n8\n\napprovals to engage in cleared derivatives\ntransactions. The Fund makes and receives\npayments owed under cleared derivatives\ntransactions (including margin payments)\nthrough its accounts at clearing members.\nClearing members guarantee performance of\ntheir clients' obligations to the clearing\nhouse. In contrast to bilateral OTC\ntransactions, clearing members generally can\nrequire termination of existing cleared\nderivatives transactions at any time and\nincreases in margin above the margin that it\nrequired at the beginning of a transaction.\nClearing houses also have broad rights to\nincrease margin requirements for existing\ntransactions and to terminate transactions in\naccordance with their rules. Any such increase\nor termination could interfere with the\nability of the Fund to pursue its investment\nstrategy. Also, the Fund is subject to\nexecution risk if it enters into a derivatives\ntransaction that is required to be cleared (or\nthat the Advisor expects to be cleared), and\nno clearing member is willing or able to clear\nthe transaction on the Fund's behalf. While\nthe documentation in place between the Fund\nand its clearing members generally provides\nthat the clearing members will accept for\nclearing all transactions submitted for\nclearing that are within credit limits\nspecified by the clearing members in advance,\nthe Fund could be subject to this execution\nrisk if the Fund submits for clearing\ntransactions that exceed such credit limits,\nif the clearing house does not accept the\ntransactions for clearing, or if the clearing\nmembers do not comply with their agreement to\nclear such transactions. In that case, the\ntransaction might have to be terminated, and\nthe Fund could lose some or all of the benefit\nof any increase in the value of the\ntransaction after the time of the transaction.\nIn addition, new regulations could, among\nother things, restrict the Fund's ability to\nengage in, or increase the cost to the Fund\nof, derivatives transactions, for example, by\nmaking some types of derivatives no longer\navailable to the Fund or increasing margin or\ncapital requirements. If the Fund is not able\nto enter into a particular derivatives\ntransaction, the Fund's investment performance\nand risk profile could be adversely affected\nas a result. Counterparty Risk: Counterparty\nrisk with respect to OTC derivatives may be\naffected by new regulations promulgated by the\nCFTC and SEC affecting the derivatives market.\nAs described under \u201c Derivatives Risk \u201d above,\nall futures and options on futures and some\nswap transactions are required to be cleared,\nand a party to a cleared derivatives\ntransaction is subject to the credit risk of\nthe clearing house and the clearing member\nthrough which it holds its cleared derivatives\nposition, rather than the credit risk of its\noriginal counterparty to the derivative\ntransaction. Clearing members are required to\nsegregate all funds received from customers\nwith respect to cleared derivatives\ntransactions from the clearing member's\nproprietary assets. However, all funds and\nother property received by a clearing broker\nfrom its customers are generally held by the\nclearing broker on a commingled basis in an\nomnibus account, and the clearing broker may\nalso invest those funds in certain instruments\npermitted under the applicable regulations.\nAlso, the clearing member transfers to the\nclearing house the amount of margin required\nby the clearing house for cleared derivatives\ntransactions, which amounts are generally held\nin the relevant omnibus account at the\nclearing house for all customers of the\nclearing member. For commodities futures\npositions, the clearing house may use all of\nthe collateral held in the clearing member's\nomnibus account to meet a loss in that\naccount, without regard to which customer in\nfact supplied that collateral. Accordingly, in\naddition to bearing the credit risk of its\nclearing member, each customer to a futures\ntransaction also bears \u201c fellow customer \u201d\nrisk from other customers of the clearing\nmember. However, with respect to cleared swaps\npositions, recent regulations promulgated by\nthe CFTC require that the clearing member\nnotify the clearing house of the amount of\ninitial margin provided by the clearing member\nto the clearing house that is attributable to\neach customer. Because margin in respect of\ncleared swaps must be earmarked for specific\nclearing member customers, the clearing house\nmay not use the collateral of one customer to\ncover the obligations of another customer.\nHowever, if the clearing member does not\nprovide accurate reporting, the Fund is\nsubject to the risk that a clearing house will\nuse the Fund's assets held in an omnibus\naccount at the clearing house to satisfy\npayment obligations of a defaulting customer\nof the clearing member to the clearing house.\nIn addition, clearing members may generally\nchoose to provide to the clearing house the\nnet amount of variation margin required for\ncleared swaps for all of its customers in the\naggregate, rather than the gross amount for\neach customer. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The Fund\nmay take advantage of opportunities in the\narea of options and futures contracts, options\non futures contracts, warrants, swaps and any\nother investments which are not presently\ncontemplated for use by the Fund or which are\nnot currently available but which may be\ndeveloped, to the extent such opportunities\nare both consistent with the Fund's investment\nobjective and legally permissible for the\nFund. Before entering into such transactions\nor making any such investment, the Fund will\nprovide appropriate disclosure.\n\n9\n\nILLIQUID INVESTMENTS The Fund may invest in\nilliquid investments. The Fund may not acquire\nany illiquid investment if, immediately after\nthe acquisition, the Fund would have invested\nmore than 15% of its net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid investment means any\ninvestment that the Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without the sale or disposition\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. If illiquid investments exceed 15%\nof the Fund's net assets, certain remedial\nactions will be taken as required by Rule\n22e-4 under the 1940 Act and the Fund's\npolicies and procedures. INVESTMENT COMPANIES\nThe Fund may invest in the securities of other\ninvestment companies, including affiliated\nfunds and money market funds, subject to\napplicable limitations under Section 12(d)(1)\nof the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Section 12(d)(1),\nthe Fund may invest in the securities of\nanother investment company (the \u201c acquired\ncompany \u201d ) provided that the Fund,\nimmediately after such purchase or\nacquisition, does not own in the aggregate:\n(i) more than 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the acquired company; (ii)\nsecurities issued by the acquired company\nhaving an aggregate value in excess of 5% of\nthe value of the total assets of the Fund; or\n(iii) securities issued by the acquired\ncompany and all other investment companies\n(other than Treasury stock of the Fund) having\nan aggregate value in excess of 10% of the\nvalue of the total assets of the Fund. To the\nextent allowed by law, regulation, and/or the\nFund's investment restrictions, the Fund may\ninvest its assets in securities of investment\ncompanies, including affiliated funds and/or\nmoney market funds, in excess of the limits\ndiscussed above. If the Fund invests in and,\nthus, is a shareholder of, another investment\ncompany, the Fund's shareholders will\nindirectly bear the Fund's proportionate share\nof the fees and expenses paid by such other\ninvestment company, including advisory fees,\nin addition to both the management fees\npayable directly by the Fund to the Fund's own\ninvestment adviser and the other expenses that\nthe Fund bears directly in connection with the\nFund's own operations. INVESTMENTS IN VARIABLE\nINTEREST ENTITY STRUCTURES The Fund may gain\ninvestment exposure to certain Chinese\ncompanies through variable interest entity ( \u201c\nVIE \u201d ) structures. Such investments are\nsubject to the investment risks associated\nwith the Chinese-based company. The VIE\nstructure enables foreign investors, such as\nthe Fund, to obtain investment exposure to a\nChinese company in situations in which the\nChinese government has limited or prohibited\nnon-Chinese ownership of such company. The VIE\nstructure does not involve direct equity\nownership in a China-based company, but rather\ninvolves claims to the China-based company's\nprofits and control of the assets that belong\nto the China-based company through contractual\narrangements. The contractual arrangements in\nplace with the China-based company provide\nlimited ability to exercise control over the\nChina-based company and the China-based\ncompany's actions may negatively impact the\nvalue of an investment through a VIE\nstructure. Control may also be jeopardized if\na natural person who holds an equity interest\nin the China-based company breaches the terms\nof the contractual arrangements or is subject\nto legal proceedings, or if any physical\ninstruments such as chops and seals are used\nwithout authorization. Intervention by the\nChinese government with respect to the VIE\nstructure could significantly affect the\nChinese operating company's performance and\nthus, the value of the Fund's investment\nthrough a VIE structure, as well as the\nenforceability of the contractual arrangements\nof the VIE structure. In the event of such an\noccurrence, the Fund, as a foreign investor,\nmay have little or no legal recourse. If the\nChinese government were to determine that the\ncontractual arrangements establishing the VIE\nstructure did not comply with Chinese law or\nregulations, the Chinese operating company\ncould be subject to penalties, revocation of\nits business and operating license, or\nforfeiture of ownership interests. In addition\nto the risk of government intervention,\ninvestments through a VIE structure are\nsubject to the risk that the China-based\ncompany (or its officers, directors, or\nChinese equity owners) may breach the\ncontractual arrangements, or Chinese law\nchanges in a way that adversely affects the\nenforceability of the arrangements, or the\ncontracts are otherwise not enforceable under\nChinese law, in which case the Fund may suffer\nsignificant losses on its investments through\na VIE structure with little or no recourse\navailable. LENDING PORTFOLIO SECURITIES The\nFund may lend portfolio securities to certain\ncreditworthy borrowers in U.S. and non-U.S.\nmarkets in an amount not to exceed 40% of the\nvalue of its net assets. The borrowers provide\ncollateral that is marked to market daily in\nan amount at least equal to the current market\nvalue of the securities loaned. The Fund may\nterminate a loan at any time and obtain the\nsecurities loaned. The Fund receives the value\nof any interest or cash or non-cash\ndistributions paid on the loaned\n\n10\n\nsecurities. The Fund cannot vote proxies for\nsecurities on loan, but may recall loans to\nvote proxies if a material issue affecting the\nFund's economic interest in the investment is\nto be voted upon. Efforts to recall such\nsecurities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly\ntraded securities. Distributions received on\nloaned securities in lieu of dividend payments\n(i.e., substitute payments) would not be\nconsidered qualified dividend income. With\nrespect to loans that are collateralized by\ncash, the borrower will be entitled to receive\na fee based on the amount of cash collateral.\nThe Fund is compensated by the difference\nbetween the amount earned on the reinvestment\nof cash collateral and the fee paid to the\nborrower. In the case of collateral other than\ncash, the Fund is compensated by a fee paid by\nthe borrower equal to a percentage of the\nmarket value of the loaned securities. Any\ncash collateral may be reinvested in certain\nhigh quality short-term instruments either\ndirectly on behalf of the lending Fund or\nthrough one or more joint accounts or funds,\nwhich may include those managed by the\nAdviser. The Fund could lose money due to a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or any investments made\nwith cash collateral. Certain non-cash\ncollateral or investments made with cash\ncollateral may have a greater risk of loss\nthan other non-cash collateral or investments.\nThe Fund may pay a portion of the interest or\nfees earned from securities lending to a\nborrower as described above, and to one or\nmore securities lending agents approved by the\nBoard of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201c Board \u201d\n) who administer the lending program for the\nFund in accordance with guidelines approved by\nthe Board. In such capacity, the lending agent\nprovides the following services to the Fund in\nconnection with the Fund's securities lending\nactivities: (i) locating borrowers among an\napproved list of prospective borrowers; (ii)\ncausing the delivery of loaned securities from\nthe Fund to borrowers; (iii) monitoring the\nvalue of loaned securities, the value of\ncollateral received, and other lending\nparameters; (iv) seeking additional\ncollateral, as necessary, from borrowers; (v)\nreceiving and holding collateral from\nborrowers, and facilitating the investment and\nreinvestment of all or substantially all cash\ncollateral in an investment vehicle designated\nby the Fund; (vi) returning collateral to\nborrowers; (vii) facilitating substitute\ndividend, interest, and other distribution\npayments to the Fund from borrowers; (viii)\nnegotiating the terms of each loan of\nsecurities, including but not limited to the\namount of any loan premium, and monitoring the\nterms of securities loan agreements with\nprospective borrowers for consistency with the\nrequirements of the Fund's Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement; (ix) selecting\nsecurities, including amounts (percentages),\nto be loaned; (x) recordkeeping and accounting\nservicing; and (xi) arranging for return of\nloaned securities to the Fund in accordance\nwith the terms of the Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement. State Street Bank and\nTrust Company ( \u201c State Street \u201d ), an\naffiliate of the Trust, has been approved by\nthe Board to serve as securities lending agent\nfor the Fund and the Trust has entered into an\nagreement with State Street for such services.\nAmong other matters, the Trust has agreed to\nindemnify State Street for certain\nliabilities. State Street has received an\norder of exemption from the SEC under Sections\n17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the 1940 Act to serve\nas the lending agent for affiliated investment\ncompanies such as the Trust and to invest the\ncash collateral received from loan\ntransactions to be invested in an affiliated\ncash collateral fund. Securities lending\ninvolves exposure to certain risks, including\noperational risk (i.e., the risk of losses\nresulting from problems in the settlement and\naccounting process especially so in certain\ninternational markets such as Taiwan), \u201c gap \u201d\nrisk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the\nreturn on cash collateral reinvestments and\nthe fees the Fund has agreed to pay a\nborrower), risk of loss of collateral, credit,\nlegal, counterparty and market risk. If a\nsecurities lending counterparty were to\ndefault, the Fund would be subject to the risk\nof a possible delay in receiving collateral or\nin recovering the loaned securities, or to a\npossible loss of rights in the collateral. In\nthe event a borrower does not return the\nFund's securities as agreed, the Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs incurred in purchasing\nreplacement securities. Although State Street\nhas agreed to provide the Fund with\nindemnification in the event of a borrower\ndefault, the Fund is still exposed to the risk\nof losses in the event a borrower does not\nreturn the Fund's securities as agreed. For\nexample, delays in recovery of lent securities\nmay cause the Fund to lose the opportunity to\nsell the securities at a desirable price.\nLEVERAGING While the Fund does not anticipate\ndoing so, the Fund may borrow money in an\namount greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund's total assets. However, under normal\ncircumstances, the Fund will not borrow money\nfrom a bank in an amount greater than 10% of\nthe value of the Fund's total assets.\nBorrowing for investment purposes is one form\nof leverage. Leveraging investments, by\npurchasing securities with borrowed money, is\na speculative technique that increases\ninvestment risk, but also increases investment\nopportunity. Because substantially all of the\nFund's assets will fluctuate in value, whereas\nthe interest obligations on borrowings may be\nfixed, the NAV of the Fund will increase more\nwhen such\n\n11\n\nFund's portfolio assets increase in value and\ndecrease more when the Fund's portfolio assets\ndecrease in value than would otherwise be the\ncase. Moreover, interest costs on borrowings\nmay fluctuate with changing market rates of\ninterest and may partially offset or exceed\nthe returns on the borrowed funds. OTHER\nSHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS The Fund may invest in\nshort-term instruments, including money market\ninstruments, (including money market funds\nadvised by the Adviser), cash and cash\nequivalents, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by the Adviser); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c\nCDs \u201d ), bankers' acceptances, fixed time\ndeposits and other obligations of U.S. and\nforeign banks (including foreign branches) and\nsimilar institutions; (iv) commercial paper\nrated at the date of purchase \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by\nMoody's Investors Service ( \u201c Moody's \u201d ) or \u201c\nA-1 \u201d by S&P Global Ratings ( \u201c S&P \u201d ), or if\nunrated, of comparable quality as determined\nby the Adviser; (v) non-convertible corporate\ndebt securities (e.g., bonds and debentures)\nwith remaining maturities at the date of\npurchase of not more than 397 days and that\npresent minimal credit risk; and (vi) short-\nterm U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of\nforeign banks (including U.S. branches) that,\nin the opinion of the Adviser, are of\ncomparable quality to obligations of U.S.\nbanks which may be purchased by the Fund. Any\nof these instruments may be purchased on a\ncurrent or a forward-settled basis. Time\ndeposits are non-negotiable deposits\nmaintained in banking institutions for\nspecified periods of time at stated interest\nrates. Bankers' acceptances are time drafts\ndrawn on commercial banks by borrowers,\nusually in connection with international\ntransactions. Money market instruments also\ninclude shares of money market funds. The SEC\nand other government agencies continue to\nreview the regulation of money market funds.\nThe SEC has adopted changes to the rules that\ngovern money market funds, and compliance with\nmany of these amendments was required in\nOctober 2016. Legislative developments may\nalso affect money market funds. These changes\nand developments may affect the investment\nstrategies, performance, yield, operating\nexpenses and continued viability of a money\nmarket fund. PREFERRED SECURITIES Preferred\nsecurities pay fixed or adjustable rate\ninterest or dividends to investors, and are\ngenerally senior to common stock, but may be\nsubordinated to bonds and other debt\ninstruments in a company's capital structure\nand therefore may be subject to greater credit\nrisk than those debt instruments. There is no\nassurance that interest payments, dividends or\ndistributions on the preferred securities in\nwhich the Fund invests will be declared or\notherwise made payable. In the case of\npreferred stock, in order to be payable,\ndistributions on preferred securities must be\ndeclared by the issuer's board of directors.\nThe market value of preferred securities may\nbe affected by favorable and unfavorable\nchanges impacting companies in the utilities\nand financial services sectors, which are\nprominent issuers of preferred securities, and\nby actual and anticipated changes in tax laws.\nBecause the claim on an issuer's earnings\nrepresented by preferred securities may become\nonerous when interest rates fall below the\nrate payable on such securities, the issuer\nmay redeem the securities. Thus, in declining\ninterest rate environments in particular, the\nFund's holdings of higher rate-paying fixed\nrate preferred securities may be reduced and\nthe Fund would be unable to acquire securities\npaying comparable rates with the redemption\nproceeds. PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND RESTRICTED\nSECURITIES The Fund may invest in securities\nthat are purchased in private placements and,\naccordingly, are subject to restrictions on\nresale as a matter of contract or under\nfederal securities laws. While such private\nplacements may offer attractive opportunities\nfor investment not otherwise available on the\nopen market, the securities so purchased are\noften \u201c restricted securities, \u201d i.e.,\nsecurities which cannot be sold to the public\nwithout registration under the Securities Act\nor the availability of an exemption from\nregistration (such as Rules 144 or 144A), or\nwhich are not readily marketable because they\nare subject to other legal or contractual\ndelays in or restrictions on resale. Generally\nspeaking, restricted securities may be sold\nonly to qualified institutional buyers, or in\na privately negotiated transaction to a\nlimited number of purchasers, or in limited\nquantities after they have been held for a\nspecified period of time and other conditions\nare met pursuant to an exemption from\nregistration, or in a public offering for\nwhich a registration statement is in effect\nunder the Securities Act. Because there may be\nrelatively few potential purchasers for such\ninvestments, especially under adverse market\nor economic conditions or in the event of\nadverse changes in the financial condition of\nthe issuer, the Fund could find it more\ndifficult to sell such securities when the\nAdviser believes it advisable to do so or may\nbe able to sell such securities only at prices\nlower than if such securities were more widely\nheld. Market quotations for such securities\nare generally less readily\n\n12\n\navailable than for publicly traded securities.\nThe absence of a trading market can make it\ndifficult to ascertain a market value for such\nsecurities for purposes of computing the\nFund's net asset value, and the judgment of\nthe Adviser may at times play a greater role\nin valuing these securities than in the case\nof publicly traded securities. Disposing of\nsuch securities, which may be illiquid\ninvestments, can involve time-consuming\nnegotiation and legal expenses, and it may be\ndifficult or impossible for the Fund to sell\nthem promptly at an acceptable price. The Fund\nmay have to bear the extra expense of\nregistering such securities for resale and the\nrisk of substantial delay in effecting such\nregistration. The Fund may be deemed to be an\n\u201c underwriter \u201d for purposes of the Securities\nAct when selling restricted securities to the\npublic, and in such event the Fund may be\nliable to purchasers of such securities if the\nregistration statement prepared by the issuer,\nor the prospectus forming a part of it, is\nmaterially inaccurate or misleading. REAL\nESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS ( \u201c REITs \u201d ) REITs\npool investors' funds for investment primarily\nin income producing real estate or real estate\nloans or interests. A REIT is not taxed on\nincome distributed to shareholders if it\ncomplies with several requirements relating to\nits organization, ownership, assets, and\nincome and a requirement that it distribute to\nits shareholders at least 90% of its taxable\nincome (other than net capital gains) for each\ntaxable year. REITs can generally be\nclassified as Equity REITs, Mortgage REITs and\nHybrid REITs. Equity REITs, which invest the\nmajority of their assets directly in real\nproperty, derive their income primarily from\nrents. Equity REITs can also realize capital\ngains by selling properties that have\nappreciated in value. Mortgage REITs, which\ninvest the majority of their assets in real\nestate mortgages, derive their income\nprimarily from interest payments. Hybrid REITs\ncombine the characteristics of both Equity\nREITs and Mortgage REITs. The Fund will not\ninvest in real estate directly, but only in\nsecurities issued by real estate companies.\nHowever, the Fund may be subject to risks\nsimilar to those associated with the direct\nownership of real estate (in addition to\nsecurities markets risks) to the extent it\ninvests in the securities of companies in the\nreal estate industry. These include declines\nin the value of real estate, risks related to\ngeneral and local economic conditions,\ndependency on management skill, heavy cash\nflow dependency, possible lack of availability\nof mortgage funds, overbuilding, extended\nvacancies of properties, increased\ncompetition, increases in property taxes and\noperating expenses, changes in zoning laws,\nlosses due to costs resulting from the clean-\nup of environmental problems, liability to\nthird parties for damages resulting from\nenvironmental problems, casualty or\ncondemnation losses, limitations on rents,\nchanges in neighborhood values, the appeal of\nproperties to tenants and changes in interest\nrates. Investments in REITs may subject Fund\nshareholders to duplicate management and\nadministrative fees. In addition to these\nrisks, Equity REITs may be affected by changes\nin the value of the underlying property owned\nby the trusts, while Mortgage REITs may be\naffected by the quality of any credit\nextended. Further, Equity and Mortgage REITs\nare dependent upon management skills and\ngenerally may not be diversified. Equity and\nMortgage REITs are also subject to heavy cash\nflow dependency, defaults by borrowers and\nself-liquidation. In addition, Equity and\nMortgage REITs could possibly fail to qualify\nfor the beneficial tax treatment available to\nREITs under the Internal Revenue Code, or to\nmaintain their exemptions from registration\nunder the 1940 Act. The above factors may also\nadversely affect a borrower's or a lessee's\nability to meet its obligations to the REIT.\nIn the event of a default by a borrower or\nlessee, the REIT may experience delays in\nenforcing its rights as a mortgagee or lessor\nand may incur substantial costs associated\nwith protecting investments. REPURCHASE\nAGREEMENTS The Fund may invest in repurchase\nagreements with commercial banks, brokers or\ndealers to generate income from its excess\ncash balances and to invest securities lending\ncash collateral. A repurchase agreement is an\nagreement under which the Fund acquires a\nfinancial instrument (e.g., a security issued\nby the U.S. government or an agency thereof, a\nbanker's acceptance or a certificate of\ndeposit) from a seller, subject to resale to\nthe seller at an agreed upon price and date\n(normally, the next Business Day\u2014as defined\nbelow). A repurchase agreement may be\nconsidered a loan collateralized by\nsecurities. The resale price reflects an\nagreed upon interest rate effective for the\nperiod the instrument is held by the Fund and\nis unrelated to the interest rate on the\nunderlying instrument. In these repurchase\nagreement transactions, the securities\nacquired by the Fund (including accrued\ninterest earned thereon) must have a total\nvalue in excess of the value of the repurchase\nagreement and are held by the Custodian until\nrepurchased. No more than an aggregate of 15%\nof the Fund's net assets will be invested in\nilliquid investments, including repurchase\nagreements having maturities longer than seven\ndays and securities subject to legal or\ncontractual restrictions on resale, or for\nwhich there are no readily available market\nquotations.\n\n13\n\nThe use of repurchase agreements involves\ncertain risks. For example, if the other party\nto the agreement defaults on its obligation to\nrepurchase the underlying security at a time\nwhen the value of the security has declined,\nthe Fund may incur a loss upon disposition of\nthe security. If the other party to the\nagreement becomes insolvent and subject to\nliquidation or reorganization under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or other laws, a court may\ndetermine that the underlying security is\ncollateral for a loan by the Fund not within\nthe control of the Fund and, therefore, the\nFund may not be able to substantiate its\ninterest in the underlying security and may be\ndeemed an unsecured creditor of the other\nparty to the agreement. REVERSE REPURCHASE\nAGREEMENTS The Fund may enter into reverse\nrepurchase agreements, which involve the sale\nof securities with an agreement to repurchase\nthe securities at an agreed-upon price, date\nand interest payment and have the\ncharacteristics of borrowing. The securities\npurchased with the funds obtained from the\nagreement and securities collateralizing the\nagreement will have maturity dates no later\nthan the repayment date. Generally the effect\nof such transactions is that the Fund can\nrecover all or most of the cash invested in\nthe portfolio securities involved during the\nterm of the reverse repurchase agreement,\nwhile in many cases the Fund is able to keep\nsome of the interest income associated with\nthose securities. Such transactions are only\nadvantageous if the Fund has an opportunity to\nearn a greater rate of interest on the cash\nderived from these transactions than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available and the Fund intends to\nuse the reverse repurchase technique only when\nthe Adviser believes it will be advantageous\nto the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase\nagreements may exaggerate any interim increase\nor decrease in the value of the Fund's assets.\nThe Fund may enter into reverse repurchase\nagreements if it either meets the relevant\nasset coverage requirements of Section 18 of\nthe 1940 Act for senior securities\nrepresenting indebtedness, or elects to treat\nsuch arrangements as derivatives transactions\nunder the Derivatives Rule. The Fund does not\nexpect to engage, under normal circumstances,\nin reverse repurchase agreements with respect\nto more than 10% of its total assets. U.S.\nREGISTERED SECURITIES OF FOREIGN ISSUERS\nInvesting in U.S. registered, dollar-\ndenominated, securities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers involves some risks and considerations\nnot typically associated with investing in\nU.S. companies. These include differences in\naccounting, auditing and financial reporting\nstandards, the possibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation, adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations,\npolitical instability which could affect U.S.\ninvestments in foreign countries, and\npotential restrictions of the flow of\ninternational capital. Foreign companies may\nbe subject to less governmental regulation\nthan U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual\nforeign economies may differ favorably or\nunfavorably from the U.S. economy in such\nrespects as growth of gross domestic product,\nrate of inflation, capital reinvestment,\nresource self-sufficiency and balance of\npayment positions. The Fund's investment in\nequity securities of foreign corporations may\nalso be in the form of American Depositary\nReceipts ( \u201c ADRs \u201d ), Global Depositary\nReceipts ( \u201c GDRs \u201d ) and European Depositary\nReceipts ( \u201c EDRs \u201d ) (collectively \u201c\nDepositary Receipts \u201d ). Depositary Receipts\nare receipts, typically issued by a bank or\ntrust company, which evidence ownership of\nunderlying securities issued by a foreign\ncorporation. For ADRs, the depository is\ntypically a U.S. financial institution and the\nunderlying securities are issued by a foreign\nissuer. For other Depositary Receipts, the\ndepository may be a foreign or a U.S. entity,\nand the underlying securities may have a\nforeign or a U.S. issuer. Depositary Receipts\nwill not necessarily be denominated in the\nsame currency as their underlying securities.\nGenerally, ADRs, in registered form, are\ndesigned for use in the U.S. securities\nmarkets, and EDRs, in bearer form, are\ndesignated for use in European securities\nmarkets. GDRs are tradable both in the United\nStates and in Europe and are designed for use\nthroughout the world. The Fund may invest in\nunsponsored Depositary Receipts. The issuers\nof unsponsored Depositary Receipts are not\nobligated to disclose material information in\nthe United States, and, therefore, there may\nbe less information available regarding such\nissuers and there may not be a correlation\nbetween such information and the market value\nof the Depositary Receipts. WHEN-ISSUED\nSECURITIES The Fund may purchase securities on\na when-issued basis. Delivery of and payment\nfor these securities may take place as long as\na month or more after the date of the purchase\ncommitment. The value of these securities is\nsubject to market fluctuation during this\nperiod, and no income accrues to the Fund\nuntil settlement takes place. When entering\ninto a when-issued transaction, the Fund will\nrely on the other party to consummate the\ntransaction; if the other party fails to do\nso, the Fund may be disadvantaged.\n\n14\n\nSecurities purchased on a when-issued basis\nand held by the Fund are subject to changes in\nmarket value based upon actual or perceived\nchanges in the level of interest rates.\nGenerally, the value of such securities will\nfluctuate inversely to changes in interest\nrates \u2014 i.e., they will appreciate in value\nwhen interest rates decline and decrease in\nvalue when interest rates rise. Therefore, if\nthe Fund purchases securities on a \u201c when-\nissued \u201d basis, there may be a greater\npossibility of fluctuation in the Fund's NAV.\nSpecial Considerations and Risks A discussion\nof the risks associated with an investment in\nthe Fund is contained in the Prospectus. The\ndiscussion below supplements, and should be\nread in conjunction with, the Prospectus.\nGENERAL Investment in the Fund should be made\nwith an understanding that the value of the\nFund's portfolio securities may fluctuate in\naccordance with changes in the financial\ncondition of the issuers of the portfolio\nsecurities, the value of securities generally\nand other factors. An investment in the Fund\nshould also be made with an understanding of\nthe risks inherent in an investment in\nsecurities, including the risk that the\nfinancial condition of issuers may become\nimpaired or that the general condition of the\nsecurities markets may deteriorate (either of\nwhich may cause a decrease in the value of the\nportfolio securities and thus in the value of\nShares). Securities are susceptible to general\nmarket fluctuations and to volatile increases\nand decreases in value as market confidence in\nand perceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic and banking\ncrises. Securities of issuers traded on\nexchanges may be suspended on certain\nexchanges by the issuers themselves, by an\nexchange or by government authorities. The\nlikelihood of such suspensions may be higher\nfor securities of issuers in emerging or less-\ndeveloped market countries than in countries\nwith more developed markets. Trading\nsuspensions may be applied from time to time\nto the securities of individual issuers for\nreasons specific to that issuer, or may be\napplied broadly by exchanges or governmental\nauthorities in response to market events.\nSuspensions may last for significant periods\nof time, during which trading in the\nsecurities and instruments that reference the\nsecurities, such as participatory notes (or \u201c\nP-notes \u201d ) or other derivative instruments,\nmay be halted. The principal trading market\nfor some of the securities in an Index may be\nin the over-the-counter market. The existence\nof a liquid trading market for certain\nsecurities may depend on whether dealers will\nmake a market in such securities. There can be\nno assurance that a market will be made or\nmaintained or that any such market will be or\nremain liquid. The price at which securities\nmay be sold and the value of the Fund's Shares\nwill be adversely affected if trading markets\nfor the Fund's portfolio securities are\nlimited or absent or if bid/ask spreads are\nwide. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK An investment\nin the Fund may be subject to a number of\nactual or potential conflicts of interest. For\nexample, the Adviser or its affiliates may\nprovide services to the Fund, such as\nsecurities lending agency services, custodial,\nadministrative, bookkeeping, and accounting\nservices, transfer agency and shareholder\nservicing, securities brokerage services, and\nother services for which the Fund would\ncompensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates.\nThe Fund may invest in other pooled investment\nvehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise\naffiliated with the Adviser. There is no\nassurance that the rates at which the Fund\npays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its\naffiliates, or the terms on which it enters\ninto transactions with the Adviser or its\naffiliates, will be the most favorable\navailable in the market generally or as\nfavorable as the rates the Adviser makes\navailable to other clients. Because of its\nfinancial interest, the Adviser may have an\nincentive to enter into transactions or\narrangements on behalf of the Fund with itself\nor its affiliates in circumstances where it\nmight not have done so in the absence of that\ninterest.\n\n15\n\nCONTINUOUS OFFERING The method by which\nCreation Units of Shares are created and\ntraded may raise certain issues under\napplicable securities laws. Because new\nCreation Units of Shares are issued and sold\nby the Trust on an ongoing basis, at any point\na \u201c distribution, \u201d as such term is used in\nthe Securities Act, may occur. Broker-dealers\nand other persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nwhich could render them statutory underwriters\nand subject them to the prospectus delivery\nand liability provisions of the Securities\nAct. For example, a broker-dealer firm or its\nclient may be deemed a statutory underwriter\nif it takes Creation Units after placing an\norder with the Distributor, breaks them down\ninto constituent Shares, and sells such Shares\ndirectly to customers, or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of a supply of new Shares\nwith an active selling effort involving\nsolicitation of secondary market demand for\nShares. A determination of whether one is an\nunderwriter for purposes of the Securities Act\nmust take into account all the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the activities of\nthe broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case, and the examples mentioned\nabove should not be considered a complete\ndescription of all the activities that could\nlead to a categorization as an underwriter.\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\neffecting transactions in Shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nShares, are generally required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\nSecurities Act is not available in respect of\nsuch transactions as a result of Section 24(d)\nof the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a\nprospectus-delivery obligation with respect to\nShares of the Fund are reminded that under\nSecurities Act Rule 153, a prospectus-delivery\nobligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the\nSecurities Act owed to an exchange member in\nconnection with a sale on the Exchange is\nsatisfied by the fact that the Fund's\nProspectus is available at the Exchange upon\nrequest. The prospectus delivery mechanism\nprovided in Rule 153 is only available with\nrespect to transactions on an exchange. SSGA\nor its affiliates (the \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n) may purchase Creation Units through a\nbroker-dealer to \u201c seed \u201d (in whole or in\npart) the Fund as it is launched, or may\npurchase shares from broker-dealers or other\ninvestors that have previously provided \u201c seed\n\u201d for the Fund when it was launched or\notherwise in secondary market transactions,\nand because the Selling Shareholder may be\ndeemed an affiliate of the Fund, the Shares\nare being registered to permit the resale of\nthese shares from time to time after purchase.\nThe Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese Shares. The Selling Shareholder intends\nto sell all or a portion of the Shares owned\nby it and offered hereby from time to time\ndirectly or through one or more broker-\ndealers, and may also hedge such positions.\nThe Shares may be sold on any national\nsecurities exchange on which the Shares may be\nlisted or quoted at the time of sale, in the\nover-the-counter market or in transactions\nother than on these exchanges or systems at\nfixed prices, at prevailing market prices at\nthe time of the sale, at varying prices\ndetermined at the time of sale, or at\nnegotiated prices. These sales may be effected\nin transactions, which may involve cross or\nblock transactions. The Selling Shareholder\nmay also loan or pledge Shares to broker-\ndealers that in turn may sell such Shares, to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. The\nSelling Shareholder may also enter into\noptions or other transactions with broker-\ndealers or other financial institutions or the\ncreation of one or more derivative securities\nwhich require the delivery to such broker-\ndealer or other financial institution of\nShares, which Shares such broker-dealer or\nother financial institution may resell. The\nSelling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or\nagents participating in the distribution of\nShares may be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the\nSecurities Act in connection with such sales.\nIn such event, any commissions paid to any\nsuch broker-dealer or agent and any profit on\nthe resale of the Shares purchased by them may\nbe deemed to be underwriting commissions or\ndiscounts under the Securities Act. The\nSelling Shareholder who may be deemed an \u201c\nunderwriter \u201d within the meaning of Section\n2(a)(11) of the Securities Act will be subject\nto the applicable prospectus delivery\nrequirements of the Securities Act.\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK Counterparty risk with\nrespect to derivatives has been and may\ncontinue to be affected by new rules and\nregulations affecting the derivatives market.\nSome derivatives transactions are required to\nbe centrally cleared, and a party to a cleared\nderivatives transaction is subject to the\ncredit risk of the clearing house and the\nclearing member through which it holds its\ncleared position, rather than the credit risk\nof its original counterparty to the\nderivatives transaction. Credit risk of\n\n16\n\nmarket participants with respect to\nderivatives that are centrally cleared is\nconcentrated in a few clearing houses, and it\nis not clear how an insolvency proceeding of a\nclearing house would be conducted, what effect\nthe insolvency proceeding would have on any\nrecovery by the Fund, and what impact an\ninsolvency of a clearing house would have on\nthe financial system more generally. FUTURES\nAND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS There can be no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market will\nexist for any particular futures contract or\noption at any specific time. Thus, it may not\nbe possible to close a futures or options\nposition. In the event of adverse price\nmovements, the Fund would continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if the Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, the Fund may be required to make\ndelivery of the instruments underlying futures\ncontracts it has sold. The Fund will minimize\nthe risk that it will be unable to close out a\nfutures or options contract by only entering\ninto futures and options for which there\nappears to be a liquid secondary market. The\nrisk of loss in trading futures contracts or\nuncovered call options in some strategies\n(e.g., selling uncovered index futures\ncontracts) is potentially unlimited. The Fund\ndoes not plan to use futures and options\ncontracts, when available, in this manner. The\nrisk of a futures position may still be large\nas traditionally measured due to the low\nmargin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, may utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit its risk exposure to that\nwhich is comparable to what it would have\nincurred through direct investment in\nsecurities. Utilization of futures\ntransactions by the Fund involves the risk of\nimperfect or even negative correlation to its\nbenchmark Index if the index underlying the\nfutures contracts differs from the benchmark\nIndex or if the futures contracts do not track\nthe benchmark Index as expected. There is also\nthe risk of loss by the Fund of margin\ndeposits in the event of bankruptcy of a\nbroker with whom the Fund has an open position\nin the futures contract or option. Certain\nfinancial futures exchanges limit the amount\nof fluctuation permitted in futures contract\nprices during a single trading day. The \u201c\ndaily price fluctuation limit \u201d or \u201c daily\nlimit \u201d establishes the maximum amount that\nthe price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day's\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, generally no\ntrades may be made on that day at a price\nbeyond that limit. The daily limit governs\nonly price movement during a particular\ntrading day and therefore does not limit\npotential losses, because the limit may\nprevent the liquidation of unfavorable\npositions. Futures contract prices have\noccasionally moved to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting some futures traders to substantial\nlosses. RISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS Swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nswap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, the\nFund will have contractual remedies pursuant\nto the agreements related to the transaction,\nbut such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy\nand insolvency laws which could affect the\nFund's rights as a creditor. The use of\ninterest-rate and index swaps is a highly\nspecialized activity that involves investment\ntechniques and risks different from those\nassociated with ordinary portfolio security\ntransactions. The use of a swap requires an\nunderstanding not only of the referenced\nasset, reference rate, or index, but also of\nthe swap itself, without the benefit of\nobserving the performance of the swap under\nall possible market conditions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the\ndelivery of securities or other underlying\nassets or principal. The absence of a\nregulated execution facility or contract\nmarket and lack of liquidity for swap\ntransactions has led, in some instances, to\ndifficulties in trading and valuation,\nespecially in the event of market disruptions.\nUnder recently adopted rules and regulations,\ntransactions in some types of swaps are\nrequired to be centrally cleared. In a cleared\nderivatives transaction, the Fund's\ncounterparty to the transaction is a central\nderivatives clearing organization, or clearing\nhouse, rather than a bank or broker. Because\nthe Fund is not a member of a clearing house,\nand only members of a clearing house can\nparticipate directly in the clearing house,\nthe Fund holds cleared derivatives through\naccounts at clearing members. In cleared\nderivatives transactions, the Fund will make\npayments (including margin payments) to and\nreceive payments from a clearing house through\nits accounts at clearing members. Clearing\nmembers guarantee performance of their\nclients' obligations to the clearing house.\nCentrally cleared derivative arrangements may\nbe less\n\n17\n\nfavorable to the Fund than bilateral (non-\ncleared) arrangements. For example, the Fund\nmay be required to provide greater amounts of\nmargin for cleared derivatives transactions\nthan for bilateral derivatives transactions.\nAlso, in contrast to bilateral derivatives\ntransactions, in some cases following a period\nof notice to the Fund, a clearing member\ngenerally can require termination of existing\ncleared derivatives transactions at any time\nor an increase in margin requirements above\nthe margin that the clearing member required\nat the beginning of a transaction. Clearing\nhouses also have broad rights to increase\nmargin requirements for existing transactions\nor to terminate transactions at any time in\naccordance with their rules. The Fund is\nsubject to risk if it enters into a\nderivatives transaction that is required to be\ncleared (or which SSGA FM expects to be\ncleared), and no clearing member is willing or\nable to clear the transaction on the Fund's\nbehalf. In that case, the transaction might\nhave to be terminated, and the Fund could lose\nsome or all of the benefit of the transaction,\nincluding loss of an increase in the value of\nthe transaction and loss of hedging\nprotection. In addition, the documentation\ngoverning the relationship between the Fund\nand clearing members is drafted by the\nclearing members and generally is less\nfavorable to the Fund than typical bilateral\nderivatives documentation. These clearing\nrules and other new rules and regulations\ncould, among other things, restrict the Fund's\nability to engage in, or increase the cost to\nthe Fund of, derivatives transactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available to the Fund, increasing\nmargin or capital requirements, or otherwise\nlimiting liquidity or increasing transaction\ncosts. These regulations, as applicable to\nswaps, are relatively new and evolving, so\ntheir potential impact on the Fund and the\nfinancial system are not yet known. Because\nthey are two party contracts that may be\nsubject to contractual restrictions on\ntransferability and termination and because\nthey may have terms of greater than seven\ndays, swap agreements may be considered to be\nilliquid and subject to the Fund's limitation\non investments in illiquid investments. To the\nextent that a swap is not liquid, it may not\nbe possible to initiate a transaction or\nliquidate a position at an advantageous time\nor price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Like most other investments, swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nmarket value of the instrument will change in\na way detrimental to the Fund's interest. If\nthe Fund uses a swap as a hedge against, or as\na substitute for, a portfolio investment, the\nFund will be exposed to the risk that the swap\nwill have or will develop imperfect or no\ncorrelation with the portfolio investment.\nThis could cause substantial losses for the\nFund. While hedging strategies involving swap\ninstruments can reduce the risk of loss, they\ncan also reduce the opportunity for gain or\neven result in losses by offsetting favorable\nprice movements in other Fund investments.\nMany swaps are complex and often valued\nsubjectively. EUROPE \u2013 RECENT EVENTS A number\nof countries in Europe, including Greece,\nSpain, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal, have\nsubstantial government debt levels. The\nconcern over these debt levels has led to\nvolatility in the European financial markets,\nwhich has adversely affected the exchange rate\nof the euro and may continue to significantly\naffect every country in Europe. For some\ncountries, the ability to repay sovereign debt\nis in question, and default is possible, which\ncould affect their ability to borrow in the\nfuture. Several countries have agreed to\nmulti-year bailout loans from the European\nCentral Bank, the IMF, and other institutions.\nA default or debt restructuring by any\nEuropean country can adversely impact holders\nof that country's debt and can affect\nexposures to other European Union ( \u201c EU \u201d )\ncountries and their financial companies as\nwell. These financial difficulties may\ncontinue, worsen or spread within or outside\nEurope. Responses to the financial problems by\nEuropean governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not work, may result in social\nunrest and may limit future growth and\neconomic recovery or have other unintended\nconsequences. Uncertainties regarding the\nviability of the EU have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact markets in the United\nStates and around the world. On January 31,\n2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew\nfrom the EU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit\n\u201d ) and entered an 11-month transition period.\nThe transition period concluded on December\n31, 2020, and the United Kingdom left the EU\nsingle market and customs union under the\nterms of a new trade agreement. The agreement\ngoverns the new relationship between the\nUnited Kingdom and EU with respect to trading\ngoods and services, but critical aspects of\nthe relationship remain unresolved and subject\nto further negotiation and agreement. The full\nscope and nature of the consequences of the\nexit are not at this time known and are\nunlikely to be known for a significant period\nof time. It is also unknown whether the United\nKingdom's exit will increase the likelihood of\nother countries also departing the EU. Any\nadditional exits from the EU, or the\npossibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments.\n\n18\n\nLIBOR RISK Instruments or contracts in which\nthe Fund invests may pay interest at floating\nor adjusting rates based on LIBOR or may be\nsubject to interest caps or floors tied to\nLIBOR. LIBOR is used extensively in the U.S.\nand globally as a benchmark or reference rate\nfor various commercial and financial\ncontracts, including corporate and municipal\nbonds, bank loans, asset-backed and mortgage-\nrelated securities, interest rate swaps and\nother derivatives. [On July 27, 2017, the\nUnited Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority\n(FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that\nafter 2021, it would cease its active\nencouragement of banks to provide quotations\nneeded to sustain the LIBOR rate. On March 5,\n2021, the administrator of LIBOR announced a\ndelay in the phase out of the majority of the\nUSD LIBOR publications until June 30, 2023,\nwhile the remainder of USD LIBOR publications\nceased on December 31, 2021. The U.S. Federal\nReserve, in conjunction with the Alternative\nReference Rates Committee, a steering\ncommittee comprised of large U.S. financial\ninstitutions, has identified the Secured\nOvernight Financial Rate (SOFR) as the\npreferred alternative rate to LIBOR. SOFR is a\nrelatively new index calculated by short-term\nrepurchase agreements, backed by Treasury\nsecurities. While some instruments or\ncontracts may contemplate a scenario where\nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for\nan alternative rate setting methodology, not\nall instruments or contracts may have such \u201c\nfallback provisions. \u201d Abandonment of or\nmodifications to LIBOR could lead to\nsignificant short-term and long-term\nuncertainty and market instability and the\nextent to which that may impact the Fund may\nvary depending on various factors, which\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) existing\nfallback or termination provisions in\nindividual contracts and (ii) whether, how,\nand when industry participants develop and\nadopt new successor reference rates and/or\nfallbacks for both legacy and new instruments\nor contracts. To address the potential risks\nand uncertainty associated with instruments or\ncontracts containing no fallback provisions,\nin March 2022, the Biden administration\nenacted legislation that provides a uniform\nnational approach for replacing USD LIBOR. In\ninstances where a contract or instrument does\nnot contain an effective fallback provision,\nthe USD LIBOR rate will be replaced by a rate\nbased on SOFR that is selected by the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System. The\ntransition to a successor rate may result in\n(i) increased volatility or illiquidity in\nmarkets for instruments or contracts that\ncurrently rely on LIBOR, (ii) a reduction in\nthe value of certain instruments or contracts\nheld by the Fund, (iii) reduced effectiveness\nof related Fund transactions, such as hedging,\n(iv) additional tax, accounting and regulatory\nrisks, or (v) costs incurred in connection\nwith closing out positions and entering into\nnew trades. Any pricing adjustments to the\nFund's investments resulting from a substitute\nreference rate may also adversely affect the\nFund's performance and/or NAV. Additionally,\nif LIBOR ultimately ceases to exist, the Fund\nmay need to renegotiate the credit agreements\nextending beyond the LIBOR phase out date with\nthe Fund's obligors that utilize LIBOR as a\nfactor in determining the interest rate and\ncertain of the Fund's existing credit\nfacilities to replace LIBOR with a new rate.\nAny pricing adjustments to the Fund's\ninvestments resulting from a substitute\nreference rate may also adversely affect the\nFund's performance and/or NAV. There is no\nassurance that the composition or\ncharacteristics of any such alternative\nreference rate will be similar to or produce\nthe same value or economic equivalence as\nLIBOR or that instruments or contracts using\nan alternative rate will have the same volume\nor liquidity.] MARKET TURBULENCE RESULTING\nFROM COVID-19 An outbreak of a respiratory\ndisease caused by a novel coronavirus (known\nas COVID-19) first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has spread globally. In an\norganized attempt to contain and mitigate the\neffects of the spread of COVID-19, governments\nand businesses world-wide took and may\ncontinue to take aggressive measures,\nincluding closing borders, restricting\ninternational and domestic travel, and the\nimposition of prolonged quarantines of large\npopulations. COVID-19 has resulted in and may\ncontinue to result in the disruption of and\ndelays in the delivery of healthcare services\nand processes, the cancellation of organized\nevents and educational institutions, the\ndisruption of production and supply chains, a\ndecline in consumer demand for certain goods\nand services, and general concern and\nuncertainty, all of which have contributed to\nincreased volatility in global markets. The\neffects of COVID-19 will likely affect certain\nsectors and industries more dramatically than\nothers, which may adversely affect the value\nof the Fund's investments in those sectors or\nindustries. COVID-19, and other epidemics and\npandemics that may arise in the future, could\nadversely affect the economies of many\nnations, the global economy, individual\ncompanies and capital markets in ways that\ncannot be foreseen at the present time. In\naddition, the impact of infectious diseases in\ndeveloping or emerging market countries may be\ngreater due to limited health care resources.\nPolitical, economic and social stresses caused\nby COVID-19 also may exacerbate other pre-\nexisting political, social and economic risks\nin certain countries. The duration of COVID-19\nand its effects cannot be determined at this\ntime, but the effects could be present for an\nextended period of time.\n\n19\n\nRUSSIA SANCTIONS RISK Sanctions threatened or\nimposed by a number of jurisdictions,\nincluding the United States, the European\nUnion and the United Kingdom, and other\nintergovernmental actions that have been or\nmay be undertaken in the future, against\nRussia, Russian entities or Russian\nindividuals, may result in the devaluation of\nRussian currency, a downgrade in the country's\ncredit rating, an immediate freeze of Russian\nassets, a decline in the value and liquidity\nof Russian securities, property or interests,\nand/or other adverse consequences to the\nRussian economy or the Fund. The scope and\nscale of sanctions in place at a particular\ntime may be expanded or otherwise modified in\na way that have negative effects on the Fund.\nSanctions, or the threat of new or modified\nsanctions, could impair the ability of the\nFund to buy, sell, hold, receive, deliver or\notherwise transact in certain affected\nsecurities or other investment instruments.\nSanctions could also result in Russia taking\ncounter measures or other actions in response,\nwhich may further impair the value and\nliquidity of Russian securities. These\nsanctions, and the resulting disruption of the\nRussian economy, may cause volatility in other\nregional and global markets and may negatively\nimpact the performance of various sectors and\nindustries, as well as companies in other\ncountries, which could have a negative effect\non the performance of the Fund, even if the\nFund does not have direct exposure to\nsecurities of Russian issuers. As a collective\nresult of the imposition of sanctions, Russian\ngovernment countermeasures and the impact that\nthey have had on the trading markets for\nRussian securities, the Fund may use fair\nvaluation procedures approved by the Fund's\nBoard to value certain Russian securities,\nwhich could result in such securities being\ndeemed to have a zero value. A reduction in\nliquidity of certain Fund holdings as a result\nof sanctions and related actions may cause the\nFund to experience increased premiums or\ndiscounts to its NAV and/or wider bid-ask\nspreads. Additionally, if it becomes\nimpracticable or unlawful for the Fund to hold\nsecurities subject to, or otherwise affected\nby, sanctions, or if deemed appropriate by the\nFund's investment adviser, the Fund may\nprohibit in-kind deposits of the affected\nsecurities in connection with creation\ntransactions and instead require a cash\ndeposit, which may also increase the Fund's\ntransaction costs. TAX RISKS As with any\ninvestment, you should consider how your\ninvestment in Shares of the Fund will be\ntaxed. The tax information in the Prospectus\nand this SAI is provided as general\ninformation. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in Shares of the Fund. Unless your\ninvestment in Shares is made through a tax-\nexempt entity or tax-advantaged retirement\naccount, such as an individual retirement\naccount, you need to be aware of the possible\ntax consequences when the Fund makes\ndistributions or you sell Shares. Investment\nRestrictions The Trust has adopted the\nfollowing investment restrictions as\nfundamental policies with respect to the Fund.\nThese restrictions cannot be changed without\nthe approval of the holders of a majority of\nthe Fund's outstanding voting securities. For\npurposes of the 1940 Act, a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund\nmeans the vote, at an annual or a special\nmeeting of the security holders of the Trust,\nof the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the voting\nsecurities of the Fund present at such\nmeeting, if the holders of more than 50% of\nthe outstanding voting securities of the Fund\nare present or represented by proxy, or (2)\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund. Except with the\napproval of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities, the Fund may not: 1.\nConcentrate its investments in securities of\nissuers in the same industry, except as may be\nnecessary to approximate the composition of\nthe Fund's underlying Index; (1) 2. Make loans\nto another person except as permitted by the\n1940 Act or other governing statute, by the\nRules thereunder, or by the SEC or other\nregulatory agency with authority over the\nFund; 3. Issue senior securities or borrow\nmoney except as permitted by the 1940 Act or\nother governing statute, by the Rules\nthereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory\nagency with authority over the Fund; 4. Invest\ndirectly in real estate unless the real estate\nis acquired as a result of ownership of\nsecurities or other instruments. This\nrestriction shall not preclude the Fund from\ninvesting in companies that deal in real\nestate or in instruments that are backed or\nsecured by real estate;\n\n(1) The SEC Staff considers concentration to\ninvolve more than 25% of a fund's assets to be\ninvested in an industry or group of\nindustries.\n\n20\n\n5. Act as an underwriter of another issuer's\nsecurities, except to the extent the Fund may\nbe deemed to be an underwriter within the\nmeaning of the Securities Act in connection\nwith the Fund's purchase and sale of portfolio\nsecurities; or 6. Invest in commodities except\nas permitted by the 1940 Act or other\ngoverning statute, by the Rules thereunder, or\nby the SEC or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund. In addition to the\ninvestment restrictions adopted as fundamental\npolicies as set forth above, the Fund observes\nthe following restrictions, which may be\nchanged by the Board without a shareholder\nvote. The Fund will not: 1. Invest in the\nsecurities of a company for the purpose of\nexercising management or control, provided\nthat the Trust may vote the investment\nsecurities owned by the Fund in accordance\nwith its views; or 2. Under normal\ncircumstances, invest less than 80% of its\ntotal assets in securities that comprise the\nbenchmark Index; or 3. Under normal\ncircumstances, invest less than 80% of its net\nassets, plus the amount of borrowings for\ninvestment purposes, in dividend-paying\ncompanies. Prior to any change in the Fund's\n80% investment policy, the Fund will provide\nshareholders with 60 days' written notice. The\nFund defines the foregoing terms in accordance\nwith the definition of such terms per the\napplicable Index. If a percentage limitation\nis adhered to at the time of investment or\ncontract, a later increase or decrease in\npercentage resulting from any change in value\nor total or net assets will not result in a\nviolation of such restriction, except that the\npercentage limitations with respect to the\nborrowing of money will be observed\ncontinuously. With respect to the limitation\non borrowing, in the event that a subsequent\nchange in net assets or other circumstances\ncause the Fund to exceed its limitation, the\nFund will take steps to bring the aggregate\namount of borrowing back within the\nlimitations within three days thereafter (not\nincluding Sundays and holidays). The 1940 Act\ncurrently permits the Fund to loan up to 33\n1/3% of its total assets. With respect to\nborrowing, the 1940 Act presently allows the\nFund to: (1) borrow from any bank (including\npledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets)\nin an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total\nassets, (2) borrow money for temporary\npurposes in an amount not exceeding 5% of the\nvalue of the Fund's total assets at the time\nof the loan, and (3) enter into reverse\nrepurchase agreements. However, under normal\ncircumstances any borrowings by the Fund will\nnot exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. The\n1940 Act generally prohibits funds from\nissuing senior securities, although it does\nnot treat certain transactions as senior\nsecurities, such as certain borrowings, with\nappropriate asset coverage. With respect to\ninvestments in commodities, the 1940 Act\npresently permits the Fund to invest in\ncommodities in accordance with investment\npolicies contained in its prospectus and SAI.\nAny such investment shall also comply with the\nCEA and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe 1940 Act does not directly restrict an\ninvestment company's ability to invest in real\nestate, but does require that every investment\ncompany have the fundamental investment policy\ngoverning such investments. The Fund will not\npurchase or sell real estate, except that the\nFund may invest in companies that deal in real\nestate (including REITs) or in instruments\nthat are backed or secured by real estate.\nExchange Listing and Trading A discussion of\nexchange listing and trading matters\nassociated with an investment in the Fund is\ncontained in the Prospectus under \u201c PURCHASE\nAND SALE INFORMATION \u201d and \u201c ADDITIONAL\nPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d The\ndiscussion below supplements, and should be\nread in conjunction with, such sections of the\nProspectus. The Shares of the Fund are\napproved for listing and trading on the\nExchange, subject to notice of issuance.\nShares trade on the Exchange at prices that\nmay differ to some degree from their net asset\nvalue. There can be no assurance that the\nrequirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of Shares of the Fund\nwill continue to be met. The Exchange may\nconsider the suspension of trading in, and may\ninitiate delisting proceedings of, the Shares\nof the Fund under any of the following\ncircumstances: (i) if the Exchange becomes\naware that the Fund is no longer eligible to\noperate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the\n1940 Act; (ii) if the Fund no longer complies\nwith the applicable listing requirements set\nforth in the Exchange's rules; (iii) if,\nfollowing the initial twelve-month period\nafter commencement of trading on the Exchange\nof the Fund, there are fewer than 50\nbeneficial holders of the Fund; or (iv) if\nsuch other event shall occur or condition\nexists which, in the opinion of the Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Exchange\ninadvisable. The Exchange will remove the\nShares from listing and trading upon\ntermination of the Fund.\n\n21\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nShare price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor's\nequity interest in the Fund. As in the case of\nother publicly traded securities, brokers'\ncommissions on transactions will be based on\nnegotiated commission rates at customary\nlevels. The base and trading currencies of the\nFund is the U.S. dollar. The base currency is\nthe currency in which the Fund's net asset\nvalue per Share is calculated and the trading\ncurrency is the currency in which Shares of\nthe Fund are listed and traded on the\nExchange. Management of the Trust The\nfollowing information supplements and should\nbe read in conjunction with the section in the\nProspectus entitled \u201c MANAGEMENT. \u201d BOARD\nRESPONSIBILITIES The management and affairs of\nthe Trust and its series, including the Fund\ndescribed in this SAI, are overseen by the\nTrustees. The Board has approved contracts, as\ndescribed in this SAI, under which certain\ncompanies provide essential management\nservices to the Trust. Like most mutual funds,\nthe day-to-day business of the Trust,\nincluding the management of risk, is performed\nby third party service providers, such as the\nAdviser, Distributor, Administrator, and Sub-\nAdministrator. The Trustees are responsible\nfor overseeing the Trust's service providers\nand, thus, have oversight responsibility with\nrespect to risk management performed by those\nservice providers. Risk management seeks to\nidentify and address risks, i.e ., events or\ncircumstances that could have material adverse\neffects on the business, operations,\nshareholder services, investment performance\nor reputation of the Fund. The Fund and their\nservice providers employ a variety of\nprocesses, procedures and controls to identify\nvarious of those possible events or\ncircumstances, to lessen the probability of\ntheir occurrence and/or to mitigate the\neffects of such events or circumstances if\nthey do occur. Each service provider is\nresponsible for one or more discrete aspects\nof the Trust's business and, consequently, for\nmanaging the risks associated with that\nbusiness. The Board has emphasized to the\nFund's service providers the importance of\nmaintaining vigorous risk management. The\nTrustees' role in risk oversight begins before\nthe inception of the Fund, at which time the\nFund's Adviser presents the Board with\ninformation concerning the investment\nobjectives, strategies and risks of the Fund,\nas well as proposed investment limitations for\nthe Fund. Additionally, the Fund's Adviser\nprovides the Board with an overview of, among\nother things, their investment philosophies,\nbrokerage practices and compliance\ninfrastructures. Thereafter, the Board\ncontinues its oversight function as various\npersonnel, including the Trust's Chief\nCompliance Officer, as well as personnel of\nthe Adviser and other service providers, such\nas the Fund's independent accountants, make\nperiodic reports to the Audit Committee or to\nthe Board with respect to various aspects of\nrisk management. The Board and the Audit\nCommittee oversee efforts by management and\nservice providers to manage risks to which the\nFund may be exposed. The Board is responsible\nfor overseeing the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided to the Fund by the\nAdviser and receives information about those\nservices at its regular meetings. In addition,\non an annual basis, in connection with its\nconsideration of whether to renew the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with the\nAdviser, the Board meets with the Adviser to\nreview such services. Among other things, the\nBoard regularly considers the Adviser's\nadherence to the Fund's investment\nrestrictions and compliance with various Fund\npolicies and procedures and with applicable\nsecurities regulations. The Board also reviews\ninformation about the Fund's investments. The\nTrust's Chief Compliance Officer reports\nregularly to the Board to review and discuss\ncompliance issues. At least annually, the\nTrust's Chief Compliance Officer provides the\nBoard with a report reviewing the adequacy and\neffectiveness of the Trust's policies and\nprocedures and those of its service providers,\nincluding the Adviser. The report addresses\nthe operation of the policies and procedures\nof the Trust and each service provider since\nthe date of the last report; any material\nchanges to the policies and procedures since\nthe date of the last report; any\nrecommendations for material changes to the\npolicies and procedures; and any material\ncompliance matters since the date of the last\nreport. The Board receives reports from the\nFund's service providers regarding operational\nrisks and risks related to the valuation and\nliquidity of portfolio securities. Regular\nreports are made to the Board concerning\ninvestments for which market quotations are\nnot readily available. Annually, the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nreviews with the Audit\n\n22\n\nCommittee its audit of the Fund's financial\nstatements, focusing on major areas of risk\nencountered by the Fund and noting any\nsignificant deficiencies or material\nweaknesses in the Fund's internal controls.\nAdditionally, in connection with its oversight\nfunction, the Board oversees Fund management's\nimplementation of disclosure controls and\nprocedures, which are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by the\nTrust in its periodic reports with the SEC are\nrecorded, processed, summarized, and reported\nwithin the required time periods. The Board\nalso oversees the Trust's internal controls\nover financial reporting, which comprise\npolicies and procedures designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof the Trust's financial reporting and the\npreparation of the Trust's financial\nstatements. From their review of these reports\nand discussions with the Adviser, the Chief\nCompliance Officer, the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and other service\nproviders, the Board and the Audit Committee\nlearn in detail about the material risks of\nthe Fund, thereby facilitating a dialogue\nabout how management and service providers\nidentify and mitigate those risks. The Board\nrecognizes that not all risks that may affect\nthe Fund can be identified and/or quantified,\nthat it may not be practical or cost-effective\nto eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that\nit may be necessary to bear certain risks\n(such as investment-related risks) to achieve\nthe Fund's goals, and that the processes,\nprocedures and controls employed to address\ncertain risks may be limited in their\neffectiveness. Moreover, reports received by\nthe Trustees as to risk management matters are\ntypically summaries of the relevant\ninformation. Most of the Fund's investment\nmanagement and business affairs are carried\nout by or through the Fund's Adviser and other\nservice providers, each of which has an\nindependent interest in risk management but\nwhose policies and the methods by which one or\nmore risk management functions are carried out\nmay differ from the Fund's and each other's in\nthe setting of priorities, the resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. As a result of the foregoing and\nother factors, the Board's ability to monitor\nand manage risk, as a practical matter, is\nsubject to limitations. TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS\nThere are eight members of the Board of\nTrustees, six of whom are not interested\npersons of the Trust, as that term is defined\nin the 1940 Act ( \u201c Independent Trustees \u201d ).\nCarl Verboncoeur, an Independent Trustee,\nserves as Chairman of the Board. The Board has\ndetermined its leadership structure is\nappropriate given the specific characteristics\nand circumstances of the Trust. The Board made\nthis determination in consideration of, among\nother things, the fact that the Independent\nTrustees constitute a super-majority (75%) of\nthe Board, the fact that the chairperson of\neach Committee of the Board is an Independent\nTrustee, the amount of assets under management\nin the Trust, and the number of funds overseen\nby the Board. The Board also believes that its\nleadership structure facilitates the orderly\nand efficient flow of information to the\nIndependent Trustees from fund management. The\nBoard of Trustees has two standing committees:\nthe Audit Committee and Trustee Committee. The\nAudit Committee and Trustee Committee are each\nchaired by an Independent Trustee and composed\nof all of the Independent Trustees. Set forth\nbelow are the names, year of birth, position\nwith the Trust, length of term of office, and\nthe principal occupations during the last five\nyears and other directorships held of each of\nthe persons currently serving as a Trustee or\nOfficer of the Trust.

There can be no assurance\nthat the Codes of Ethics will be effective in\npreventing such activities. Each Code of\nEthics, filed as exhibits to this registration\nstatement, may be examined at the office of\nthe SEC in Washington, D.C. or on the Internet\nat the SEC's website at https://www.sec.gov .\nPROXY VOTING POLICIES The Board believes that\nthe voting of proxies on securities held by\nthe Fund is an important element of the\noverall investment process. As such, the Board\nhas delegated the responsibility to vote such\nproxies to the Adviser for the Fund. Each of\nthe Trust's and the Adviser's proxy voting\npolicy is attached at the end of this SAI.\nInformation regarding how the Fund voted\nproxies relating to its portfolio securities\nduring the most recent twelve-month period\nended June 30 is available: (1) without charge\nby calling 1-866-787-2257; (2) on the Fund's\nwebsite at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs ; and\n(3) on the SEC's website at\nhttps://www.sec.gov . DISCLOSURE OF PORTFOLIO\nHOLDINGS POLICY The Trust has adopted a policy\nregarding the disclosure of information about\nthe Trust's portfolio holdings. The Board must\napprove all material amendments to this\npolicy. The Fund's portfolio holdings are\npublicly disseminated each day the Fund is\nopen for business through financial reporting\nand news services including publicly\naccessible Internet web sites. In addition, a\nbasket composition file, which includes the\nsecurity names and share quantities to deliver\nin exchange for Shares, together with\nestimates and actual cash components, is\npublicly disseminated daily prior to the\nopening of the Exchange via the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d ).\nThe basket represents one Creation Unit of the\nFund. The Trust, the Adviser or State Street\nwill not disseminate non-public information\nconcerning the Trust, except information may\nbe made available prior to its public\navailability: (i) to a party for a legitimate\nbusiness purpose related to the day-to-day\noperations of the Fund, including (a) a\nservice provider, (b) the stock exchanges upon\nwhich an ETF is listed, (c) the NSCC, (d) the\nDepository Trust Company, and (e) financial\ndata/research companies such as Morningstar,\nBloomberg L.P., and Reuters, or (ii) to any\nother party for a legitimate business or\nregulatory purpose, upon waiver or exception,\nwith the consent of an applicable Trust\nofficer. Investment Advisory and Other\nServices THE INVESTMENT ADVISER SSGA FM acts\nas investment adviser to the Trust and,\nsubject to the oversight of the Board, is\nresponsible for the investment management of\nthe Fund. As of June 30, 2023, the Adviser\nmanaged approximately $[ ] billion in assets.\nThe Adviser's principal address is One Iron\nStreet, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. The\nAdviser, a Massachusetts corporation, is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Global\nAdvisors, Inc., which itself is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Corporation, a\npublicly held financial holding company. State\nStreet Global Advisors ( \u201c SSGA \u201d ),\nconsisting of the Adviser and other investment\nadvisory affiliates of State Street\nCorporation, is the investment management arm\nof State Street Corporation. The Adviser\nserves as investment adviser to the Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement (\n\u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d ) between\nthe Trust and the Adviser. The Investment\nAdvisory Agreement, with respect to the Fund,\ncontinues in effect for two years from its\neffective date, and thereafter is subject to\nannual approval by (1) the Board or (2) vote\nof a majority of the outstanding voting\nsecurities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, provided that in either event such\ncontinuance also is approved by a majority of\nthe Board who are not interested persons (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust by a\nvote cast in person at a meeting called for\nthe purpose of voting on such approval. The\n\n30\n\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with respect to\nthe Fund is terminable without penalty, on 60\ndays' notice, by the Board or by a vote of the\nholders of a majority (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the Fund's outstanding voting\nsecurities. The Investment Advisory Agreement\nis also terminable upon 60 days' notice by the\nAdviser and will terminate automatically in\nthe event of its assignment (as defined in the\n1940 Act). Under the Investment Advisory\nAgreement, the Adviser, subject to the\noversight of the Board and in conformity with\nthe stated investment policies of the Fund,\nmanages the investment of the Fund's assets.\nThe Adviser is responsible for placing\npurchase and sale orders and providing\ncontinuous supervision of the investment\nportfolio of the Fund. Pursuant to the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is\nnot liable for certain liabilities, including\ncertain liabilities arising under the federal\nsecurities laws, unless such loss or liability\nresults from willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence in the performance of its\nduties or the reckless disregard of its\nobligations and duties. For the services\nprovided to the Fund under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser\nmonthly fees based on a percentage of the\nFund's average daily net assets as set forth\nin the Fund's Prospectus. From time to time,\nthe Adviser may waive all or a portion of its\nfee. The Adviser pays all expenses of the Fund\nother than the management fee, brokerage\nexpenses, taxes, interest, fees and expenses\nof the Independent Trustees (including any\nTrustee's counsel fees), acquired fund fees\nand expenses, litigation expenses and other\nextraordinary expenses. The Adviser has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its\nmanagement fee and/or reimburse expenses in an\namount equal to any acquired fund fees and\nexpenses (excluding holdings in acquired funds\nfor cash management purposes, if any) for the\nFund until [ ]. This waiver and/or\nreimbursement does not provide for the\nrecoupment by the Adviser of any fees the\nAdviser previously waived. The Adviser may\ncontinue the waiver and/or reimbursement from\nyear to year, but there is no guarantee that\nthe Adviser will do so and the waiver and/or\nreimbursement may be cancelled or modified at\nany time after the end of its current term.\nThe waiver and/or reimbursement may not be\nterminated prior to the end of its current\nterm except with the approval of the Board.\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not pay\nfees to the Adviser for the past three fiscal\nyears. A summary of the factors considered by\nthe Board of Trustees in connection with the\ninitial approval of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement for the Fund will be available in\nthe Fund's annual report or semi-annual\nreport, as applicable, after the Fund\ncommences operations. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS The\nAdviser manages the Fund using a team of\ninvestment professionals. The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management of the Fund are Emiliano\nRabinovich, Juan Acevedo and Ted Janowsky. The\nfollowing table lists the number and types of\naccounts managed by each of the key\nprofessionals involved in the day-to-day\nportfolio management for the Fund and assets\nunder management in those accounts. The total\nnumber of accounts and assets have been\nallocated to each respective manager.\nTherefore, some accounts and assets have been\ncounted twice. Other Accounts Managed as of [\n]\n                                              \n  Po\u2026  Reg\u2026  As\u2026  Oth\u2026  As\u2026  Oth\u2026  As\u2026  Tot\u2026  \n  Ma\u2026             Poo\u2026                        \n  Em\u2026  [ ]   [ ]  [ ]   [ ]  [ ]   [ ]  [ ]   \n  Ra\u2026                                         \n  Ju\u2026  [ ]   [ ]  [ ]   [ ]  [ ]   [ ]  [ ]   \n  Ac\u2026                                         \n  Ted  [ ]   [ ]  [ ]   [ ]  [ ]   [ ]  [ ]   \n  Ja\u2026                                         \n                                              \n* There are no performance-based fees\nassociated with these accounts. The Fund had\nnot commenced operations prior to the date of\nthis SAI and therefore the portfolio managers\ndid not beneficially own any Shares. Conflicts\nof Interest. A portfolio manager that has\nresponsibility for managing more than one\naccount may be subject to potential conflicts\nof interest because he or she is responsible\nfor other accounts in addition to the Fund.\nThose conflicts could include preferential\ntreatment of one account over others in terms\nof: (a) the portfolio manager's execution of\ndifferent investment strategies for various\naccounts; or (b) the allocation of resources\nor of investment opportunities.\n\n31\n\nPortfolio managers may manage numerous\naccounts for multiple clients. These accounts\nmay include registered investment companies,\nother types of pooled accounts (e.g.,\ncollective investment funds), and separate\naccounts (i.e., accounts managed on behalf of\nindividuals or public or private\ninstitutions). Portfolio managers make\ninvestment decisions for each account based on\nthe investment objectives and policies and\nother relevant investment considerations\napplicable to that portfolio. A potential\nconflict of interest may arise as a result of\na portfolio manager's responsibility for\nmultiple accounts with similar investment\nguidelines. Under these circumstances, a\npotential investment may be suitable for more\nthan one of the portfolio manager's accounts,\nbut the quantity of the investment available\nfor purchase is less than the aggregate amount\nthe accounts would ideally devote to the\nopportunity. Similar conflicts may arise when\nmultiple accounts seek to dispose of the same\ninvestment. The portfolio managers may also\nmanage accounts whose objectives and policies\ndiffer from that of the Fund. These\ndifferences may be such that under certain\ncircumstances, trading activity appropriate\nfor one account managed by the portfolio\nmanager may have adverse consequences for\nanother account managed by the portfolio\nmanager. For example, an account may sell a\nsignificant position in a security, which\ncould cause the market price of that security\nto decrease, while the Fund maintained its\nposition in that security. A potential\nconflict may arise when the portfolio managers\nare responsible for accounts that have\ndifferent advisory fees\u2014 the difference in\nfees could create an incentive for the\nportfolio manager to favor one account over\nanother, for example, in terms of access to\ninvestment opportunities. This conflict may be\nheightened if an account is subject to a\nperformance-based fee, as applicable. Another\npotential conflict may arise when the\nportfolio manager has an investment in one or\nmore accounts that participate in transactions\nwith other accounts. His or her investment(s)\nmay create an incentive for the portfolio\nmanager to favor one account over another. The\nAdviser has adopted policies and procedures\nreasonably designed to address these potential\nmaterial conflicts. For instance, portfolio\nmanagers are normally responsible for all\naccounts within a certain investment\ndiscipline and do not, absent special\ncircumstances, differentiate among the various\naccounts when allocating resources.\nAdditionally, the Adviser and its advisory\naffiliates have processes and procedures for\nallocating investment opportunities among\nportfolios that are designed to provide a fair\nand equitable allocation. With respect to\nconflicts arising from personal investments,\nall employees, including portfolio managers,\nmust comply with personal trading controls\nestablished by each of the Adviser's and\nTrust's Code of Ethics. SSGA's culture is\ncomplemented and reinforced by a total rewards\nstrategy that is based on a pay for\nperformance philosophy which seeks to offer a\ncompetitive pay mix of base salary, benefits,\ncash incentives and deferred compensation.\nSalary is based on a number of factors,\nincluding external benchmarking data and\nmarket trends, and performance both at the\nbusiness and individual level. SSGA's Global\nHuman Resources department regularly\nparticipates in compensation surveys in order\nto provide SSGA with market-based compensation\ninformation that helps support individual pay\ndecisions. Additionally, subject to State\nStreet and SSGA business results, an incentive\npool is allocated to SSGA to reward its\nemployees. The size of the incentive pool for\nmost business units is based on the firm's\noverall profitability and other factors,\nincluding performance against risk-related\ngoals. For most SSGA investment teams, SSGA\nrecognizes and rewards performance by linking\nannual incentive decisions for investment\nteams to the firm's or business unit's\nprofitability and business unit investment\nperformance over a multi-year period.\nIncentive pool funding for most active\ninvestment teams is driven in part by the\npost-tax investment performance of fund(s)\nmanaged by the team versus the return levels\nof the benchmark index(es) of the fund(s) on a\none-, three- and, in some cases, five-year\nbasis. For most active investment teams, a\nmaterial portion of incentive compensation for\nsenior staff is deferred over a four-year\nperiod into the SSGA Long-Term Incentive ( \u201c\nSSGA LTI \u201d ) program. For these teams, The\nSSGA LTI program indexes the performance of\nthese deferred awards against the post-tax\ninvestment performance of fund(s) managed by\nthe team. This is intended to align our\ninvestment team's compensation with client\ninterests, both through annual incentive\ncompensation awards and through the long-term\nvalue of deferred awards in the SSGA LTI\nprogram. For the index equity investment team,\nincentive pool funding is driven in part by\nthe post-tax 1 and 3-year tracking error of\nthe funds managed by the team against the\nbenchmark indexes of the funds. The\ndiscretionary allocation of the incentive pool\nto the business units within SSGA is\ninfluenced by market-based compensation data,\nas well as the overall performance of each\nbusiness unit. Individual compensation\ndecisions are made by the employee's manager,\nin conjunction with the senior management of\nthe employee's business unit. These decisions\nare based on the overall performance of the\nemployee and, as mentioned above, on the\nperformance of the firm\n\n32\n\nand business unit. Depending on the job level,\na portion of the annual incentive may be\nawarded in deferred compensation, which may\ninclude cash and/or Deferred Stock Awards\n(State Street stock), which typically vest\nover a four-year period. This helps to retain\nstaff and further aligns SSGA employees'\ninterests with SSGA clients' and shareholders'\nlong-term interests. SSGA recognizes and\nrewards outstanding performance by: \u2022\nPromoting employee ownership to connect\nemployees directly to the company's success. \u2022\nUsing rewards to reinforce mission, vision,\nvalues and business strategy. \u2022 Seeking to\nrecognize and preserve the firm's unique\nculture and team orientation. \u2022 Providing all\nemployees the opportunity to share in the\nsuccess of SSGA.

THE\nDISTRIBUTOR State Street Global Advisors Funds\nDistributors, LLC is the principal underwriter\nand Distributor of Shares. Its principal\naddress is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. Investor information can\nbe obtained by calling 1-866-787-2257. The\nDistributor has entered into a distribution\nagreement ( \u201c Distribution Agreement \u201d ) with\nthe Trust pursuant to which it distributes\nShares of the Fund. The Distribution Agreement\nwill continue for two years from its effective\ndate and is\n\n33\n\nrenewable annually thereafter. Shares will be\ncontinuously offered for sale by the Trust\nthrough the Distributor only in Creation\nUnits, as described in the Prospectus and\nbelow under \u201c PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF\nCREATION UNITS. \u201d Shares in less than Creation\nUnits are not distributed by the Distributor.\nThe Distributor will deliver the Prospectus to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nand confirmations of acceptance furnished by\nit. The Distributor is a broker-dealer\nregistered under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (the \u201c Exchange Act \u201d )\nand a member of the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority ( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The\nDistributor has no role in determining the\ninvestment policies of the Trust or which\nsecurities are to be purchased or sold by the\nTrust. An affiliate of the Distributor may\nassist Authorized Participants (as defined\nbelow) in assembling shares to purchase\nCreation Units or upon redemption, for which\nit may receive commissions or other fees from\nsuch Authorized Participants. An affiliate of\nthe Distributor also receives compensation\nfrom State Street for providing on-line\ncreation and redemption functionality to\nAuthorized Participants through its Fund\nConnect application. The Adviser or\nDistributor, or an affiliate of the Adviser or\nDistributor, may directly or indirectly make\ncash payments to certain broker-dealers for\nparticipating in activities that are designed\nto make registered representatives and other\nprofessionals more knowledgeable about\nexchange-traded products, including the SPDR\nfunds, or for other activities, such as\nparticipation in marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems. In addition,\nas of the date of this SAI, the Adviser and/or\nDistributor had arrangements whereby they may\nmake payments, other than for the educational\nprograms and marketing activities described\nabove, to Pershing LLC ( \u201c Pershing \u201d ), RBC\nCapital Markets, LLC ( \u201c RBC \u201d ), LPL\nFinancial, LLC ( \u201c LPL \u201d ), and Morgan Stanley\nWealth Management, LLC. These amounts, which\nmay be significant, are paid by the Adviser\nand/or Distributor from their own resources\nand not from Fund assets. Pursuant to these\narrangements, Pershing, RBC and LPL have\nagreed to offer certain SPDR funds to their\ncustomers and not to charge certain of their\ncustomers any commissions when those customers\npurchase or sell shares of certain SPDR funds.\nPayments to a broker-dealer or intermediary\nmay create potential conflicts of interest\nbetween the broker dealer or intermediary and\nits clients. In addition, the Adviser or\nDistributor, or an affiliate of the Adviser or\nDistributor, as well as an index provider that\nis not affiliated with the Adviser or\nDistributor, may reimburse expenses or make\npayments from their own assets to other\npersons in consideration of services,\nprovision of data, or other activities that\nthey believe may benefit the SPDR business or\nfacilitate investment in SPDR funds. The\nDistribution Agreement provides that it may be\nterminated at any time, without the payment of\nany penalty, as to the Fund: (i) by vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees or (ii)\nby vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the outstanding voting securities of\nthe Fund, on at least 60 days' written notice\nto the Distributor. The Distribution Agreement\nis also terminable upon 60 days' notice by the\nDistributor and will terminate automatically\nin the event of its assignment (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act). The continuation of the\nDistribution Agreement and any other related\nagreements is subject to annual approval of\nthe Board, including by a majority of the\nIndependent Trustees, as described above. The\nallocation among the Trust's series of fees\nand expenses payable under the Distribution\nAgreement will be made pro rata in accordance\nwith the daily net assets of the respective\nseries. The Distributor may also enter into\nagreements with securities dealers ( \u201c\nSoliciting Dealers \u201d ) who will solicit\npurchases of Creation Unit aggregations of\nShares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be\nParticipating Parties (as defined in the \u201c\nBook Entry Only System \u201d section below) and/or\nDTC Participants (as defined below). Pursuant\nto the Distribution Agreement, the Trust has\nagreed to indemnify the Distributor, and may\nindemnify Soliciting Dealers and Authorized\nParticipants (as described below) entering\ninto agreements with the Distributor, for\ncertain liabilities, including certain\nliabilities arising under the federal\nsecurities laws, unless such loss or liability\nresults from willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence in the performance of its\nduties or the reckless disregard of its\nobligations and duties under the Distribution\nAgreement or other agreement, as applicable.\nBrokerage Transactions All portfolio\ntransactions are placed on behalf of the Fund\nby the Adviser. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities on a securities exchange are\naffected through brokers who charge a\ncommission for their services. Ordinarily\ncommissions are not charged on over-the-\ncounter orders (e.g., fixed income securities)\nbecause the Fund pays a spread which is\nincluded in the cost of the security and\nrepresents the difference between the dealer's\nquoted price at which it is willing to sell\nthe\n\n34\n\nsecurity and the dealer's quoted price at\nwhich it is willing to buy the security. When\nthe Fund executes an over-the-counter order\nwith an electronic communications network or\nan alternative trading system, a commission is\ncharged by such electronic communications\nnetworks and alternative trading systems as\nthey execute such orders on an agency basis.\nSecurities may be purchased from underwriters\nat prices that include underwriting fees. In\nplacing a portfolio transaction, the Adviser\nseeks to achieve best execution. The Adviser's\nduty to seek best execution requires the\nAdviser to take reasonable steps to obtain for\nthe client as favorable an overall result as\npossible for Fund portfolio transactions under\nthe circumstances, taking into account various\nfactors that are relevant to the particular\ntransaction. The Adviser refers to and selects\nfrom the list of approved trading\ncounterparties maintained by the Adviser's\nCredit Risk Management team. In selecting a\ntrading counterparty for a particular trade,\nthe Adviser seeks to weigh relevant factors\nincluding, but not limited to the following: \u2022\nPrompt and reliable execution; \u2022 The\ncompetitiveness of commission rates and\nspreads, if applicable; \u2022 The financial\nstrength, stability and/or reputation of the\ntrading counterparty; \u2022 The willingness and\nability of the executing trading counterparty\nto execute transactions (and commit capital)\nof size in liquid and illiquid markets without\ndisrupting the market for the security; \u2022\nLocal laws, regulations or restrictions; \u2022 The\nability of the trading counterparty to\nmaintain confidentiality; \u2022 The availability\nand capability of execution venues, including\nelectronic communications networks for trading\nand execution management systems made\navailable to Adviser; \u2022 Market share; \u2022\nLiquidity; \u2022 Price; \u2022 Execution related costs;\n\u2022 History of execution of orders; \u2022 Likelihood\nof execution and settlement; \u2022 Order size and\nnature; \u2022 Clearance and settlement\ncapabilities, especially in high volatility\nmarket environments; \u2022 Availability of\nlendable securities; \u2022 Sophistication of the\ntrading counterparty's trading capabilities\nand infrastructure/facilities; \u2022 The\noperational efficiency with which transactions\nare processed and cleared, taking into account\nthe order size and complexity; \u2022 Speed and\nresponsiveness to the Adviser; \u2022 Access to\nsecondary markets; \u2022 Counterparty exposure;\nand \u2022 Depending upon the circumstances, the\nAdviser may take other relevant factors into\naccount if the Adviser believes that these are\nimportant in taking all sufficient steps to\nobtain the best possible result for execution\nof the order. In selecting a trading\ncounterparty, the price of the transaction and\ncosts related to the execution of the\ntransaction typically merit a high relative\nimportance, depending on the circumstances.\nThe Adviser does not necessarily select a\ntrading counterparty based upon price and\ncosts but may take other relevant factors into\naccount if it believes that these are\nimportant in taking reasonable steps to obtain\nthe best possible result for the Fund under\nthe circumstances. Consequently, the Adviser\nmay cause a client to pay a trading\ncounterparty more than another trading\ncounterparty might have charged for the same\ntransaction in recognition of the value and\nquality of the brokerage services provided.\nThe following matters may influence the\nrelative importance that the Adviser places\nupon the relevant factors: (i) The nature and\ncharacteristics of the order or transaction.\nFor example, size of order, market impact of\norder, limits, or other instructions relating\nto the order;\n\n35\n\n(ii) The characteristics of the financial\ninstrument(s) or other assets which are the\nsubject of that order. For example, whether\nthe order pertains to an equity, fixed income,\nderivative or convertible instrument; (iii)\nThe characteristics of the execution venues to\nwhich that order can be directed, if relevant.\nFor example, availability and capabilities of\nelectronic trading systems; (iv) Whether the\ntransaction is a \u2018delivery versus payment' or\n\u2018over-the-counter' transaction. The\ncreditworthiness of the trading counterparty,\nthe amount of existing exposure to a trading\ncounterparty and trading counterparty\nsettlement capabilities may be given a higher\nrelative importance in the case of \u2018over-the-\ncounter' transactions; and/or (v) Any other\ncircumstances that the Adviser believes are\nrelevant at the time. The process by which\ntrading counterparties are selected to effect\ntransactions is designed to exclude\nconsideration of the sales efforts conducted\nby broker-dealers in relation to the Fund. The\nAdviser does not currently use the Fund's\nassets in connection with third-party soft\ndollar arrangements. While the Adviser does\nnot currently use \u201c soft \u201d or commission\ndollars paid by the Fund for the purchase of\nthird-party research, the Adviser reserves the\nright to do so in the future. The Fund had not\ncommenced operations as of the date of this\nSAI and therefore did not pay brokerage\ncommissions during the past three fiscal\nyears. Securities of \u201c Regular Broker-Dealers\n\u201d : The Trust is required to identify any\nsecurities of its \u201c regular brokers and\ndealers \u201d (as such term is defined in the 1940\nAct) which it may hold at the close of its\nmost recent fiscal year. \u201c Regular brokers or\ndealers \u201d of the Trust are the ten brokers or\ndealers that, during the most recent fiscal\nyear: (i) received the greatest dollar amounts\nof brokerage commissions from the Trust's\nportfolio transactions; (ii) engaged as\nprincipal in the largest dollar amounts of\nportfolio transactions of the Trust; or (iii)\nsold the largest dollar amounts of the Trust's\nshares. The Fund had not commenced operations\nas of the date of this SAI and therefore did\nnot have any holdings in Securities of Regular\nBroker-Dealers as of June 30, 2023. Portfolio\nTurnover: Portfolio turnover may vary from\nyear to year, as well as within a year. The\nFund may experience higher portfolio turnover\nwhen migrating to a different benchmark index.\nHigh turnover rates are likely to result in\ncomparatively greater brokerage expenses or\ntransaction costs. The overall reasonableness\nof brokerage commissions and transaction costs\nis evaluated by the Adviser based upon its\nknowledge of available information as to the\ngeneral level of commissions and transaction\ncosts paid by other institutional investors\nfor comparable services. Book Entry Only\nSystem The following information supplements\nand should be read in conjunction with the\nsection in the Prospectus entitled \u201c\nADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d\nThe Depository Trust Company ( \u201c DTC \u201d ) acts\nas securities depositary for the Shares.\nShares of the Fund are represented by\nsecurities registered in the name of DTC or\nits nominee, Cede & Co., and deposited with,\nor on behalf of, DTC. Except in the limited\ncircumstance provided below, certificates will\nnot be issued for Shares. DTC, a limited-\npurpose trust company, was created to hold\nsecurities of its participants (the \u201c DTC\nParticipants \u201d ) and to facilitate the\nclearance and settlement of securities\ntransactions among the DTC Participants in\nsuch securities through electronic book-entry\nchanges in accounts of the DTC Participants,\nthereby eliminating the need for physical\nmovement of securities certificates. DTC\nParticipants include securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and certain other organizations,\nsome of whom (and/or their representatives)\nown DTC. More specifically, DTC is owned by a\nnumber of its DTC Participants and by the New\nYork Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) and FINRA.\nAccess to the DTC system is also available to\nothers such as banks, brokers, dealers and\ntrust companies that clear through or maintain\na custodial relationship with a DTC\nParticipant, either directly or indirectly\n(the \u201c Indirect Participants \u201d ). Beneficial\nownership of Shares is limited to DTC\nParticipants, Indirect Participants and\npersons holding interests through DTC\nParticipants and Indirect Participants.\nOwnership of beneficial interests in Shares\n(owners of such beneficial interests are\nreferred to herein as \u201c Beneficial Owners \u201d )\nis shown on, and the transfer of ownership is\neffected only through, records maintained by\nDTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on\nthe records of DTC Participants (with respect\nto Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of Shares.\n\n36\n\nConveyance of all notices, statements and\nother communications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the Shares of the\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust,\neither directly or through a third party\nservice, shall inquire of each such DTC\nParticipant as to the number of Beneficial\nOwners holding Shares, directly or indirectly,\nthrough such DTC Participant. The Trust,\neither directly or through a third party\nservice, shall provide each such DTC\nParticipant with copies of such notice,\nstatement or other communication, in such\nform, number and at such place as such DTC\nParticipant may reasonably request, in order\nthat such notice, statement or communication\nmay be transmitted by such DTC Participant,\ndirectly or indirectly, to such Beneficial\nOwners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to\neach such DTC Participant and/or third party\nservice a fair and reasonable amount as\nreimbursement for the expenses attendant to\nsuch transmittal, all subject to applicable\nstatutory and regulatory requirements. Share\ndistributions shall be made to DTC or its\nnominee, Cede & Co., as the registered holder\nof all Shares. DTC or its nominee, upon\nreceipt of any such distributions, shall\ncredit immediately DTC Participants' accounts\nwith payments in amounts proportionate to\ntheir respective beneficial interests in\nShares of the Fund as shown on the records of\nDTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC\nParticipants to Indirect Participants and\nBeneficial Owners of Shares held through such\nDTC Participants will be governed by standing\ninstructions and customary practices, as is\nnow the case with securities held for the\naccounts of customers in bearer form or\nregistered in a \u201c street name, \u201d and will be\nthe responsibility of such DTC Participants.\nThe Trust has no responsibility or liability\nfor any aspects of the records relating to or\nnotices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made\non account of beneficial ownership interests\nin such Shares, or for maintaining,\nsupervising or reviewing any records relating\nto such beneficial ownership interests or for\nany other aspect of the relationship between\nDTC and the DTC Participants or the\nrelationship between such DTC Participants and\nthe Indirect Participants and Beneficial\nOwners owning through such DTC Participants.\nDTC may determine to discontinue providing its\nservice with respect to Shares at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action\neither to find a replacement for DTC to\nperform its functions at a comparable cost or,\nif such a replacement is unavailable, to issue\nand deliver printed certificates representing\nownership of Shares, unless the Trust makes\nother arrangements with respect thereto\nsatisfactory to the Exchange. Control Persons\nand Principal Holders of Securities The Fund\nhad not commenced operations prior to the date\nof this SAI and therefore did not have any\nbeneficial owners that owned greater than 5%\nof the outstanding voting securities as of the\ndate of this SAI. An Authorized Participant\n(as defined below) may hold of record more\nthan 25% of the outstanding Shares. From time\nto time, Authorized Participants may be a\nbeneficial and/or legal owner of the Fund, may\nbe affiliated with an index provider, may be\ndeemed to have control of the Fund and/or may\nbe able to affect the outcome of matters\npresented for a vote of the shareholders of\nthe Fund. Authorized Participants may execute\nan irrevocable proxy granting the Distributor\nor another affiliate of State Street (the \u201c\nAgent \u201d ) power to vote or abstain from voting\nsuch Authorized Participant's beneficially or\nlegally owned Shares. In such cases, the Agent\nshall mirror vote (or abstain from voting)\nsuch Shares in the same proportion as all\nother beneficial owners of the Fund. The\nTrustees and Officers of the Trust, as a\ngroup, own less than 1% of the Trust's voting\nsecurities as of the date of this SAI.\nPurchase and Redemption of Creation Units The\nFund issues and redeems its Shares on a\ncontinuous basis, at net asset value, only in\na large specified number of Shares called a \u201c\nCreation Unit. \u201d The value of the Fund is\ndetermined once each business day as described\nunder \u201c Determination of Net Asset Value. \u201d\nThe Creation Unit size for the Fund may\nchange. Authorized Participants (as defined\nbelow) will be notified of such change. The\nprincipal consideration for creations and\nredemptions for the Fund is in-kind, although\nthis may be revised at any time without\nnotice.\n\n37\n\nPURCHASE (CREATION) The Trust issues and sells\nShares of the Fund only: in Creation Units on\na continuous basis through the Principal\nUnderwriter, without a sales load (but subject\nto transaction fees), at their NAV per share\nnext determined after receipt of an order, on\nany Business Day (as defined below), in proper\nform pursuant to the terms of the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement ( \u201c Participant\nAgreement \u201d ). A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect\nto the Fund is, generally, any day on which\nthe NYSE is open for business. FUND DEPOSIT\nThe consideration for purchase of a Creation\nUnit of the Fund generally consists of either\n(i) the Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent (defined below), computed as\ndescribed below or (ii) the cash value of the\nDeposit Securities and the \u201c Cash Component, \u201d\ncomputed as described below. When accepting\npurchases of Creation Units for cash, the Fund\nmay incur additional costs associated with the\nacquisition of Deposit Securities that would\notherwise be provided by an in-kind purchaser.\nTogether, the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, and the Cash Component\nconstitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d which\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent\ninvestment amount for a Creation Unit of the\nFund. The \u201c Cash Component, \u201d which may\ninclude a Dividend Equivalent Payment, is an\namount equal to the difference between the net\nasset value of the Shares (per Creation Unit)\nand the market value of the Deposit Securities\nor Deposit Cash, as applicable. The \u201c Dividend\nEquivalent Payment \u201d enables the Fund to make\na complete distribution of dividends on the\nday preceding the next dividend payment date,\nand is an amount equal, on a per Creation Unit\nbasis, to the dividends on all the portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund ( \u201c Dividend Securities\n\u201d ) with ex-dividend dates within the\naccumulation period for such distribution (the\n\u201c Accumulation Period \u201d ), net of expenses and\nliabilities for such period, as if all of the\nDividend Securities had been held by the Fund\nfor the entire Accumulation Period. The\nAccumulation Period begins on the ex-dividend\ndate for the Fund and ends on the day\npreceding the next ex-dividend date. If the\nCash Component is a positive number (i.e., the\nnet asset value per Creation Unit exceeds the\nmarket value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash\nComponent shall be such positive amount. If\nthe Cash Component is a negative number (i.e.,\nthe net asset value per Creation Unit is less\nthan the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable),\nthe Cash Component shall be such negative\namount and the creator will be entitled to\nreceive cash in an amount equal to the Cash\nComponent. The Cash Component serves the\nfunction of compensating for any differences\nbetween the net asset value per Creation Unit\nand the market value of the Deposit Securities\nor Deposit Cash, as applicable. Computation of\nthe Cash Component excludes any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities, if applicable, which shall\nbe the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below). The Custodian,\nthrough NSCC, makes available on each Business\nDay, prior to the opening of business on the\nExchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern time),\nthe list of the names and the required number\nof shares of each Deposit Security or the\nrequired amount of Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, to be included in the current\nstandard Fund Deposit (based on information at\nthe end of the previous Business Day) for the\nFund. Such standard Fund Deposit is subject to\nany applicable adjustments as described below,\nin order to effect purchases of Creation Units\nof the Fund until such time as the next-\nannounced composition of the Deposit\nSecurities or the required amount of Deposit\nCash, as applicable, is made available. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Deposit\nSecurities or the amount of Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, required for a Fund Deposit for\nthe Fund may be changed from time to time with\na view to the investment objective of the\nFund. Information regarding a Fund Deposit\nnecessary for the purchase of a Creation Unit\nis made available to Authorized Participants\nand other market participants seeking to\ntransact in Creation Unit aggregations. As\nnoted above, the Trust reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit\nCash to replace any Deposit Security, which\nshall be added to the Cash Component,\nincluding, without limitation, in situations\nwhere the Deposit Security: (i) may not be\navailable in sufficient quantity for delivery,\n(ii) may not be eligible for transfer through\nthe systems of DTC for corporate securities\nand municipal securities or the Federal\nReserve System for U.S. Treasury securities;\n(iii) may not be eligible for trading by an\nAuthorized Participant (as defined below) or\nthe investor for which it is acting; (iv)\nwould be restricted under the securities laws\nor where the delivery of the Deposit Security\nto the Authorized Participant would result in\nthe disposition of the Deposit Security by the\nAuthorized Participant becoming restricted\nunder the securities laws, or (v) in certain\nother situations (collectively, \u201c non-standard\norders \u201d ). The Trust also reserves the right\nto: (i) permit or require the substitution of\nDeposit Securities in lieu of Deposit Cash;\nand (ii) include or remove Deposit\n\n38\n\nSecurities from the basket in anticipation of\nportfolio changes. The adjustments described\nabove will reflect changes, known to the\nAdviser on the date of announcement to be in\neffect by the time of delivery of the Fund\nDeposit, in the composition of the subject\nIndex being tracked by the Fund or resulting\nfrom certain corporate actions. PROCEDURES FOR\nPURCHASE OF CREATION UNITS To be eligible to\nplace orders with the Principal Underwriter,\nas facilitated via the Transfer Agent, to\npurchase a Creation Unit of the Fund, an\nentity must be (i) a \u201c Participating Party \u201d ,\ni.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in\nthe clearing process through the Continuous\nNet Settlement System of the NSCC (the \u201c\nClearing Process \u201d ), a clearing agency that\nis registered with the SEC; or (ii) a DTC\nParticipant (see \u201c Book Entry Only System \u201d ),\nand must have the ability to clear through the\nFederal Reserve System. In addition, each\nParticipating Party or DTC Participant (each,\nan \u201c Authorized Participant \u201d ) must execute a\nParticipant Agreement that has been agreed to\nby the Principal Underwriter and the Transfer\nAgent, and that has been accepted by the\nTrust, with respect to purchases and\nredemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized\nParticipant will agree, pursuant to the terms\nof a Participant Agreement, on behalf of\nitself or any investor on whose behalf it will\nact, to certain conditions, including that it\nwill pay to the Trust, an amount of cash\nsufficient to pay the Cash Component together\nwith the creation transaction fee (described\nbelow) and any other applicable fees, taxes\nand additional variable charge. All orders to\npurchase Shares directly from the Fund,\nincluding non-standard orders, must be placed\nfor one or more Creation Units and in the\nmanner and by the time set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement and/or the applicable\norder form. The date on which an order to\npurchase Creation Units (or an order to redeem\nCreation Units, as set forth below) is\nreceived and accepted is referred to as the \u201c\nOrder Placement Date. \u201d An Authorized\nParticipant may require an investor to make\ncertain representations or enter into\nagreements with respect to the order (e.g., to\nprovide for payments of cash, when required).\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not have executed a\nParticipant Agreement and that, therefore,\norders to purchase Shares directly from the\nFund in Creation Units have to be placed by\nthe investor's broker through an Authorized\nParticipant that has executed a Participant\nAgreement. In such cases there may be\nadditional charges to such investor. At any\ngiven time, there may be only a limited number\nof broker-dealers that have executed a\nParticipant Agreement and only a small number\nof such Authorized Participants may have\ninternational capabilities. On days when the\nExchange or the bond markets close earlier\nthan normal, the Fund may require orders to\ncreate Creation Units to be placed earlier in\nthe day. In addition, if a market or markets\non which the Fund's investments are primarily\ntraded is closed, the Fund will also generally\nnot accept orders on such day(s). Orders must\nbe transmitted by an Authorized Participant by\ntelephone or other transmission method\nacceptable to the Distributor pursuant to\nprocedures set forth in the Participant\nAgreement and in accordance with the\napplicable order form. Those placing orders\nthrough an Authorized Participant should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe purchase order by the cut-off time.\nEconomic or market disruptions or changes, or\ntelephone or other communication failure may\nimpede the ability to reach the Distributor or\nan Authorized Participant. Fund Deposits must\nbe delivered by an Authorized Participant\nthrough the Federal Reserve System (for cash\nand U.S. government securities), or through\nDTC (for corporate securities and municipal\nsecurities), through a subcustody agent (for\nforeign securities) and/or through such other\narrangements allowed by the Trust or its\nagents. With respect to foreign Deposit\nSecurities, the Custodian shall cause the\nsubcustodian of the Fund to maintain an\naccount into which the Authorized Participant\nshall deliver, on behalf of itself or the\nparty on whose behalf it is acting, such\nDeposit Securities. Foreign Deposit Securities\nmust be delivered to an account maintained at\nthe applicable local subcustodian. The Fund\nDeposit transfer must be ordered by the\nAuthorized Participant in a timely fashion so\nas to ensure the delivery of the requisite\nnumber of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash,\nas applicable, to the account of the Fund or\nits agents by no later than the Settlement\nDate. The \u201c Settlement Date \u201d for the Fund is\ngenerally the second Business Day ( \u201c T+2 \u201d )\nafter the Order Placement Date. All questions\nas to the number of Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash to be delivered, as applicable,\nand the validity, form and eligibility\n(including time of receipt) for the deposit of\nany tendered securities or cash, as\napplicable, will be determined by the Trust,\nwhose determination shall be final and\nbinding. The amount of cash represented by the\nCash Component must be transferred directly to\nthe Custodian through the Federal Reserve Bank\nwire transfer system in a timely manner so as\nto be received by the Custodian no later than\nthe Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and\nthe Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, are not received in a timely\nmanner by the Settlement Date, the creation\norder may be cancelled. Upon written notice to\nthe Distributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the\n\n39\n\nfollowing Business Day using a Fund Deposit as\nnewly constituted to reflect the then current\nNAV of the Fund. The delivery of Creation\nUnits so created generally will occur no later\nthan the second Business Day following the day\non which the purchase order is deemed received\nby the Distributor. The order shall be deemed\nto be received on the Business Day on which\nthe order is placed provided that the order is\nplaced in proper form prior to the applicable\ncut-off time and the federal funds in the\nappropriate amount are deposited by 2:00 p.m.\nor 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions), with the Custodian on the\nSettlement Date. If the order is not placed in\nproper form as required, or federal funds in\nthe appropriate amount are not received by\n2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per\napplicable instructions) on the Settlement\nDate, then the order may be deemed to be\nrejected and the Authorized Participant shall\nbe liable to the Fund for losses, if any,\nresulting therefrom. A creation request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if all\nprocedures set forth in the Participant\nAgreement, order form and this SAI are\nproperly followed. ISSUANCE OF A CREATION UNIT\nExcept as provided herein, Creation Units will\nnot be issued until the transfer of good title\nto the Trust of the Deposit Securities or\npayment of Deposit Cash, as applicable, and\nthe payment of the Cash Component have been\ncompleted. When the subcustodian has confirmed\nto the Custodian that the required Deposit\nSecurities (or the cash value thereof) have\nbeen delivered to the account of the relevant\nsubcustodian or subcustodians, the Principal\nUnderwriter and the Adviser shall be notified\nof such delivery, and the Trust will issue and\ncause the delivery of the Creation Units. In\ninstances where the Trust accepts Deposit\nSecurities for the purchase of a Creation\nUnit, the Creation Unit may be purchased in\nadvance of receipt by the Trust of all or a\nportion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nas described below. In these circumstances,\nthe initial deposit will have a value greater\nthan the net asset value of the Shares on the\ndate the order is placed in proper form since\nin addition to available Deposit Securities,\ncash must be deposited in an amount equal to\nthe sum of (i) the Cash Component, plus (ii)\nan additional amount of cash equal to a\npercentage of the market value as set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, of the undelivered\nDeposit Securities (the \u201c Additional Cash\nDeposit \u201d ), which shall be maintained in a\ngeneral non-interest bearing collateral\naccount. An additional amount of cash shall be\nrequired to be deposited with the Trust,\npending delivery of the missing Deposit\nSecurities to the extent necessary to maintain\nthe Additional Cash Deposit with the Trust in\nan amount at least equal to the applicable\npercentage, as set forth in the Participant\nAgreement, of the daily marked to market value\nof the missing Deposit Securities. The Trust\nmay use such Additional Cash Deposit to buy\nthe missing Deposit Securities at any time.\nAuthorized Participants will be liable to the\nTrust for all costs, expenses, dividends,\nincome and taxes associated with missing\nDeposit Securities, including the costs\nincurred by the Trust in connection with any\nsuch purchases. These costs will be deemed to\ninclude the amount by which the actual\npurchase price of the Deposit Securities\nexceeds the market value of such Deposit\nSecurities on the day the purchase order was\ndeemed received by the Principal Underwriter\nplus the brokerage and related transaction\ncosts associated with such purchases. The\nTrust will return any unused portion of the\nAdditional Cash Deposit once all of the\nmissing Deposit Securities have been properly\nreceived by the Custodian or purchased by the\nTrust and deposited into the Trust. In\naddition, a transaction fee as set forth below\nunder \u201c Creation Transaction Fees \u201d will be\ncharged in all cases and an additional\nvariable charge may also be applied. The\ndelivery of Creation Units so created\ngenerally will occur no later than the\nSettlement Date. ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF\nCREATION UNITS The Trust reserves the right to\nreject an order for Creation Units transmitted\nin respect of the Fund at its discretion,\nincluding, without limitation, if (a) the\norder is not in proper form or the Deposit\nSecurities delivered do not consist of the\nsecurities that the Custodian specified; (b)\nthe Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, delivered by the Authorized\nParticipant are not as disseminated through\nthe facilities of the NSCC for that date by\nthe Custodian; (c) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the Shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding Shares of\nthe Fund; (d) the acceptance of the Fund\nDeposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be\nunlawful; (e) the acceptance or receipt of the\norder for a Creation Unit would, in the\nopinion of counsel to the Trust, be unlawful;\nor (f) in the event that circumstances outside\nthe control of the Trust, the Custodian, the\nTransfer Agent, the Distributor and/or the\nAdviser make it for all practical purposes not\nfeasible to process orders for Creation Units.\nExamples of such circumstances include acts of\nGod or public service or utility problems such\nas fires, floods, extreme weather conditions\nand power outages resulting in telephone,\ntelecopy and computer failures; market\nconditions or activities causing trading\nhalts; systems failures involving computer or\nother information systems affecting the Trust,\nthe Principal Underwriter, the Custodian, the\nTransfer Agent, DTC, NSCC, Federal Reserve\nSystem, or any other participant in the\ncreation process, and other extraordinary\nevents. The Trust or its agents shall\ncommunicate to the Authorized Participant its\nrejection of an order. The Trust, the Transfer\n\n40\n\nAgent, the Custodian and the Principal\nUnderwriter are under no duty, however, to\ngive notification of any defects or\nirregularities in the delivery of Fund\nDeposits nor shall either of them incur any\nliability for the failure to give any such\nnotification. The Trust, the Transfer Agent,\nthe Custodian and the Principal Underwriter\nshall not be liable for the rejection of any\npurchase order for Creation Units. Given the\nimportance of the ongoing issuance of Creation\nUnits to maintaining a market price that is at\nor close to the underlying net asset value of\nthe Fund, the Trust does not intend to suspend\nacceptance of orders for Creation Units. All\nquestions as to the number of shares of each\nsecurity in the Deposit Securities and the\nvalidity, form, eligibility and acceptance for\ndeposit of any securities to be delivered\nshall be determined by the Trust, and the\nTrust's determination shall be final and\nbinding. REDEMPTION Shares may be redeemed\nonly in Creation Units at their net asset\nvalue next determined after receipt of a\nredemption request in proper form by the Fund\nthrough the Transfer Agent and only on a\nBusiness Day. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE\nFUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN\nAMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION UNITS. Investors\nmust accumulate enough Shares in the secondary\nmarket to constitute a Creation Unit in order\nto have such Shares redeemed by the Trust.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that there\nwill be sufficient liquidity in the public\ntrading market at any time to permit assembly\nof a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to\nincur brokerage and other costs in connection\nwith assembling a sufficient number of Shares\nto constitute a redeemable Creation Unit. With\nrespect to the Fund, the Custodian, through\nthe NSCC, makes available prior to the opening\nof business on the Exchange (currently 9:30\na.m. Eastern time) on each Business Day, the\nlist of the names and share quantities of\nsecurities designated by the Fund that will be\napplicable (subject to possible amendment or\ncorrection) to redemption requests received in\nproper form (as defined below) on that day ( \u201c\nRedemption Securities \u201d ). Redemption\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit Securities. The identity\nand number of shares of the Redemption\nSecurities or the Cash Redemption Amount\n(defined below) may be changed from time to\ntime with a view to the investment objective\nof the Fund. Redemption proceeds for a\nCreation Unit are paid either in-kind or in\ncash, or a combination thereof, as determined\nby the Trust. With respect to in-kind\nredemptions of the Fund, redemption proceeds\nfor a Creation Unit will consist of Redemption\nSecurities plus cash in an amount equal to the\ndifference between the net asset value of the\nFund Shares being redeemed, as next determined\nafter a receipt of a request in proper form,\nand the value of the Redemption Securities\n(the \u201c Cash Redemption Amount \u201d ), less a\nfixed redemption transaction fee and any\napplicable additional variable charge as set\nforth below. In the event that the Redemption\nSecurities have a value greater than the net\nasset value of the Fund Shares, a compensating\ncash payment equal to the differential is\nrequired to be made by or through an\nAuthorized Participant by the redeeming\nshareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at\nthe Trust's discretion, an Authorized\nParticipant may receive the corresponding cash\nvalue of the securities in lieu of the in-kind\nsecurities value representing one or more\nRedemption Securities. PROCEDURES FOR\nREDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS After the Trust\nhas deemed an order for redemption received,\nthe Trust will initiate procedures to transfer\nthe requisite Redemption Securities and the\nCash Redemption Amount to the Authorized\nParticipant by the Settlement Date. With\nrespect to in-kind redemptions of the Fund,\nthe calculation of the value of the Redemption\nSecurities and the Cash Redemption Amount to\nbe delivered upon redemption will be made by\nthe Custodian according to the procedures set\nforth under \u201c Determination of Net Asset Value\n\u201d , computed on the Business Day on which a\nredemption order is deemed received by the\nTrust. Therefore, if a redemption order in\nproper form is submitted to the Principal\nUnderwriter by a DTC Participant by the\nspecified time on the Order Placement Date,\nand the requisite number of Shares of the Fund\nare delivered to the Custodian prior to 2:00\np.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, then the\nvalue of the Redemption Securities and the\nCash Redemption Amount to be delivered will be\ndetermined by the Custodian on such Order\nPlacement Date. If the requisite number of\nShares of the Fund are not delivered by 2:00\np.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, the Fund\nwill not release the underlying securities for\ndelivery unless collateral is posted in such\npercentage amount of missing Shares as set\nforth in the Participant Agreement (marked to\nmarket daily).\n\n41\n\nWith respect to in-kind redemptions of the\nFund, in connection with taking delivery of\nshares of Redemption Securities upon\nredemption of Creation Units, an Authorized\nParticipant must maintain appropriate custody\narrangements with a qualified broker-dealer,\nbank or other custody providers in each\njurisdiction in which any of the Redemption\nSecurities are customarily traded (or such\nother arrangements as allowed by the Trust or\nits agents), to which account such Redemption\nSecurities will be delivered. Deliveries of\nredemption proceeds generally will be made\nwithin two Business Days of the trade date.\nDue to the schedule of holidays in certain\ncountries, however, the delivery of in-kind\nredemption proceeds may take longer than two\nBusiness Days after the day on which the\nredemption request is received in proper form.\nIf the Authorized Participant has not made\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nthe Redemption Securities in the applicable\nforeign jurisdiction and it is not possible to\nmake other such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of the\nRedemption Securities in such jurisdiction,\nthe Trust may, in its discretion, exercise its\noption to redeem such Shares in cash, and the\nAuthorized Participant will be required to\nreceive its redemption proceeds in cash. If it\nis not possible to make other such\narrangements, or if it is not possible to\neffect deliveries of the Redemption\nSecurities, the Trust may in its discretion\nexercise its option to redeem such Shares in\ncash, and the redeeming investor will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in\ncash. In addition, an investor may request a\nredemption in cash that the Fund may, in its\nsole discretion, permit. In either case, the\ninvestor will receive a cash payment equal to\nthe NAV of its Shares based on the NAV of\nShares of the Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charge for requested cash\nredemptions specified above, to offset the\nTrust's brokerage and other transaction costs\nassociated with the disposition of Redemption\nSecurities). The Fund may also, in its sole\ndiscretion, upon request of a shareholder,\nprovide such redeemer a portfolio of\nsecurities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Redemption Securities but\ndoes not differ in net asset value. An\nAuthorized Participant submitting a redemption\nrequest is deemed to represent to the Trust\nthat, as of the close of the Business Day on\nwhich the redemption request was submitted, it\n(or its client) will own (within the meaning\nof Rule 200 of Regulation SHO) or has arranged\nto borrow for delivery to the Trust on or\nprior to the Settlement Date of the redemption\nrequest, the requisite number of Shares of the\nFund to be redeemed as a Creation Unit. In\neither case, the Authorized Participant is\ndeemed to acknowledge that: (i) it (or its\nclient) has full legal authority and legal\nright to tender for redemption the requisite\nnumber of Shares of the Fund and to receive\nthe entire proceeds of the redemption; and\n(ii) if such Shares submitted for redemption\nhave been loaned or pledged to another party\nor are the subject of a repurchase agreement,\nsecurities lending agreement or any other\narrangement affecting legal or beneficial\nownership of such Shares being tendered, there\nare no restrictions precluding the tender and\ndelivery of such Shares (including borrowed\nshares, if any) for redemption, free and clear\nof liens, on the redemption Settlement Date.\nThe Trust reserves the right to verify these\nrepresentations at its discretion, but will\ntypically require verification with respect to\na redemption request from the Fund in\nconnection with higher levels of redemption\nactivity and/or short interest in the Fund. If\nthe Authorized Participant, upon receipt of a\nverification request, does not provide\nsufficient verification of its representations\nas determined by the Trust, the redemption\nrequest will not be considered to have been\nreceived in proper form and may be rejected by\nthe Trust. Redemptions of Shares for\nRedemption Securities will be subject to\ncompliance with applicable federal and state\nsecurities laws and the Fund (whether or not\nit otherwise permits cash redemptions)\nreserves the right to redeem Creation Units\nfor cash to the extent that the Trust could\nnot lawfully deliver specific Redemption\nSecurities upon redemptions or could not do so\nwithout first registering the Redemption\nSecurities under such laws. An Authorized\nParticipant or an investor for which it is\nacting subject to a legal restriction with\nrespect to a particular security included in\nthe Redemption Securities applicable to the\nredemption of Creation Units may be paid an\nequivalent amount of cash. The Authorized\nParticipant may request the redeeming investor\nof the Shares to complete an order form or to\nenter into agreements with respect to such\nmatters as compensating cash payment. Further,\nan Authorized Participant that is not a \u201c\nqualified institutional buyer, \u201d ( \u201c QIB \u201d )\nas such term is defined under Rule 144A of the\nSecurities Act, will not be able to receive\nRedemption Securities that are restricted\nsecurities eligible for resale under Rule\n144A. An Authorized Participant may be\nrequired by the Trust to provide a written\nconfirmation with respect to QIB status in\norder to receive Redemption Securities. The\nright of redemption may be suspended or the\ndate of payment postponed with respect to the\nFund (1) for any period during which the\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (2) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Exchange is\nsuspended or restricted; (3) for any period\nduring which an emergency exists as a result\nof which disposal of the Shares of the Fund or\ndetermination of the NAV of the Shares is not\nreasonably practicable; or (4) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\n\n42\n\nCREATION AND REDEMPTION TRANSACTION FEES A\ntransaction fee, as set forth in the table\nbelow, is imposed for the transfer and other\ntransaction costs associated with the purchase\nor redemption of Creation Units, as\napplicable. Authorized Participants will be\nrequired to pay a fixed creation transaction\nfee and/or a fixed redemption transaction fee,\nas applicable, on a given day regardless of\nthe number of Creation Units created or\nredeemed on that day. The Fund may adjust the\ntransaction fee from time to time. An\nadditional charge or a variable charge\n(discussed below) will be applied to certain\ncreation and redemption transactions,\nincluding non-standard orders and whole or\npartial cash purchases or redemptions. With\nrespect to creation orders, Authorized\nParticipants are responsible for the costs of\ntransferring the securities constituting the\nDeposit Securities to the account of the Trust\nand with respect to redemption orders,\nAuthorized Participants are responsible for\nthe costs of transferring the Redemption\nSecurities from the Trust to their account or\non their order. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other such intermediary may\nalso be charged a fee for such services.\nCreation and Redemption Transaction Fees:\n                                              \n  Fund          TransactionF\u2026  MaximumTrans\u2026  \n  SPDR                                        \n  Portfolio                                   \n  S&P Sector    $[ ]           $[ ]           \n  Neutral                                     \n  Dividend ETF                                \n                                              \n* From time to time, the Fund may waive all or\na portion of its applicable transaction\nfee(s). An additional charge of up to three\n(3) times the standard transaction fee may be\ncharged to the extent a transaction is outside\nof the clearing process. ** In addition to the\ntransaction fees listed above, the Fund may\ncharge an additional variable fee for\ncreations and redemptions in cash to offset\nbrokerage and impact expenses associated with\nthe cash transaction. The variable transaction\nfee will be calculated based on historical\ntransaction cost data and the Adviser's view\nof current market conditions; however, the\nactual variable fee charged for a given\ntransaction may be lower or higher than the\ntrading expenses incurred by the Fund with\nrespect to that transaction. Determination of\nNet Asset Value The following information\nsupplements and should be read in conjunction\nwith the sections in the Prospectus entitled \u201c\nPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION \u201d and \u201c\nADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d\nNAV per Share for the Fund is computed by\ndividing the value of the net assets of the\nFund (i.e., the value of its total assets less\ntotal liabilities) by the total number of\nShares outstanding. Expenses and fees,\nincluding the management fees, are accrued\ndaily and taken into account for purposes of\ndetermining NAV. The NAV of the Fund is\ncalculated by State Street and determined once\ndaily as of the close of the regular trading\nsession on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m.\nEastern time) on each day that such exchange\nis open. Creation/redemption order cut-off\ntimes may be earlier on any day that the\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation (or applicable exchange or market\non which the Fund's investments are traded)\nannounces an early closing time. Any assets or\nliabilities denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S.\ndollars at market rates on the date of\nvaluation (generally as of 4:00 p.m. London\ntime) as quoted by one or more sources. In\ncalculating the Fund's net asset value per\nShare, the Fund's investments are generally\nvalued using market valuations. A market\nvaluation generally means a valuation (i)\nobtained from an exchange, a pricing service,\nor a major market maker (or dealer) or (ii)\nbased on a price quotation or other equivalent\nindication of value supplied by an exchange, a\npricing service, or a major market maker (or\ndealer). The Fund relies on a third-party\nservice provider for assistance with the daily\ncalculation of the Fund's NAV. The third-party\nservice provider, in turn, relies on other\nparties for certain pricing data and other\ninputs used in the calculation of the Fund's\nNAV. Therefore, the Fund is subject to certain\noperational risks associated with reliance on\nits service provider and that service\nprovider's sources of pricing and other data.\nNAV calculation may be adversely affected by\noperational risks arising from factors such as\nerrors or failures in systems and technology.\nSuch errors or failures may result in\ninaccurately calculated NAVs, delays in the\ncalculation of NAVs and/or the inability to\ncalculate NAV over extended time periods. The\nFund may be unable to recover any losses\nassociated with such failures. In the case of\nshares of other funds that are not traded on\nan exchange, a market valuation means such\nfund's published net asset value per share.\nThe Fund may use various pricing services, or\ndiscontinue the use of any pricing service.\nFixed-income assets are generally valued as of\nthe announced closing time for trading in\nfixed-income instruments in a particular\nmarket or exchange, and generally 4:00 p.m.\nEST for U.S. fixed-income assets. Fixed-income\nassets are generally valued at the mean of the\nbid and ask prices for bank loans and\ninflation protected securities, and at the bid\nprice for all other fixed-income assets.\n\n43\n\nPursuant to Board approved valuation\nprocedures, the Board has designated the\nAdviser as the valuation designee for the\nFund. These procedures address, among other\nthings, (i) determining (a) when market\nquotations are not readily available or\nreliable and (b) the methodologies to be used\nfor determining the fair value of investments,\nand (ii) the use and oversight of third-party\npricing services for fair valuation. The\nAdviser is responsible for periodically\nreviewing the procedures, and the selected\nmethodologies used, for their continuing\nappropriateness and accuracy, and making any\nchanges or adjustments to the procedures and\nmethodologies as appropriate. In the event\nthat current market valuations are not readily\navailable or are deemed unreliable, the\nTrust's procedures require the Adviser to\ndetermine a security's fair value. In\ndetermining a fair value, the Adviser may\nconsider, among other things, (i) price\ncomparisons among multiple sources, (ii) a\nreview of corporate actions and news events,\nand (iii) a review of relevant financial\nindicators (e.g., movement in interest rates,\nmarket indices, and prices from the Fund's\nIndex provider). In these cases, the Fund's\nnet asset value may reflect certain portfolio\nsecurities' fair values rather than their\nmarket prices. The fair value of a portfolio\ninstrument is generally the price which the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive upon\nits current sale in an orderly market between\nmarket participants. Ascertaining fair value\nrequires a determination of the amount that an\narm's-length buyer, under the circumstances,\nwould currently pay for the portfolio\ninstrument. Fair value pricing involves\nsubjective judgments and it is possible that\nthe fair value determination for a security is\nmaterially different than the value that could\nbe realized upon the sale of the security. In\naddition, fair value pricing could result in a\ndifference between the prices used to\ncalculate the Fund's net asset value and the\nprices used by the Index. This may result in a\ndifference between the Fund's performance and\nthe performance of the Index. Dividends and\nDistributions The following information\nsupplements and should be read in conjunction\nwith the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c\nDISTRIBUTIONS. \u201d GENERAL POLICIES Dividends\nfrom net investment income, if any, are\ngenerally declared and paid quarterly by the\nFund. Distributions of net realized securities\ngains, if any, generally are declared and paid\nonce a year, but the Trust may make\ndistributions on a more frequent basis for the\nFund to improve index tracking or to comply\nwith the distribution requirements of the\nInternal Revenue Code, in all events in a\nmanner consistent with the provisions of the\n1940 Act. Dividends and other distributions on\nShares are distributed, as described below, on\na pro rata basis to Beneficial Owners of such\nShares. Dividend payments are made through DTC\nParticipants and Indirect Participants to\nBeneficial Owners then of record with proceeds\nreceived from the Trust. Management of the\nTrust reserves the right to declare special\ndividends if, in its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or advisable to\npreserve the Fund's eligibility for treatment\nas a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code or to\navoid imposition of income or excise taxes at\nthe Fund level. DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT Broker\ndealers, at their own discretion, may offer a\ndividend reinvestment service under which\nShares are purchased in the secondary market\nat current market prices. Investors should\nconsult their broker dealer for further\ninformation regarding any dividend\nreinvestment service offered by such broker\ndealer. Taxes The following is a summary of\ncertain federal income tax considerations\ngenerally affecting the Fund and its\nshareholders that supplements the discussions\nin the Prospectus. No attempt is made to\npresent a comprehensive explanation of the\nfederal, state, local or foreign tax treatment\nof the Fund or its shareholders, and the\ndiscussion here and in each Prospectus is not\nintended to be a substitute for careful tax\nplanning. The following general discussion of\ncertain federal income tax consequences is\nbased on the Internal Revenue Code and the\nregulations issued thereunder as in effect on\nthe date of this SAI. New legislation, as well\nas administrative changes or court decisions,\nmay significantly change the conclusions\nexpressed herein, and may have a retroactive\neffect with respect to the transactions\ncontemplated herein.\n\n44\n\nThe following information should be read in\nconjunction with the section in the Prospectus\nentitled \u201c ADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION. \u201d\nTAXATION OF THE FUND The Fund is treated as a\nseparate corporation for federal income tax\npurposes. The Fund therefore is considered to\nbe a separate entity in determining its\ntreatment under the rules for RICs described\nherein and in the Prospectus. Losses in one\nseries of the Trust do not offset gains in any\nother series of the Trust and the requirements\n(other than certain organizational\nrequirements) for qualifying for treatment as\na RIC are determined at the Fund level rather\nthan at the Trust level. The Fund has elected\nor will elect and intends to qualify each year\nto be treated as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. As\nsuch, the Fund should not be subject to\nfederal income tax on its net investment\nincome and capital gains, if any, to the\nextent that it timely distributes such income\nand capital gains to its shareholders. In\norder to qualify for treatment as a RIC, the\nFund must distribute annually to its\nshareholders at least the sum of 90% of its\ntaxable net investment income (generally\nincluding the excess of net short-term capital\ngains over net long-term capital losses) and\n90% of its net tax-exempt interest income, if\nany (the \u201c Distribution Requirement \u201d ) and\nalso must meet several additional\nrequirements. Among these requirements are the\nfollowing: (i) at least 90% of the Fund's\ngross income each taxable year must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to certain securities loans, gains\nfrom the sale or other disposition of stock,\nsecurities or foreign currencies, or other\nincome derived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly traded\npartnerships (the \u201c Qualifying Income\nRequirement \u201d ); and (ii) at the end of each\nquarter of the Fund's taxable year, its assets\nmust be diversified so that (a) at least 50%\nof the market value of its total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited, in respect to any one\nissuer, to an amount not greater in value than\n5% of the value of the Fund's total assets and\nto not more than 10% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of such issuer, and (b) not more\nthan 25% of the value of its total assets is\ninvested in the securities (other than U.S.\ngovernment securities or securities of other\nRICs) of any one issuer, the securities (other\nthan securities of other RICs) of two or more\nissuers that it controls and that are engaged\nin the same, similar, or related trades or\nbusinesses, or the securities of one or more\nqualified publicly traded partnerships (the \u201c\nDiversification Requirement \u201d ). If the Fund\nfails to satisfy the Qualifying Income\nRequirement or the Diversification Requirement\nin any taxable year, the Fund may be eligible\nfor relief provisions if the failures are due\nto reasonable cause and not willful neglect\nand if a penalty tax is paid with respect to\neach failure to satisfy the applicable\nrequirements. Additionally, relief is provided\nfor certain de minimis failures of the\nDiversification Requirement where the Fund\ncorrects the failure within a specified period\nof time. In order to be eligible for the\nrelief provisions with respect to a failure to\nmeet the Diversification Requirement, the Fund\nmay be required to dispose of certain assets.\nIf these relief provisions were not available\nto the Fund and it were to fail to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all of\nits taxable income would be subject to tax at\nthe applicable corporate rate without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand its distributions (including capital gains\ndistributions) generally would be taxable as\nordinary income dividends to its shareholders,\nsubject to the dividends-received deduction\nfor corporate shareholders and the lower tax\nrates on qualified dividend income received by\nnoncorporate shareholders. To requalify for\ntreatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable\nyear, the Fund would be required to satisfy\nthe RIC qualification requirements for that\nyear and to distribute any earnings and\nprofits from any year in which the Fund failed\nto qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. If the\nFund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period\ngreater than two taxable years, it would\ngenerally be required to pay a Fund-level tax\non certain net built-in gains recognized with\nrespect to certain of its assets upon a\ndisposition of such assets within five years\nof qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year.\nThe Board reserves the right not to maintain\nthe qualification of the Fund for treatment as\na RIC if it determines such course of action\nto be beneficial to shareholders. As discussed\nmore fully below, the Fund intends to\ndistribute substantially all of its net\ninvestment income and its capital gains for\neach taxable year. If the Fund meets the\nDistribution Requirement but retains some or\nall of its income or gains, it will be subject\nto federal income tax to the extent any such\nincome or gains are not distributed. The Fund\nmay designate certain amounts retained as\nundistributed net capital gain in a notice to\nits shareholders, who (i) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gain, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount so designated, (ii) will be entitled to\ncredit their proportionate shares of the\nincome tax paid by the Fund on that\nundistributed amount against their federal\nincome tax liabilities and to claim refunds to\nthe extent such credits exceed their\nliabilities and (iii) will be entitled to\nincrease their tax basis, for federal income\ntax purposes, in their Shares by an amount\nequal to the excess of\n\n45\n\nthe amount of undistributed net capital gain\nincluded in their respective income over their\nrespective income tax credits. If the Fund\nfailed to satisfy the Distribution Requirement\nfor any taxable year, it would be taxed as a\nregular corporation, with consequences\ngenerally similar to those described in the\npreceding paragraph. The Fund will be subject\nto a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed\nincome if it does not distribute to its\nshareholders in each calendar year an amount\nat least equal to 98% of its ordinary income\nfor the calendar year plus 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the twelve months\nended October 31 of such year, subject to an\nincrease for any shortfall in the prior year's\ndistribution. The Fund intends to declare and\ndistribute dividends and distributions in the\namounts and at the times necessary to avoid\nthe application of this 4% excise tax. The\nFund may elect to treat part or all of any \u201c\nqualified late year loss \u201d as if it had been\nincurred in the succeeding taxable year in\ndetermining the Fund's taxable income, net\ncapital gain, net short-term capital gain, and\nearnings and profits. The effect of this\nelection is to treat any such \u201c qualified late\nyear loss \u201d as if it had been incurred in the\nsucceeding taxable year in characterizing Fund\ndistributions for any calendar year. A \u201c\nqualified late year loss \u201d generally includes\nnet capital loss, net long-term capital loss,\nor net short-term capital loss incurred after\nOctober 31 of the current taxable year\n(commonly referred to as \u201c post-October losses\n\u201d ) and certain other late-year losses.\nCapital losses in excess of capital gains ( \u201c\nnet capital losses \u201d ) are not permitted to be\ndeducted against a RIC's net investment\nincome. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, potentially subject to certain\nlimitations, the Fund may carry a net capital\nloss from any taxable year forward\nindefinitely to offset its capital gains, if\nany, in years following the year of the loss.\nTo the extent subsequent capital gains are\noffset by such losses, they will not result in\nU.S. federal income tax liability to the Fund\nand may not be distributed as capital gains to\nits shareholders. Generally, the Fund may not\ncarry forward any losses other than net\ncapital losses. TAXATION OF\nSHAREHOLDERS\u2014DISTRIBUTIONS The Fund intends to\ndistribute annually to its shareholders\nsubstantially all of its investment company\ntaxable income (computed without regard to the\ndeduction for dividends paid), its net tax-\nexempt income, if any, and any net capital\ngain (net recognized long-term capital gains\nin excess of net recognized short-term capital\nlosses, taking into account any capital loss\ncarryforwards). The Fund will report to\nshareholders annually the amounts of dividends\npaid from ordinary income, the amount of\ndistributions of net capital gain, the portion\nof dividends which may qualify for the\ndividends-received deduction, and the portion\nof dividends which may qualify for treatment\nas qualified dividend income. Subject to\ncertain limitations, dividends reported by the\nFund as qualified dividend income will be\ntaxable to noncorporate shareholders at\nreduced rates. Dividends may be reported by\nthe Fund as qualified dividend income if they\nare attributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by the Fund. Qualified dividend\nincome includes, in general, subject to\ncertain holding period requirements and other\nrequirements, dividend income from certain\nU.S. and foreign corporations. Subject to\ncertain limitations, eligible foreign\ncorporations include those incorporated in\npossessions of the United States, those\nincorporated in certain countries with\ncomprehensive tax treaties with the United\nStates and other foreign corporations if the\nstock with respect to which the dividends are\npaid is tradable on an established securities\nmarket in the United States. A dividend\ngenerally will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income to the extent that (i) the\nshareholder has not held the stock on which\nthe dividend was paid for more than 60 days\nduring the 121-day period that begins on the\ndate that is 60 days before the date on which\nthe stock becomes ex-dividend with respect to\nsuch dividend or, in the case of certain\npreferred stock, for more than 90 days during\nthe 181-day period beginning 90 days before\nsuch date, (ii) the shareholder is under an\nobligation (whether pursuant to a short sale\nor otherwise) to make related payments with\nrespect to substantially similar or related\nproperty, or (iii) the shareholder elects to\ntreat such dividend as investment income under\nsection 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue\nCode. The holding period requirements\ndescribed in this paragraph apply to the\nshareholders' investments in the Fund and to\nthe Fund's investments in underlying dividend-\npaying stocks. Dividends treated as received\nby the Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be\ntreated as qualified dividend income generally\nonly to the extent the dividend distributions\nare attributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or RIC. It is expected\nthat any dividends received by the Fund from a\nREIT and distributed by the Fund to a\nshareholder generally will be taxable to the\nshareholder as ordinary income. Additionally,\nincome derived in connection with the Fund's\nsecurities lending activities will, in\ngeneral, not be treated as qualified dividend\nincome. If 95% or more of the Fund's gross\nincome (calculated without taking into account\nnet capital gain derived from sales or other\ndispositions of stock or securities) consists\nof qualified dividend income, the Fund may\nreport all distributions of such income as\nqualified dividend income. Certain dividends\nreceived by the Fund from U.S. corporations\n(generally, dividends received by the Fund in\nrespect of any share of stock (1) with a tax\nholding period of at least 46 days during the\n91-day period beginning on the date that is 45\ndays before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend as to that dividend and\n(2) that is held in an unleveraged\n\n46\n\nposition) when distributed and appropriately\nso reported by the Fund may be eligible for\nthe 50% dividends-received deduction generally\navailable to corporations under the Internal\nRevenue Code. Dividends received by the Fund\nfrom REITs will not be eligible for that\ndeduction. In order to qualify for the\ndeduction, corporate shareholders must meet\nthe minimum holding period requirement stated\nabove with respect to their Shares, taking\ninto account any holding period reductions\nfrom certain hedging or other transactions or\npositions that diminish their risk of loss\nwith respect to their Shares, and, if they\nborrow to acquire or otherwise incur debt\nattributable to Shares, they may be denied a\nportion of the dividends-received deduction\nwith respect to those Shares. Any corporate\nshareholder should consult its tax adviser\nregarding the possibility that its tax basis\nin its Shares may be reduced, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, by reason of \u201c\nextraordinary dividends \u201d received with\nrespect to the Shares and, to the extent such\nbasis would be reduced below zero, current\nrecognition of income may be required.\nDistributions from the Fund's net short-term\ncapital gains will generally be taxable to\nshareholders as ordinary income. Distributions\nfrom the Fund's net capital gain will be\ntaxable to shareholders at long-term capital\ngains rates, regardless of how long\nshareholders have held their Shares. Long-term\ncapital gains are generally taxed to\nnoncorporate shareholders at reduced rates.\nCertain capital gain dividends attributable to\ndividends the Fund receives from REITs may be\ntaxable to noncorporate shareholders at a rate\nother than the reduced rates generally\napplicable to long-term capital gains.\nAlthough dividends generally will be treated\nas distributed when paid, any dividend\ndeclared by the Fund in October, November or\nDecember and payable to shareholders of record\nin such a month that is paid during the\nfollowing January will be treated for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes as received by\nshareholders on December 31 of the calendar\nyear in which it was declared. If the Fund's\ndistributions exceed its earnings and profits,\nall or a portion of the distributions made in\nthe taxable year may be treated as a return of\ncapital to shareholders. A return of capital\ndistribution generally will not be taxable but\nwill reduce the shareholder's cost basis and\nresult in a higher capital gain or lower\ncapital loss when the Shares on which the\ndistribution was received are sold. After a\nshareholder's basis in the Shares has been\nreduced to zero, distributions in excess of\nearnings and profits will be treated as gain\nfrom the sale of the shareholder's Shares.\nUnder Section 163(j) of the Code, a taxpayer's\nbusiness interest expense is generally\ndeductible to the extent of its business\ninterest income plus certain other amounts. If\nthe Fund earns business interest income, it\nmay report a portion of its dividends as \u201c\nSection 163(j) interest dividends, \u201d which its\nshareholders may be able to treat as business\ninterest income for purposes of Section 163(j)\nof the Code. The Fund's \u201c Section 163(j)\ninterest dividend \u201d for a tax year will be\nlimited to the excess of its business interest\nincome over the sum of its business interest\nexpense and other deductions properly\nallocable to its business interest income. In\ngeneral, the Fund's shareholders may treat a\ndistribution reported as a Section 163(j)\ninterest dividend as interest income only to\nthe extent the distribution exceeds the sum of\nthe portions of the distribution reported as\nother types of tax-favored income. To be\neligible to treat a Section 163(j) interest\ndividend as interest income, a shareholder may\nneed to meet certain holding period\nrequirements in respect of Fund Shares and\nmust not have hedged its position in Fund\nShares in certain ways. Distributions that are\nreinvested in additional Shares of the Fund\nthrough the means of a dividend reinvestment\nservice, if offered by your broker-dealer,\nwill nevertheless be taxable dividends to the\nsame extent as if such dividends had been\nreceived in cash. A 3.8% Medicare contribution\ntax generally applies to all or a portion of\nthe net investment income of a shareholder who\nis an individual and not a nonresident alien\nfor federal income tax purposes and who has\nadjusted gross income (subject to certain\nadjustments) that exceeds a threshold amount\n($250,000 if married filing jointly or if\nconsidered a \u201c surviving spouse \u201d for federal\nincome tax purposes, $125,000 if married\nfiling separately, and $200,000 in other\ncases). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a\nportion of the undistributed net investment\nincome of certain shareholders that are\nestates and trusts. For these purposes,\ninterest, dividends and certain capital gains\n(generally including capital gain\ndistributions and capital gains realized on\nthe sale of Shares) are generally taken into\naccount in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. Distributions of ordinary\nincome and capital gains may also be subject\nto foreign, state and local taxes depending on\na shareholder's circumstances.\n\n47\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014SALE OF SHARES In\ngeneral, a sale of Shares results in capital\ngain or loss, and for individual shareholders,\nis taxable at a federal rate dependent upon\nthe length of time the Shares were held. A\nsale of Shares held for a period of one year\nor less at the time of such sale will, for tax\npurposes, generally result in short-term\ncapital gains or losses, and a sale of those\nheld for more than one year will generally\nresult in long-term capital gains or losses.\nLong-term capital gains are generally taxed to\nnoncorporate shareholders at reduced rates.\nGain or loss on the sale of Shares is measured\nby the difference between the amount received\nand the adjusted tax basis of the Shares.\nShareholders should keep records of\ninvestments made (including Shares acquired\nthrough reinvestment of dividends and\ndistributions) so they can compute the tax\nbasis of their Shares. A loss realized on a\nsale of Shares may be disallowed if\nsubstantially identical Shares are acquired\n(whether through the reinvestment of dividends\nor otherwise) within a sixty-one (61) day\nperiod beginning thirty (30) days before and\nending thirty (30) days after the date that\nthe Shares are disposed of. In such a case,\nthe basis of the Shares acquired must be\nadjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. Any\nloss upon the sale of Shares held for six (6)\nmonths or less will be treated as long-term\ncapital loss to the extent of any amounts\ntreated as distributions to the shareholder of\nlong-term capital gain (including any amounts\ncredited to the shareholder as undistributed\ncapital gains). COST BASIS REPORTING The cost\nbasis of Shares acquired by purchase will\ngenerally be based on the amount paid for the\nShares and then may be subsequently adjusted\nfor other applicable transactions as required\nby the Internal Revenue Code. The difference\nbetween the selling price and the cost basis\nof Shares generally determines the amount of\nthe capital gain or loss realized on the sale\nor exchange of Shares. Contact the broker\nthrough whom you purchased your Shares to\nobtain information with respect to the\navailable cost basis reporting methods and\nelections for your account. TAXATION OF FUND\nINVESTMENTS Dividends and interest received by\nthe Fund on foreign securities may give rise\nto withholding and other taxes imposed by\nforeign countries. Tax conventions between\ncertain countries and the United States may\nreduce or eliminate such taxes. The Fund does\nnot expect to satisfy the requirements for\npassing through to its shareholders any share\nof any foreign taxes paid by the Fund, with\nthe result that shareholders will not include\nsuch taxes in their gross incomes and will not\nbe entitled to a tax deduction or credit for\nsuch taxes on their own returns. Certain of\nthe Fund's investments may be subject to\ncomplex provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode (including provisions relating to hedging\ntransactions, straddles, integrated\ntransactions, foreign currency contracts,\nforward foreign currency contracts, and\nnotional principal contracts) that, among\nother things, may affect the character of\ngains and losses realized by the Fund (e.g.,\nmay affect whether gains or losses are\nordinary or capital), accelerate recognition\nof income to the Fund and defer losses. These\nrules could therefore affect the character,\namount and timing of distributions to\nshareholders. These provisions also may\nrequire the Fund to mark-to-market certain\ntypes of positions in its portfolio (i.e.,\ntreat them as if they were closed out) which\nmay cause the Fund to recognize income without\nreceiving cash with which to make\ndistributions to its shareholders in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the RIC distribution\nrequirements for avoiding income and excise\ntaxes. The Fund intends to monitor its\ntransactions, intends to make appropriate tax\nelections, and intends to make appropriate\nentries in its books and records in order to\nmitigate the effect of these rules and\npreserve the Fund's qualification for\ntreatment as RICs. The Fund is required for\nfederal income tax purposes to mark-to-market\nand recognize as income for each taxable year\nits net unrealized gains and losses on certain\nfutures contracts as of the end of the year as\nwell as those actually realized during the\nyear. Gain or loss from futures and options\ncontracts on broad-based indexes required to\nbe marked to market will be 60% long-term and\n40% short-term capital gain or loss.\nApplication of this rule may alter the timing\nand character of distributions to\nshareholders. The Fund may be required to\ndefer the recognition of losses on futures\ncontracts, options contracts and swaps to the\nextent of any unrecognized gains on offsetting\npositions held by the Fund. It is anticipated\nthat certain net gain realized from the\nclosing out of futures or options contracts\nwill be considered gain from the sale of\nsecurities and therefore will be qualifying\nincome for purposes of the Qualifying Income\nRequirement.\n\n48\n\nTAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS Certain tax-exempt\nshareholders, including qualified pension\nplans, individual retirement accounts, salary\ndeferral arrangements, 401(k) plans, and other\ntax-exempt entities, generally are exempt from\nfederal income taxation except with respect to\ntheir unrelated business taxable income ( \u201c\nUBTI \u201d ). Under current law, the Fund\ngenerally serves to block UBTI from being\nrealized by its tax-exempt shareholders.\nHowever, notwithstanding the foregoing, tax-\nexempt shareholders could realize UBTI by\nvirtue of their investment in the Fund where,\nfor example, (i) the Fund invests in REITs\nthat hold residual interests in real estate\nmortgage investment conduits ( \u201c REMICs \u201d ) or\n(ii) Shares constitute debt-financed property\nin the hands of the tax-exempt shareholders\nwithin the meaning of section 514(b) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Charitable remainder\ntrusts are subject to special rules and should\nconsult their tax advisors. The IRS has issued\nguidance with respect to these issues and\nprospective shareholders, especially\ncharitable remainder trusts, are strongly\nencouraged to consult with their tax advisors\nregarding these issues. Certain tax-exempt\neducational institutions will be subject to a\n1.4% tax on net investment income. For these\npurposes, certain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Shares (among other categories\nof income), are generally taken into account\nin computing a shareholder's net investment\nincome. FOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS Dividends, other\nthan capital gains dividends, \u201c short-term\ncapital gain dividends \u201d and \u201c interest-\nrelated dividends \u201d (described below), paid by\nthe Fund to shareholders who are nonresident\naliens or foreign entities will be subject to\na 30% United States withholding tax unless a\nreduced rate of withholding or a withholding\nexemption is provided under applicable treaty\nlaw to the extent derived from investment\nincome and short-term capital gain or unless\nsuch income is effectively connected with a\nU.S. trade or business carried on through a\npermanent establishment in the United States.\nNonresident shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors concerning the\napplicability of the United States withholding\ntax and the proper withholding form(s) to be\nsubmitted to the Fund. A non-U.S. shareholder\nwho fails to provide an appropriate IRS Form\nW-8 may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Dividends reported by\nthe Fund as (i) interest-related dividends, to\nthe extent such dividends are derived from the\nFund's \u201c qualified net interest income, \u201d or\n(ii) short-term capital gain dividends, to the\nextent such dividends are derived from the\nFund's \u201c qualified short-term gain, \u201d are\ngenerally exempt from this 30% withholding\ntax. \u201c Qualified net interest income \u201d is the\nFund's net income derived from U.S.-source\ninterest and original issue discount, subject\nto certain exceptions and limitations. \u201c\nQualified short-term gain \u201d generally means\nthe excess of the Fund's net short-term\ncapital gain for the taxable year over its net\nlong-term capital loss, if any. In the case of\nShares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if the Fund\nreports the payment as an interest-related\ndividend or as a short-term capital gain\ndividend. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact\ntheir intermediaries with respect to the\napplication of these rules to their accounts.\nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold\nShares comply with IRS requirements that will\ngenerally require them to report information\nregarding U.S. persons investing in, or\nholding accounts with, such entities, a 30%\nwithholding tax may apply to Fund\ndistributions payable to such entities. A\nnon-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the\nwithholding described in this paragraph under\nan applicable intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the U.S. and a foreign government,\nprovided that the shareholder and the\napplicable foreign government comply with the\nterms of such agreement. BACKUP WITHHOLDING\nThe Fund will be required in certain cases to\nwithhold (as \u201c backup withholding \u201d ) on\namounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has\nprovided the Fund either an incorrect tax\nidentification number or no number at all, (2)\nis subject to backup withholding by the IRS\nfor failure to properly report payments of\ninterest or dividends, (3) has failed to\ncertify to the Fund that such shareholder is\nnot subject to backup withholding, or (4) has\nnot certified that such shareholder is a U.S.\nperson (including a U.S. resident alien). The\nbackup withholding rate is currently 24%.\nBackup withholding will not be applied to\npayments that have been subject to the 30%\nwithholding tax on shareholders who are\nneither citizens nor permanent residents of\nthe U.S. CREATION UNITS An Authorized\nParticipant who exchanges securities for\nCreation Units generally will recognize a gain\nor a loss. The gain or loss will be equal to\nthe difference between the market value of the\nCreation Units at the time and the sum of the\nexchanger's aggregate basis in the securities\nsurrendered plus the amount of cash paid for\nsuch Creation Units. A person who redeems\nCreation Units will generally recognize a gain\nor loss equal to the difference between the\nexchanger's basis\n\n49\n\nin the Creation Units and the sum of the\naggregate market value of any securities\nreceived plus the amount of any cash received\nfor such Creation Units. The IRS, however, may\nassert that a loss realized upon an exchange\nof securities for Creation Units cannot be\ndeducted currently under the rules governing \u201c\nwash sales, \u201d or on the basis that there has\nbeen no significant change in economic\nposition. Any gain or loss realized upon a\ncreation of Creation Units will be treated as\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the securities exchanged\ntherefor as capital assets, and otherwise will\nbe ordinary income or loss. Similarly, any\ngain or loss realized upon a redemption of\nCreation Units will be treated as capital gain\nor loss if the Authorized Participant holds\nthe Shares comprising the Creation Units as\ncapital assets, and otherwise will be ordinary\nincome or loss. Any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon the creation of Creation Units\nwill generally be treated as long-term capital\ngain or loss if the securities exchanged for\nsuch Creation Units have been held for more\nthan one year, and otherwise will be short-\nterm capital gain or loss. Any capital gain or\nloss realized upon the redemption of Creation\nUnits will generally be treated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Shares comprising\nthe Creation Units have been held for more\nthan one year, and otherwise, will generally\nbe short-term capital gain or loss. Any\ncapital loss realized upon a redemption of\nCreation Units held for six (6) months or less\nwill be treated as a long-term capital loss to\nthe extent of any amounts treated as\ndistributions to the applicable Authorized\nParticipant of long-term capital gains with\nrespect to the Creation Units (including any\namounts credited to the Authorized Participant\nas undistributed capital gains). The Fund has\nthe right to reject an order for Creation\nUnits if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Shares\nso ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding\nshares of the Fund and if, pursuant to section\n351 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund\nwould have a basis in any deposit securities\ndifferent from the market value of such\nsecurities on the date of deposit. The Fund\nalso has the right to require information\nnecessary to determine beneficial Share\nownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. If the Fund does issue Creation\nUnits to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund, the purchaser\n(or a group of purchasers) may not recognize\ngain or loss upon the exchange of securities\nfor Creation Units. If the Fund redeems\nCreation Units in cash, it may bear additional\ncosts and recognize more capital gains than it\nwould if it redeems Creation Units in kind.\nPersons purchasing or redeeming Creation Units\nshould consult their own tax advisors with\nrespect to the tax treatment of any creation\nor redemption transaction. CERTAIN POTENTIAL\nTAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Under promulgated\nTreasury regulations, if a shareholder\nrecognizes a loss on disposition of the Fund's\nshares of $2 million or more for an individual\nshareholder or $10 million or more for a\ncorporate shareholder (or certain greater\namounts over a combination of years), the\nshareholder must file with the IRS a\ndisclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct\nshareholders of portfolio securities are in\nmany cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not excepted. A\nshareholder who fails to make the required\ndisclosure to the IRS may be subject to\nadverse tax consequences, including\nsignificant penalties. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer's treatment of the loss is proper.\nShareholders should consult their tax advisers\nto determine the applicability of these\nregulations in light of their individual\ncircumstances. The foregoing discussion is a\nsummary only and is not intended as a\nsubstitute for careful tax planning.\nPurchasers of Shares should consult their own\ntax advisors as to the tax consequences of\ninvesting in such Shares, including under\nstate, local and other tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date hereof. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur. STATE TAX MATTERS The discussion\nof state and local tax treatment is based on\nthe assumptions that the Fund will qualify for\ntreatment under Subchapter M of the Internal\nRevenue Code as RICs and that the Fund will\ndistribute all interest and dividends it\nreceives to its shareholders. The tax\ndiscussion summarizes general state and local\ntax laws which are currently in effect and\nwhich are subject to change by legislative,\njudicial or administrative action; any such\nchanges may be retroactive with respect to the\nFund's transactions. Investors should consult\na tax advisor for more detailed information\nabout state and local taxes to which they may\nbe subject.\n\n50\n\nMany states grant tax-free status to dividends\npaid to you from interest earned on direct\nobligations of the U.S. government, subject in\nsome states to minimum investment requirements\nthat must be met by the Fund. Investment in\nGovernment National Mortgage Association ( \u201c\nGinnie Mae \u201d ) or Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d ) securities,\nbanker's acceptances, commercial paper, and\nrepurchase agreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities do not generally qualify\nfor such tax-free treatment. The rules on\nexclusion of this income are different for\ncorporate shareholders. Capital Stock and\nOther Securities The Fund issues Shares of\nbeneficial interest, par value $.01 per Share.\nThe Board may designate additional funds. Each\nShare issued by the Trust has a pro rata\ninterest in the assets of the corresponding\nseries of the Trust. Shares have no\npreemptive, exchange, subscription or\nconversion rights and are freely transferable.\nEach Share is entitled to participate equally\nin dividends and distributions declared by the\nBoard with respect to the Fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of the Fund on\nliquidation. Each Share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which a shareholder\nvote is required consistent with the\nrequirements of the 1940 Act and the rules\npromulgated thereunder. Shares of all series\nof the Trust ( \u201c Funds \u201d ) vote together as a\nsingle class except that if the matter being\nvoted on affects only a particular fund it\nwill be voted on only by that fund and if a\nmatter affects a particular fund differently\nfrom other Funds, that fund will vote\nseparately on such matter. Under Massachusetts\nlaw, the Trust is not required to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the\nTrust is not to hold an annual meeting of\nshareholders unless required to do so under\nthe 1940 Act. All Shares of the Trust\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights for the election of Trustees.\nUnder Massachusetts law, Trustees of the Trust\nmay be removed by vote of the shareholders.\nUnder Massachusetts law, shareholders of a\nbusiness trust may, under certain\ncircumstances, be held personally liable as\npartners for obligations of the Trust.\nHowever, the Declaration of Trust contains an\nexpress disclaimer of shareholder liability\nfor acts or obligations of the Trust, requires\nthat Trust obligations include such\ndisclaimer, and provides for indemnification\nand reimbursement of expenses out of the\nTrust's property for any shareholder held\npersonally liable for the obligations of the\nTrust. Thus, the risk of a shareholder\nincurring financial loss on account of\nshareholder liability is limited to\ncircumstances in which the Trust itself would\nbe unable to meet its obligations. Given the\nabove limitations on shareholder personal\nliability, and the nature of the Fund's assets\nand operations, the risk to shareholders of\npersonal liability is believed to be remote.\nShareholder inquiries may be made by writing\nto the Trust, c/o the Distributor, State\nStreet Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC\nat One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts\n02210. Counsel and Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius\nLLP, located at 1111 Pennsylvania Avenue NW,\nWashington, DC 20004, serves as counsel to the\nTrust. [ ], located at [ ], serves as the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nof the Trust.

Local\nMarket Holiday Schedules The Trust generally\nintends to effect deliveries of portfolio\nsecurities on a basis of \u201c T \u201d plus two\nBusiness Days (i.e., days on which the NYSE is\nopen) in the relevant foreign market of the\nFund. The ability of the Trust to effect in-\nkind redemptions within two Business Days of\nreceipt of a redemption request is subject,\namong other things, to the condition that,\nwithin the time period from the date of the\nrequest to the date of delivery of the\nsecurities, there are no days that are local\nmarket holidays on the relevant Business Days.\nFor every occurrence of one or more\nintervening holidays in the local market that\nare not holidays observed in the United\nStates, the redemption settlement cycle may be\nextended by the number of such intervening\nlocal holidays. In addition to holidays, other\nunforeseeable closings in a foreign market due\nto emergencies may also prevent the Trust from\ndelivering securities within two Business\nDays. The securities delivery cycles currently\npracticable for transferring portfolio\nsecurities to redeeming investors, coupled\nwith local market holiday schedules, may\nrequire a delivery process longer than the\nstandard settlement period. In certain\ncircumstances during the calendar year, the\nsettlement period may be greater than seven\ncalendar days.\n\n51\n\nFinancial Statements The Fund had not\ncommenced operations as of the date of this\nSAI and therefore does not have financial\ninformation to report for the Trust's June 30,\n2023 fiscal year end.\n\n52\n\nAPPENDIX A Standard & Poor's, a division of\nS&P Global ( \u201c S&P \u201d ), Long-Term Issue\nRatings:\n                                              \n                       An obligation rated    \n                       \u2018AAA' has the highest  \n                       rating assigned by     \n                       S&P Global Ratings.    \n  AAA                  The obligor'scapacity  \n                       to meet its financial  \n                       commitments on the     \n                       obligation is          \n                       extremely strong.      \n                       An obligation rated    \n                       \u2018AA' differs from the  \n                       highest-rated          \n                       obligations only to a  \n  AA                   small degree.          \n                       Theobligor's capacity  \n                       to meet its financial  \n                       commitments on the     \n                       obligation is very     \n                       strong.                \n                       An obligation rated    \n                       \u2018A' is somewhat more   \n                       susceptible to the     \n                       adverse effects of     \n                       changes                \n                       incircumstances and    \n                       economic conditions    \n  A                    than obligations in    \n                       higher-rated           \n                       categories.            \n                       However,the obligor's  \n                       capacity to meet its   \n                       financial commitments  \n                       on the obligation is   \n                       still strong.          \n                       An obligation rated    \n                       \u2018BBB' exhibits         \n                       adequate protection    \n                       parameters.

Hybrid securities may also be subject\nto contractually allowable write-downs of\nprincipal that could result in impairment.\nTogether with the hybrid indicator, the long-\nterm obligation rating assigned to a hybrid\nsecurity is an expression of the relative\ncredit risk associated with that security.\nFitch Ratings Ltd.'s ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ) Corporate\nFinance Obligations \u2013 Long-Term Ratings: AAA:\nHighest Credit Quality. \u2018AAA' ratings denote\nthe lowest expectation of credit risk.

We     \n            are also a member of various      \n            investor associations that seek   \n            to address broader corporate      \n            governance-related policy at the  \n            country level.                    \n            The State Street Global Advisors  \n            Asset Stewardship Team may        \n            consult with members of various   \n            investment teams to engage with   \n            companies on corporate            \n            governance issues and to address  \n            any specific concerns. This       \n            facilitates our comprehensive     \n            approach to information           \n            gathering as it relates to items  \n            that are to be voted upon at      \n            upcoming shareholder meetings.    \n            We also conduct issuer-specific   \n            engagements with companies,       \n            covering various corporate        \n            governance and                    \n            sustainability-related topics     \n            outside of proxy season.          \n            The Asset Stewardship Team        \n            employs a blend of quantitative   \n            and qualitative research,         \n            analysis and data in order to     \n            support screens that identify     \n            issuers where active engagement   \n            may be necessary to protect and   \n            promote shareholder value.        \n            Issuer engagement may also be     \n            event-driven, focusing on         \n            issuer-specific corporate         \n            governance or sustainability      \n            concerns, or broader              \n            industry-related trends. We also  \n            consider the size of our          \n            total position in the issuer in   \n            question and/or the potential     \n            negative governance, performance  \n            profile, and circumstance at      \n            hand. As a result, we believe     \n            issuer engagement can take many   \n            forms and be triggered by         \n            numerous circumstances. The       \n            following                         \n            approaches represent how we       \n            define engagement methods:        \n            We use screening tools designed   \n            to capture a mix of               \n            company-specific data, including  \n  Active    governance and sustainability     \n            profiles, to inform our voting    \n            and engagement                    \n            activity.                         \n                                              \nC-3\n                                              \n                 We will actively seek        \n                 direct dialogue with the     \n                 board and management of      \n                 companies that we have       \n                 identified through our       \n                 screening processes. Such    \n                 engagements may lead to      \n                 further                      \n                 monitoring to ensure that    \n                 the company improves its     \n                 governance or                \n                 sustainability practices.    \n                 In these cases, the          \n                 engagement process           \n                 represents the most          \n                 meaningful opportunity for   \n                 us to protect long-term      \n                 shareholder value from       \n                 excessive risk due to        \n                 poor governance and          \n                 sustainability practices.    \n                 Reactive engagement is       \n                 initiated by issuers. We     \n                 routinely discuss specific   \n                 voting issues and items      \n  Reactive       with the issuer community.   \n                 Reactive engagement is an    \n                 opportunity to address not   \n                 only voting items, but also  \n                 a wide range of governance   \n                 and sustainability issues.   \n                 We have established an       \n                 engagement protocol that     \n                 further describes our        \n                 approach to issuer           \n                 engagement.                  \n                 Our stewardship activities   \n                 are designed to have an      \n                 impact on company-specific   \n  Measurement    and market-level disclosure  \n                 and oversight practices      \n                 that we believe protect and  \n                 promote shareholder value.   \n                 Company-specific successes   \n                 Assessing the effectiveness  \n                 of our company-specific      \n                 engagement process can be    \n                 challenging to measure. To   \n                 limit subjectivity in        \n                 measuring our success, we    \n                 actively seek issuer         \n                 feedback and monitor the     \n                 actions taken by issuers     \n                 post-engagement in order to  \n                 identify tangible changes.   \n                 This enables us to           \n                 establish indicators to      \n                 gauge how issuers respond    \n                 to our concerns and to what  \n                 degree these responses       \n                 satisfy our requests. It     \n                 is also important to note    \n                 that successful engagement   \n                 activity can be measured     \n                 over multiple years          \n                 depending on the facts and   \n                 circumstances involved.      \n                 These engagements not only   \n                 inform our voting decisions  \n                 but also allow us to         \n                 monitor improvement over     \n                 time and to contribute to    \n                 our evolving perspectives    \n                 on priority areas. We also   \n                 track the impact of our      \n                 proxy votes by reviewing     \n                 changing trends in market    \n                 practices on specific        \n                 corporate-governance or      \n                 sustainability-related       \n                 issues that we address       \n                 through voting action.

In such                          \n  cases, the composition of the key           \n  oversight committees of a board should      \n  meet the minimum standards of               \n  independence. Accordingly, we may vote      \n  against a nominee at a company with         \n  appropriate governance practices if the     \n  director is classified as                   \n  non-independent under relevant listing      \n  standards or local market practice and      \n  serves on a key committee of the board      \n  (compensation, audit, nominating, or        \n  committees required to be fully             \n  independent by local market standards).     \n  Conversely, if a company demonstrates       \n  negative governance practices, State        \n  Street Global Advisors believes the         \n  classification standards for director       \n  independence should be elevated. In such    \n  circumstances, we                           \n  will evaluate all director nominees based   \n  upon the following classification           \n  standards:                                  \n  \u0095\u2002\u200aIs the nominee an employee of or related  \n  to an employee of the                       \n  issuer or its auditor?                      \n  \u0095\u2002\u200aDoes the nominee provide professional     \n  services to the                             \n  issuer?                                     \n  \u0095\u2002\u200aHas the nominee attended an appropriate   \n  number of board                             \n  meetings?                                   \n  \u0095\u2002\u200aHas the nominee received non-board        \n  related compensation from                   \n  the issuer?                                 \n  In the US market where companies            \n  demonstrate negative governance practices,  \n  these stricter standards will apply not     \n  only to directors who are a member of a     \n  key committee but to all directors on the   \n  board as                                    \n  market practice permits. Accordingly, we    \n  may vote against a nominee (with the        \n  exception of the CEO) where the board has   \n  inappropriate governance practices and is   \n  considered not independent based on the     \n  above independence criteria.                \n  Additionally, we may withhold votes from    \n  directors                                   \n  based on the following:                     \n                                              \n  \u0095\u2002\u200aOverall average board tenure is           \n  excessive.

If a company does not      \n  meet                                        \n  the applicable expectation, State Street    \n  Global Advisors may vote against the Chair  \n  of the board\u0092s nominating committee or the   \n  board leader in the absence of a            \n  nominating committee.

If a company in the Russell      \n  1000 does not disclose, at minimum, the     \n  gender, racial and ethnic composition of    \n  its board, we may vote against the Chair    \n  of the nominating committee. We may         \n  withhold support from the Chair of the      \n  nominating committee also when a company    \n  in the                                      \n  S&P 500 does not have at least one          \n  director from an underrepresented           \n  racial/ethnic community on its board.       \n  Workforce Diversity                         \n  We may vote against the Chair of the        \n  compensation                                \n  committee at companies in the S&P 500 that  \n  do not                                      \n  disclose their EEO-1 reports.

Such meetings help us assess    \n  the quality and effectiveness of the        \n  board, the extent of the oversight of       \n  management, and the board\u0092s perspectives on  \n  key issues,                                 \n  such as strategy, risk, capital             \n  allocation, and compensation. It also       \n  allows us to escalate matters to the        \n  board\u0092s attention if management has been     \n  unresponsive to suggestions discussed       \n  during prior engagements.                   \n  \u0095\u2002\u200aAfter our initial meeting with members    \n  of the board, the frequency                 \n  of desired follow-up meetings is            \n  determined by the nature of the issues      \n  discussed.
