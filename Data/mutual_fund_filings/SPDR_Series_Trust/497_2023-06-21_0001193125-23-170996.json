The impact of\nchanges in regulations and capital\nrequirements on a banking company cannot be\npredicted and may negatively impact such\nbanking company. Profitability is largely\ndependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds, and can fluctuate significantly\nwhen interest rates change. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of\nborrowers can negatively impact banking\ncompanies. Banks may also be subject to severe\nprice competition. Competition is high among\nbanking companies and failure to maintain or\nincrease market share may result in lost\nmarket value. Regional Bank Risk:Investments\nin regional banks, which may be small or\nmedium in size, may involve greater risk than\ninvesting in larger, more established banks.\nSecurities of regional banks are often less\nliquid and subject to greater volatility and\nless trading volume than is customarily\nassociated with securities of larger banks. A\nregional bank\u2019s financial performance may be\ndependent upon the business environment in\ncertain geographic regions of the United\nStates and, as a result, adverse economic or\nemployment developments in such regions may\nnegatively impact such regional bank and, in\nturn, the Fund.\n                                              \n      Effective immediately, the following    \n      replaces the \u201cBanking Companies Risk\u201d   \n  2.  in the \u201cADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION\u201d    \n      section beginning on page 267 of the    \n      Prospectus:                             \n                                              \nBanking Companies Risk.The performance of bank\nstocks may be affected by extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which may limit the\namounts and types of loans and other financial\ncommitments they can make, the interest rates\nand fees they can charge, and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. The impact of\nchanges in regulations and capital\nrequirements on a banking company cannot be\npredicted and may negatively impact such\nbanking company. Profitability is largely\ndependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds, and can fluctuate significantly\nwhen interest rates change. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of\nborrowers can negatively impact banking\ncompanies. To the extent a bank\u2019s portfolio of\nloans or investments are concentrated in a\nparticular industry, the bank may be\nvulnerable to economic conditions that affect\nthat industry. Banks may also be subject to\nsevere price competition. Competition among\nbanking companies is high and failure to\nmaintain or increase market share may result\nin lost market value. Regional Bank Risk:\nInvestments in regional banks, which may be\nsmall or medium in size, may involve greater\nrisk than investing in larger, more\nestablished banks. Securities of regional\nbanks are often less liquid and subject to\ngreater volatility and less trading volume\nthan is customarily associated with securities\nof larger banks. A regional bank\u2019s financial\nperformance may be dependent upon the business\nenvironment in certain geographic regions of\nthe United States and, as a result, adverse\neconomic or employment developments in such\nregions may negatively impact such regional\nbank and, in turn, a Fund. In March 2023, the\nshut\u2011down of certain regional banks resulted\nin concerns over disruption in the U.S.\nbanking system. Additional bank shut-downs or\nfailures in the future could have adverse\nimpacts on a Fund. PLEASE RETAIN THIS\nSUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE 062123SUPP1\n"
