  "text": "SPDR \u00aeSeries Trust\n\nSupplement dated July 7, 2021 to the currently\neffective Statements of Additional Information\n(\u0093SAIs\u0094),\n\neach as may be supplemented from time to time\n\nEffective immediately, the section of the SAIs\nentitled \u0093DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE\u0094\n\nis deleted in its entirety and replaced with\nthe following:\n\nDETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE\n\nThe following\ninformation supplements and should be read in\nconjunction with the sections in the\nProspectus entitled \u0093PURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION\u0094 and \u0093ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION.\u0094\n\nNAV per Share for each Fund is computed by\ndividing the value of the net assets of the\nFund (i.e., the value of its total assets less\ntotal liabilities) by\nthe total number of Shares outstanding.\nExpenses and fees, including the management\nfees, are accrued daily and taken into account\nfor purposes of determining NAV. The NAV of\neach Fund is calculated by State Street and\ndetermined once daily as of\nthe close of the regular trading session on\nthe NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern time)\non each day that such exchange is open.\nCreation/redemption order cut-off times may be\nearlier on any day that the\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation (or applicable exchange or market\non which a Fund\u0092s investments are traded)\nannounces an early closing time. Any assets or\nliabilities denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar\nare converted into U.S. dollars at market\nrates on the date of valuation (generally as\nof 4:00 p.m. London time) as quoted by one or\nmore sources.\n\nIn\ncalculating a Fund\u0092s NAV per Share, the Fund\u0092s\ninvestments are generally valued using market\nvaluations. A market valuation generally means\na valuation (i) obtained from an exchange, a\npricing service, or a major market maker (or\ndealer), (ii) based on a price quotation or\nother equivalent indication of value supplied\nby an exchange, a pricing service, or a major\nmarket maker (or dealer) or (iii) based on\namortized cost. A Fund relies on a third-party\nservice provider\nfor assistance with the daily calculation of\nthe Fund\u0092s NAV. The third-party service\nprovider, in turn, relies on other parties for\ncertain pricing data and other inputs used in\nthe calculation of the Fund\u0092s NAV. Therefore,\na Fund is\nsubject to certain operational risks\nassociated with reliance on its service\nprovider and that service provider\u0092s sources\nof pricing and other data. NAV calculation may\nbe adversely affected by operational risks\narising from factors such as\nerrors or failures in systems and technology.\nSuch errors or failures may result in an\ninaccurately calculated NAV, delays in the\ncalculation of a NAV and/or the inability to\ncalculate a NAV over extended time periods. A\nFund may be unable to\nrecover any losses associated with such\nfailures. In the case of shares of other funds\nthat are not traded on an exchange, a market\nvaluation means such fund\u0092s published NAV per\nshare. A price obtained from a pricing service\nbased on such\npricing service\u0092s valuation matrix may be\nconsidered a market valuation. The Adviser may\nuse various pricing services, or discontinue\nthe use of any pricing service, as approved by\nthe Board from time to time. Fixed-income\nassets are generally\nvalued as of the announced closing time for\ntrading in fixed-income instruments in a\nparticular market or exchange, and generally\n4:00 p.m. EST for U.S. fixed-income assets.\nFixed-income assets are generally valued at\nthe mean of the bid and ask\nprices for bank loans and inflation protected\nsecurities, and at the bid price for all other\nfixed-income assets.\n\nIn the event that current market\nvaluations are not readily available or are\ndeemed unreliable, the Trust\u0092s procedures\nrequire the Oversight Committee to determine a\nsecurity\u0092s fair value if a market price is not\nreadily available. In determining such value\nthe Oversight\nCommittee may consider, among other things,\n(i) price comparisons among multiple sources,\n(ii) a review of corporate actions and news\nevents, and (iii) a review of relevant\nfinancial indicators (e.g., movement in\ninterest\nrates, market indices, and prices from each\nFund\u0092s Index Provider). In these cases, the\nFund\u0092s NAV may reflect certain portfolio\nsecurities\u0092 fair values rather than their\nmarket prices. The fair value of a portfolio\ninstrument is\ngenerally the price which a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive upon its current\nsale in an orderly market between market\nparticipants. Ascertaining fair value requires\na determination of the amount that an\narm\u0092s-length buyer, under the circumstances,\nwould currently pay for the portfolio\ninstrument. Fair value pricing involves\nsubjective judgments and it is possible that\nthe fair value determination for a\nsecurity is materially different than the\nvalue that could be realized upon the sale of\nthe security. In addition, fair value pricing\ncould result in a difference between the\nprices used to calculate a Fund\u0092s NAV and the\nprices used by the\nFund\u0092s benchmark Index. This may result in a\ndifference between the Fund\u0092s performance and\nthe performance of the applicable Fund\u0092s\nbenchmark Index. With respect to securities\nthat are primarily listed on foreign\nexchanges, the value\nof a Fund\u0092s portfolio securities may change on\ndays when you will not be able to purchase or\nsell your Shares.\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE\nREFERENCE\n\n070721SUPP2\n\nSPDR \u00aeSeries Trust\n\nSupplement dated July 7, 2021 to the Statement\nof Additional Information (\u0093SAI\u0094),\n\ndated October 31, 2020, each as may be\nsupplemented from time to time\n\nEffective immediately, the section of the SAI\nentitled \u0093DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE\u0094\n\nis deleted in its entirety and replaced with\nthe following:\n\nDETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE\n\nThe following\ninformation supplements and should be read in\nconjunction with the sections in the\napplicable Prospectus entitled \u0093PURCHASE AND\nSALE INFORMATION\u0094 and \u0093ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND\nSALE INFORMATION.\u0094\n\nNAV per Share for each Fund is computed by\ndividing the value of the net assets of the\nFund (i.e., the value of its total assets less\ntotal liabilities) by\nthe total number of Shares outstanding.\nExpenses and fees, including the management\nfees, are accrued daily and taken into account\nfor purposes of determining NAV. The NAV of\neach Fund other than the SPDR Bloomberg\nBarclays 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF is calculated by\nState Street and determined once daily as of\nthe close of the regular trading session on\nthe NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern time)\non\neach day that such exchange is open. With\nrespect to the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 1-3\nMonth T-Bill ETF, the Fund\u0092s NAV is calculated\nand determined twice daily on each day the\nNYSE is open at the following times: (i) 12:00\np.m. Eastern time; and\n(ii) at the close of the regular trading\nsession on the NYSE. Creation/redemption order\ncut-off times may be earlier on any day that\nthe Securities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation (or applicable\nexchange or market on which a Fund\u0092s\ninvestments are traded) announces an early\nclosing time. Any assets or liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar are converted into U.S. dollars at\nmarket rates on the date of\nvaluation (generally as of 4:00 p.m. London\ntime) as quoted by one or more sources.\n\nIn calculating a Fund\u0092s NAV per Share, the\nFund\u0092s\ninvestments are generally valued using market\nvaluations.

A\nFund relies on a third-party service provider\nfor assistance with the daily calculation of\nthe Fund\u0092s\nNAV. The third-party service provider, in\nturn, relies on other parties for certain\npricing data and other inputs used in the\ncalculation of the Fund\u0092s NAV. Therefore, a\nFund is subject to certain operational risks\nassociated with reliance on\nits service provider and that service\nprovider\u0092s sources of pricing and other data.\nNAV calculation may be adversely affected by\noperational risks arising from factors such as\nerrors or failures in systems and technology.\nSuch errors or\nfailures may result in an inaccurately\ncalculated NAV, delays in the calculation of a\nNAV and/or the inability to calculate a NAV\nover extended time periods. A Fund may be\nunable to recover any losses associated with\nsuch failures. In the case of\nshares of other funds that are not traded on\nan exchange, a market valuation means such\nfund\u0092s published NAV per share. A price\nobtained from a pricing service based on such\npricing service\u0092s valuation matrix may be\nconsidered a market\nvaluation. The Adviser may use various pricing\nservices, or discontinue the use of any\npricing service, as approved by the Board from\ntime to time. Fixed-income assets are\ngenerally valued as of the announced closing\ntime for trading in fixed-income\ninstruments in a particular market or\nexchange, and generally 4:00 p.m. EST for U.S.\nfixed-income assets (except U.S. fixed-income\nassets are generally valued as of 12:00 p.m.\nEST for the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays\n1-3 Month T-Bill ETF\u0092s 12:00 p.m. Eastern time\nNAV calculation). Fixed-income assets are\ngenerally valued at the mean of the bid and\nask prices for bank loans and\ninflation protected securities, and at the bid\nprice for all other fixed-income assets.\n\nIn the event that current market valuations\nare not readily\navailable or are deemed unreliable, the\nTrust\u0092s procedures require the Oversight\nCommittee to determine a security\u0092s fair value\nif a market price is not readily available.
