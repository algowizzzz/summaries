  "text": "SPDR SERIES TRUST\n\n(the \u0093Trust\u0094)\n\nSupplement dated May 24, 2024 to the currently effective Statement of Additional Information (\u0093SAI\u0094),\n\nas may be supplemented from time to time\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently adopted rule amendments to shorten the standard\nsettlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions from T+2 (i.e., two business days after the trade date)\nto T+1 (i.e., one business day after the trade date), subject to certain exceptions. Consistent with the\nrule amendments, effective May 28, 2024 (the \u0093Effective Date\u0094), each series of the Trust appearing in this\nSAI will generally issue creation units and deliver redemption proceeds on a T+1 basis. Accordingly, the\nfollowing changes are made to the SAI as of the Effective Date:\n                                                                                                            \n  1)  The following replaces the discussion under the heading entitled \u0093PROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION  \n      UNITS\u0094 within the section entitled \u0093PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS\u0094:                          \n                                                                                                            \nTo be eligible to place orders with\nthe Principal Underwriter, as facilitated via the Transfer Agent, to purchase a Creation Unit of a Fund, an\nentity must be (i) a \u0093Participating Party\u0094, i.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing\nprocess through the\nContinuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the \u0093Clearing Process\u0094), a clearing agency that is registered\nwith the SEC; or (ii) a DTC Participant (see \u0093BOOK ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM\u0094). In addition, each Participating\nParty or DTC\nParticipant (each, an \u0093Authorized Participant\u0094) must execute a Participant Agreement that has been agreed to\nby the Principal Underwriter and the Transfer Agent, and that has been accepted by the Trust, with respect\nto purchases and\nredemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of a\nParticipant Agreement, on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain\nconditions, including that it will pay to the Trust,\nan amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component together with the creation transaction fee (described\nbelow) and any other applicable fees, taxes and additional variable charge.\n\nAll orders to purchase Shares directly from a Fund, including non-standard orders, must be placed for one or\nmore\nCreation Units and in the manner and by the time set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or the\napplicable order form. The date on which an order to purchase Creation Units (or an order to redeem Creation\nUnits, as set forth below) is received\nand accepted is referred to as the \u0093Order Placement Date.\u0094\n\nAn Authorized Participant may require an investor to make certain representations or\nenter into agreements with respect to the order (e.g., to provide for payments of cash, when required).\nInvestors should be aware that their particular broker may not have executed a Participant Agreement and\nthat, therefore, orders to purchase\nShares directly from a Fund in Creation Units have to be placed by the investor\u0092s broker through an\nAuthorized Participant that has executed a Participant Agreement. In such cases there may be additional\ncharges to such investor. At any given\ntime, there may be only a limited number of broker-dealers that have executed a Participant Agreement and\nonly a small number of such Authorized Participants may have international capabilities.\n\nOn days when the Exchange or the bond markets close earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to create\nCreation Units to be placed earlier in the day.\nIn addition, if a market or markets on which a Fund\u0092s investments are primarily traded is closed, the Fund\nwill also generally not accept orders on such day(s). Orders must be transmitted by an Authorized\nParticipant by telephone or other\ntransmission method acceptable to the Distributor pursuant to procedures set forth in the Participant\nAgreement and in accordance with the applicable order form. Those placing orders through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order by the cut-off time. Economic or market disruptions or\nchanges, or telephone or other communication failure may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or an\nAuthorized Participant.\n\nFund Deposits must be delivered by an Authorized Participant through the Federal Reserve System (for cash\nand U.S. government\nsecurities), or through DTC (for corporate securities and municipal securities), through a subcustody agent\n(for foreign securities) and/or through such other arrangements allowed by the Trust or its agents. With\nrespect to foreign Deposit\nSecurities, the Custodian shall cause the subcustodian of a Fund to maintain an account into which the\nAuthorized Participant shall deliver, on behalf of itself or the party on whose behalf it is acting, such\nDeposit Securities. Foreign Deposit\nSecurities must be delivered to an account maintained at the applicable local subcustodian.\n\n1\n\nThe Fund Deposit transfer must be ordered by the Authorized Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure\nthe delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, to the account of a Fund or its agents by no later than the Settlement Date. The \u0093Settlement\nDate\u0094 with respect to a creation order for a Fund is generally the first Business Day (\u0093T+1\u0094) after the\nOrder Placement\nDate. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as applicable,\nand the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered\nsecurities or cash, as applicable, will be\ndetermined by the Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash represented by\nthe Cash Component must be transferred directly to the Custodian through the Federal Reserve Bank wire\ntransfer system in a timely manner so\nas to be received by the Custodian no later than the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, are not received in a timely manner by the Settlement Date, the\ncreation order may be cancelled.\nUpon written notice to the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day\nusing a Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery of\nCreation Units so created generally will\noccur no later than the first Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received\nby the Distributor.\n\nThe order\nshall be deemed to be received on the Business Day on which the order is placed provided that the order is\nplaced in proper form prior to the applicable cut-off time and the federal funds in the appropriate\namount are deposited by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions), with the\nCustodian on the Settlement Date. If the order is not placed in proper form as required, or federal funds in\nthe appropriate amount are not received\nby 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions) on the Settlement Date, then the order\nmay be deemed to be rejected and the Authorized Participant shall be liable to the Fund for losses, if any,\nresulting therefrom. A creation\nrequest is considered to be in \u0093proper form\u0094 if all procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement, order\nform and this SAI are properly followed.\n\nShortened settlement cycles are expected to be available, through which creation transactions can be settled\non the trade date in accordance\nwith instructions provided by the Trust and/or Distributor.\n                                                                                                            \n      The following replaces the discussion under the heading entitled \u0093PROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF         \n  2)  CREATION                                                                                              \n      UNITS\u0094 within the section entitled \u0093PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS\u0094:                          \n                                                                                                            \nAfter the Trust has\ndeemed an order for redemption received, the Trust will initiate procedures to transfer the requisite\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to the Authorized Participant by the Settlement Date.\nThe \u0093Settlement Date\u0094 with\nrespect to a redemption order for a Fund is generally T+1. With respect to in-kind redemptions of a Fund,\nthe calculation of the value of the Redemption Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to be\ndelivered upon redemption will be made by the Custodian according to the procedures set forth under\n\u0093Determination of Net Asset Value\u0094, computed on the Business Day on which a redemption order is deemed\nreceived by the Trust. Therefore, if\na redemption order in proper form is submitted to the Principal Underwriter by a DTC Participant by the\nspecified time on the Order Placement Date, and the requisite number of Shares of a Fund are delivered to\nthe Custodian prior to 2:00 p.m. or\n3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions) on the Settlement Date, then the value of the\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to be delivered will be determined by the Custodian on\nsuch Order Placement Date. If the\nrequisite number of Shares of the Fund are not delivered by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per\napplicable instructions) on the Settlement Date, the Fund will not release the underlying securities for\ndelivery unless collateral is posted in\nsuch percentage amount of missing Shares as set forth in the Participant Agreement (marked to market daily).\n\nWith respect to in-kind redemptions of a Fund, in connection with taking delivery of shares of Redemption\nSecurities upon redemption of Creation Units, an Authorized Participant must maintain appropriate custody\narrangements with a\nqualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the Redemption\nSecurities are customarily traded (or such other arrangements as allowed by the Trust or its agents), to\nwhich account such Redemption\nSecurities will be delivered. Delivery of redemption proceeds is generally T+1. The order form specifies the\ndate at which the delivery of redemption proceeds for a specific Fund is generally expected to occur.\n\n2\n\nDue to the schedule of holidays in certain countries, however, the delivery of in-kind redemption proceeds\nmay take longer than one Business Day, after the day on which the redemption request is received in proper\nform. If the Authorized Participant has not made appropriate arrangements to\ntake delivery of the Redemption Securities in the applicable foreign jurisdiction and it is not possible to\nmake other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of the Redemption Securities in\nsuch jurisdiction, the Trust may,\nin its discretion, exercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash, and the Authorized Participant will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in cash.\n\nIf it is not possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of the\nRedemption Securities, the Trust\nmay in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash, and the redeeming investor will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In addition, an investor may request a redemption in\ncash that a Fund may, in its sole\ndiscretion, permit. In either case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the NAV of its Shares\nbased on the NAV of Shares of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in\nproper form (minus a redemption\ntransaction fee and additional charge for requested cash redemptions specified above, to offset the Trust\u0092s\nbrokerage and other transaction costs associated with the disposition of Redemption Securities). A Fund may\nalso, in its sole\ndiscretion, upon request of a shareholder, provide such redeemer a portfolio of securities that differs from\nthe exact composition of the Redemption Securities but does not differ in net asset value.\n\nAn Authorized Participant submitting a redemption request is deemed to represent to the Trust that, as of\nthe close of the Business Day on\nwhich the redemption request was submitted, it (or its client) will own (within the meaning of Rule 200 of\nRegulation SHO) or has arranged to borrow for delivery to the Trust on or prior to the Settlement Date of\nthe redemption request, the\nrequisite number of Shares of the relevant Fund to be redeemed as a Creation Unit. In either case, the\nAuthorized Participant is deemed to acknowledge that: (i) it (or its client) has full legal authority and\nlegal right to tender for\nredemption the requisite number of Shares of the applicable Fund and to receive the entire proceeds of the\nredemption; and (ii) if such Shares submitted for redemption have been loaned or pledged to another party or\nare the subject of a\nrepurchase agreement, securities lending agreement or any other arrangement affecting legal or beneficial\nownership of such Shares being tendered, there are no restrictions precluding the tender and delivery of\nsuch Shares (including borrowed\nshares, if any) for redemption, free and clear of liens, on the redemption Settlement Date. The Trust\nreserves the right to verify these representations at its discretion, but will typically require\nverification with respect to a redemption request\nfrom a Fund in connection with higher levels of redemption activity and/or short interest in the Fund. If\nthe Authorized Participant, upon receipt of a verification request, does not provide sufficient verification\nof its representations as\ndetermined by the Trust, the redemption request will not be considered to have been received in proper form\nand may be rejected by the Trust.\n\nRedemptions of Shares for Redemption Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable federal and\nstate securities laws and each Fund\n(whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash\nto the extent that the Trust could not lawfully deliver specific Redemption Securities upon redemptions or\ncould not do so without first\nregistering the Redemption Securities under such laws. An Authorized Participant or an investor for which it\nis acting subject to a legal restriction with respect to a particular security included in the Redemption\nSecurities applicable to the\nredemption of Creation Units may be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The Authorized Participant may\nrequest the redeeming investor of the Shares to complete an order form or to enter into agreements with\nrespect to such matters as compensating\ncash payment. Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a \u0093qualified institutional buyer,\u0094 (\u0093QIB\u0094) as\nsuch term is defined under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, will not be able to receive Redemption\nSecurities that are\nrestricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A. An Authorized Participant may be required by the\nTrust to provide a written confirmation with respect to QIB status in order to receive Redemption\nSecurities.\n\nThe right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to a Fund (1) for any\nperiod during which the\nExchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (2) for any period during which\ntrading on the Exchange is suspended or restricted; (3) for any period during which an emergency exists as a\nresult of which disposal of the\nShares of the Fund or determination of the NAV of the Shares is not reasonably practicable; or (4) in such\nother circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\n\n3\n                                                                                                   \n  3)  The following replaces the first paragraph within the section entitled \u0093LOCAL MARKET HOLIDAY  \n      SCHEDULES\u0094:                                                                                   \n                                                                                                   \nThe Trust generally intends to effect deliveries of the Funds\u0092 portfolio securities on T+1.\nThe ability of the Trust to effect in-kind redemptions within one Business Day of receipt of a redemption\nrequest is subject, among other things, to the condition that, within the time period from the date of\nthe request to the date of delivery of the securities, there are no days that are local market holidays on\nthe relevant Business Days. For every occurrence of one or more intervening holidays in the local market\nthat are not holidays observed in the\nUnited States, the redemption settlement cycle may be extended by the number of such intervening local\nholidays. In addition to holidays, other unforeseeable closings in a foreign market due to emergencies may\nalso prevent the Trust from delivering\nsecurities within one Business Day.\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE\n\n052424SUPP3\n\n4\n"
