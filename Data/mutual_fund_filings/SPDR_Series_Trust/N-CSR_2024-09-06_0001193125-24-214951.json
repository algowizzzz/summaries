The reporting period\u2019s market         \nenvironment was largely driven by news about inflation, economic growth and the impact either would have on \nthe U.S. Federal Reserve (the \"Fed\") and other central banks with regard to interest rate decisions.        \nAlongside this macro story was the prospect of a burgeoning artificial intelligence boom, driving up the    \nvalues of AI-related tech and semiconductor companies. And markets continued to be dominated by the so-     \ncalled \"Magnificent Seven\", consisting of Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Meta Platforms Inc,      \nMicrosoft Corp, NVIDIA Corp and Tesla Inc. Compared to the Russell 1000 Index, which returned 23.88% during \nthe reporting period, the Fund significantly underperformed. The Fund's focus on higher yielding dividend   \nstocks had significant overlap with value stocks, which underperformed growth securities which in turn      \ncaptured the outperformance of AI-related tech and semiconductor companies, as well as the Magnificent      \nSeven. Because of this, value stocks significantly underperformed. The Fund also tilts towards stocks       \ncharacterized by the quality and size factors, but while the quality factor slightly outperformed, the size \nfactor underperformed, and the net impact to the Fund was negative.                                         \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

During the reporting period, Energy   \nwas the best performing sector within the portfolio, followed by Financials and Information Technology. At  \nthe same time, Consumer Staples was the worst performing sector, followed by Communication Services and     \nHealth Care. From a single stock perspective, NVDIA was the best performing security in the portfolio,      \nfollowed by Williams-Sonoma Inc and Constellation Energy. The worst performing security was Hertz Global,   \nfollowed by New York Community Bancorp and ViaSat. When we analyze the performance of the Russell 1000      \nMomentum Focus Index relative to the market capitalization weighted index, such as the Russell 1000 Index,  \nwe can see that the Factor Index underperformed the Russell 1000 over the reporting period. Most of the     \nunderperformance can be attributed to under-weight to Information Technology stocks, followed by            \nCommunication Services and Industrials. Under-weights to NVDIA Corp, Meta Platforms and Amazon Inc were the \nmain relative detractors. On the positive side, over-weights to Apple Inc and NRG Energy Inc added relative \nvalue, while under-weight to Tesla also contributed positively.                                             \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

Management fees, cash drag, and       \ncumulative effects of security mis-weights contributed to the difference between the Fund\u2019s performance and \nthat of the Index and were primary drivers of Fund performance during the period. During the reporting      \nperiod, the Energy sector was the best performing sector for this strategy, followed by Financials and      \nIndustrials. At the same time, Consumer Staples was the worst performing sector, followed by Communication  \nServices and Utilities. From a single stock perspective, Williams-Sonoma was the best performing security in\nthe Index, followed by NRG Energy Inc and SL Green Realty Corp. Hertz Global was the worst performing       \nsecurity in the Index, followed by New York Community Bancorp, Inc. and Leggett & Platt Inc. When we analyze\nthe performance for this Strategy relative to a market capitalization weighted index, such as the Russell   \n1000 Index, we can see that during the reporting period, the Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus Index trailed\nthe Russell 1000 Index. Most of this underperformance can be explained by the Factor index\u2019s underweight to \nInformation Security stocks, followed by Communication Services and overweight to the Consumer Staples      \nsector. From a single security perspective, the Factor Index did not hold NVDIA Corp., Meta Platforms and   \nAmazon Inc, which are the top 3 detractors from relative performance. Simultaneously, not including Apple   \nInc, Tesla Inc and Johnson & Johnson contributed positively.                                                \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

As 4Q23 began, markets seemed to      \nteeter on each economic release, and the heightened sensitivity combined with the geopolitical uncertainty  \nintroduced by the attacks of October 7th in Israel caused bond market yields to spike and markets to sell-  \noff in October. Concern about rate hikes turned into speculation about rate cuts and the possibility that   \nthe Fed might actually orchestrate an economic soft landing. This, combined with continued enthusiasm for   \nsemiconductor companies that investors believed would drive the impending A.I. revolution, induced markets  \nto resume their gains in the last two months of the calendar year. As markets wrestled with the Fed\u2019s slight\nbias towards hawkishness, A.I.-related semiconductor stocks continued to surge, revealing the investor      \nbelief that A.I. represented an enormous secular growth opportunity that transcended concerns about the     \nmacroeconomy. These and the Magnificent Seven once again pulled the market up with them into the end of the \nReporting Period, ultimately producing strong net gains for the year.                                       \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

U.S. Economic indicators from the U.S.\nremained relatively strong over the Q3 2023. While investors began the quarter with hopes that the rate     \nhikes would soon end and cuts would begin, that probability ended by the end of the quarter. U.S. stocks    \nrallied in the Q4 2023, supported by prospects of rate cuts in 2024. October\u2019s economic data had spooked    \ninvestors. However, things took a turn by November \u2013 inflation softened and the U.S. Federal Reserve (\u201cthe  \nFed\u201d) Chair\u2019s supportive comments shored up investor sentiment. U.S. equities rallied for a second straight \nquarter in the Q1 2024. At 10.4%, the S&P 500 Index posted its biggest first-quarter gain since 2019 and its\nfifth gain in the last six quarters. The AI theme was a key tailwinds in the Q1 2024. The biggest area of   \nconcern during the quarter revolved around sticky core services inflation even as the U.S. economy remained \nresilient. U.S. equity indices were mixed in the Q2 2024, with a tough start to the quarter in April.

The biggest area of concern during the     \nquarter revolved around sticky core services inflation even as the U.S. economy remained resilient. U.S.    \nequity indices were mixed in Q2 2024, with a tough start to the quarter in April. The momentum changed in   \nthe middle of the month due to a strong jobs report, ending up positive in May and June.

The reporting period\u2019s market         \nenvironment was largely driven by news about inflation, economic growth and the impact either would have on \nthe U.S. Federal Reserve (the \u201cFed\u201d) and other central banks with regard to interest rate decisions.        \nAlongside this macro story was the prospect of a burgeoning artificial intelligence boom, driving up the    \nvalues of AI-related tech and semiconductor companies. The reporting period began just after the so-called  \n\u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks began dominating U.S. market returns, thereby earning their catchy moniker.

The reporting period\u2019s market         \nenvironment was largely driven by news about inflation, economic growth and the impact either would have on \nthe Fed and other central banks with regard to interest rate decisions. Alongside this macro story was the  \nprospect of a burgeoning artificial intelligence boom, driving up the values of A.I.-related tech and       \nsemiconductor companies. A.I.-related semiconductor stocks continued to surge, revealing the investor belief\nthat A.I. represented an enormous secular growth opportunity that transcended concerns about the            \nmacroeconomy. These and the Magnificent Seven once again pulled the market up with them into the end of the \nreporting period, ultimately producing strong net gains for the year. The Fund used equity index futures in \norder to equitize cash and accruals during the reporting period. The Fund\u2019s use of futures helped the Fund  \ntrack the Index.                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

Performance was weak during the 1st   \nquarter of the fiscal year as challenging inflation prints contributed to reduced optimism regarding the    \ntiming and magnitude of Federal Reserve rate cuts. These rate concerns combined with signs that growth was  \nslowing led to the market\u2019s decline during the 1st quarter. Conversely, the 2nd quarter of the fiscal year  \nwas marked by a dramatic change in returns as the S&P 500 gained over 11% during this period. This was      \ndriven by better growth, incremental progress on the inflation front and AI related optimism. The second    \nhalf of the fiscal year continued the strong market returns from the second quarter. Though there were      \nconcerns regarding the stickiness of inflation during the early part of the period by the end of the period \nthe market was convinced that real inflation progress was occurring especially in regard to the last mile of\ninflation. There were other signs most notably in the labor market that perhaps the Federal Reserve was     \ngoing to pull of the challenging act of a soft landing. This combined with continued earnings growth and    \neven increasing levels of AI related optimism led to the market appreciating by over 15% over the final 2   \nquarters of the fiscal year.                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

The small cap Index picked up   \nanother 2.5% in the following quarter based on macroeconomic data that continued to highlight a strong US   \neconomy. In the second quarter of 2024, the Fed held the interest rates steady and struck a hawkish tone in \nJune that resulted in a decline of 3.1% of the S&P 600 Index for the second quarter of 2024.

The reporting period\u2019s market         \nenvironment was largely driven by news about inflation, economic growth and the impact either would have on \nthe Fed and other central banks with regard to interest rate decisions. Alongside this macro story was the  \nprospect of a burgeoning artificial intelligence boom, driving up the values of A.I.-related tech and       \nsemiconductor companies. And markets continued to be dominated by the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d,        \nconsisting of Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Meta Platforms Inc, Microsoft Corp, NVIDIA Corp and  \nTesla Inc. Compared with the S&P 500, which returned 24.56% during the reporting period, the Fund           \nunderperformed. Stocks with high dividend yields usually have substantial overlap with value stocks, and    \nbecause these value stocks were significantly outperformed by growth stocks which comprised securities such \nas the A.I.-related tech and semiconductor companies, as well as the Magnificent Seven, their relative      \nperformance suffered. As a result, the Fund\u2019s strategy underperformed the broader market during the         \nreporting period.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

As 4Q23 began, markets seemed to      \nteeter on each economic release, and the heightened sensitivity combined with the geopolitical uncertainty  \nintroduced by the attacks of October 7th in Israel caused bond market yields to spike and markets to sell-  \noff in October. Concern about rate hikes turned into speculation about rate cuts and the possibility that   \nthe Fed might actually orchestrate an economic soft landing. This, combined with continued enthusiasm for   \nsemiconductor companies that investors believed would drive the impending A.I. revolution, induced markets  \nto resume their gains in the last two months of the calendar year. As markets wrestled with the Fed\u2019s slight\nbias towards hawkishness, A.I.-related semiconductor stocks continued to surge, revealing the investor      \nbelief that A.I. represented an enormous secular growth opportunity that transcended concerns about the     \nmacroeconomy.

U.S. Economic indicators from the U.S.\nremained relatively strong over the Q3 2023. While investors began the quarter with hopes that the rate     \nhikes would soon end and cuts would begin, that probability ended by the end of the quarter. U.S. stocks    \nrallied in Q4 2023, supported by prospects of rate cuts in 2024. October\u2019s economic data had spooked        \ninvestors. However, things took a turn by November \u2013 inflation softened and the U.S. Federal Reserve (the   \n\u201cFed\u201d) Chair\u2019s supportive comments shored up investor sentiment. U.S. equities rallied for a second straight\nquarter in Q1 2024. At 10.4%, the S&P 500 index posted its biggest first-quarter gain since 2019 and its    \nfifth gain in the last six quarters. The AI theme was a key tailwind in Q1 2024. The biggest area of concern\nduring the quarter revolved around sticky core services inflation even as the U.S. economy remained         \nresilient. U.S. equity indices were mixed in Q2 2024, with a tough start to the quarter in April. The       \nmomentum changed in the middle of the month due to a strong jobs report, ending up positive in May and June.\nThe Fed held the interest rates steady and struck a hawkish tone in June, maintaining the current policy    \nrate and projecting only one rate cut in 2024.                                                              \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

In Q3 2023, the S&P Bank Select       \nIndustry Index returned 3.4% for the quarter. Global economic growth remained lackluster in the third       \nquarter, with manufacturing activities contracting for the fourth month running and services sector growth  \nalso slowing down.

Core inflation numbers showed a disinflationary trend, while the    \nlabor market continued to be relatively robust across key developed economies. Performance of the Fund      \nduring the reporting period was driven by strong labor markets, strong consumer spending, slowing inflation,\na pause in interest rate hikes, and concerns over a recession weighted on the minds of many investors. Bank \nstocks rose for the fiscal year.

The Fed held the interest rates steady and struck\na hawkish tone in June, maintaining the current policy rate and projecting only one rate cut in 2024.       \nLuckily, even the hope of possible future rate cuts helped the Regional Banking Industry to finish the      \nreporting period with strong positive returns.                                                              \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

The reporting period began with       \nuncertainty around economic growth, inflation and the Fed\u2019s stance on the direction of rates rattled some   \ninvestors who feared that the Fed would keep rates higher for longer. Despite the geopolitical uncertainty  \nintroduced by the attacks of October 7th in Israel, the ongoing trickle of indicators revealed that the     \neconomy was gradually beginning to slow, and the Fed managed to soothe investors by tempering its hawkish   \nlanguage. Concern about rate hikes turned into speculation about rate cuts. This, combined with continued   \nenthusiasm for semiconductor companies that investors believed would drive the impending A.I. revolution,   \ninduced markets to resume their gains.                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

After gaining close to 22% during the \nprior fiscal year, the Aerospace & Defense Industry continued that trajectory during this most recent fiscal\nyear by adding another 16.21%. Unlike the prior period, however, the Industry lagged the S&P 500 Index      \n(+24.56%) this time around. The more than 8% deficit is even more noteworthy given that the Industry        \nactually beat the broader index by close to 10% during the second fiscal quarter \u2013 the only quarter of      \noutperformance throughout the fiscal period. The quarterly outperformance stemmed from business aviation    \nusage hitting 20% above pre-COVID levels (according to data tracker WingX Advance) and the passing of the   \nNational Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that will allocate $886 billion to national security in 2024.     \nOverall, defense stocks paralleled the S&P 500 for the most part while Aerospace stocks played the role of  \nlaggard. This was led by Virgin Galactic (-89.14%) who announced the discontinuance of their Unity          \nspacecraft venture. Boeing (-12.63%) also had an unfortunate year that not only saw manufacturing problems  \ninterrupting production of both their 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner, but also in-flight malfunctions,          \nwhistleblowing, and regulatory scrutiny.                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

The reporting period\u2019s market         \nenvironment was largely driven by news about inflation, economic growth and the impact either would have on \nthe Federal Reserve and other central banks with regard to interest rate decisions. Alongside this macro    \nstory was the prospect of a burgeoning artificial intelligence boom, driving up the values of A.I.-related  \ntech and semiconductor companies. A spike in the price of oil driven by higher demand also contributed to a \ncomplex economic situation. The higher prices were supported by increased demand for power generation,      \nreduced production in the U.S., and supply disruptions in Norway. Robust liquified natural gas demand from  \nAsia also boosted prices.                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The following is\na summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial\nstatements: The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Each\nFund is an investment company under U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting guidance applicable\nto investment companies. Security Valuation Each Fund's investments are valued at fair value each day that\nthe New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) is open and, for financial reporting purposes, as of the report date\nshould the reporting period end on a day that the NYSE is not open. Fair value is generally defined as the\nprice a fund would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. By its nature, a fair value price is a good faith estimate of\nthe valuation in a current sale and may not reflect an actual market price. The investments of each Fund are\nvalued pursuant to the policy and procedures developed by the Oversight Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) and\napproved by the Board. The Committee provides oversight of the valuation of investments for the Funds. The\nBoard has responsibility for overseeing the determination of the fair value of investments.

A futures contract is a           \nstandardized, exchange-traded agreement to buy or sell a financial instrument at a set price on a future    \ndate. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund is required to deposit with the broker, cash or         \nsecurities in an amount equal to the minimum initial margin requirements of the clearing house. Securities  \ndeposited, if any, are designated on the Schedules of Investments and cash deposited, if any, is included in\nNet cash at broker on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Subsequent payments are made or received by \nthe Funds equal to the daily change in the contract value, accumulated, exchange rates, and or other        \ntransactional fees. The accumulation of those payments are recorded as variation margin receivable or       \npayable with a corresponding offset to unrealized gains                                                     \n                                                    171                                                     \nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) June 30, 2024\n\nor losses. The Funds recognize a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed. Losses may arise if the\nvalue of a futures contract decreases due to unfavorable changes in the market rates or values of the\nunderlying instrument during the term of the contract or if the counterparty does not perform under the\ncontract. The use of futures contracts also involves the risk that the movements in the price of the futures\ncontracts do not correlate with the movement of the assets underlying such contracts.

Shareholder Transactions Each Fund issues and redeems its shares, at NAV, by each Fund only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares or multiples thereof (\u201cCreation Units\u201d). Except when aggregated\nin Creation Units, shares of each Fund are not redeemable. Transactions in capital shares for each Fund are\ndisclosed in detail in the Statements of Changes in Net Assets. The consideration for the purchase of\nCreation Units of a Fund may consist of the in-kind deposit of a designated portfolio of securities and a\nspecified amount of cash. Investors purchasing and redeeming Creation Units may pay a purchase transaction\nfee and a redemption transaction fee directly to the Trust and/or custodian, to offset transfer and other\ntransaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units, including Creation Units\nfor cash. An additional variable fee may be charged for certain transactions. Such variable charges, if any,\nare included in \u201cOther Capital\u201d on the Statements of Changes in Net Assets. 8. Income Tax Information The\nFunds have qualified and intend to continue to qualify as regulated investment companies under Subchapter M\nof the Internal Revenue Code. The Funds will not be subject to federal income taxes to the extent it\ndistributes its taxable income, including any net realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. Therefore,\nno provision for federal income tax is required. The Funds file federal and various state and local tax\nreturns as required. No income tax returns are currently under examination. Generally, the federal returns\nare subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years from date of filing,\nwhile the state returns may remain open for an additional year depending upon jurisdiction. SSGA FM has\nanalyzed each Fund's tax positions taken on tax returns for all open years and does not believe there are\nany uncertain tax positions that would require recognition of a tax liability. Distributions to shareholders\nare recorded on ex-dividend date. Income dividends and gain distributions are determined in accordance with\nincome tax rules and regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Certain\ncapital accounts in the financial statements have been adjusted for permanent book-tax differences. These\nadjustments have no impact on NAV or results of operations. Temporary book-tax differences will reverse in\nthe future. These book-tax differences are primarily due to differing treatments for character of\ndistributions, in-kind transactions, foreign currency gains and losses, passive foreign investment\ncompanies, partnerships, corporate actions, forward contracts mark to market, futures contracts mark to\nmarket, return of capital basis adjustments, wash sale loss deferrals and distributions in excess of current\nearnings.\n\n176\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) June 30, 2024\n\nThe tax character of distributions paid during the year ended June 30, 2024,

Securities Lending Each Fund may lend securities to qualified broker-dealers or institutional investors.\nThe loans are secured at all times by cash, cash equivalents or U.S. government securities in an amount at\nleast equal to the market value of the securities loaned, plus accrued interest and dividends, determined on\na daily basis and adjusted accordingly. The value of the collateral with respect to a loaned security may be\ntemporarily more or less than the value of a security due to market fluctuations of securities values. With\nrespect to each loan, if on any U.S. business day the aggregate market value of securities collateral plus\ncash collateral is less than the aggregate market value of the securities which are subject to the loan, the\nborrower will be notified to provide additional collateral on the next business day. The Funds will regain\nrecord ownership of loaned securities to exercise certain beneficial rights; however, the Funds may bear the\nrisk of delay in recovery of, or even loss of rights in the securities loaned should the borrower fail\nfinancially. In addition, a Fund will bear the risk of loss of any cash collateral that it may invest. Each\nFund receives compensation for lending its securities from interest or dividends earned on the cash, cash\nequivalents or U.S. government securities held as collateral, net of fee rebates paid to the borrower and\nnet of fees paid to State Street as the lending agent. Additionally, a Fund will receive a fee from the\nborrower for non-cash collateral equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. The\nmarket value of securities on loan as of June 30, 2024, and the value of the invested cash collateral are\ndisclosed in the Funds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Non-cash collateral is not disclosed in the\nFunds Statements of Assets and Liabilities as it is held by the lending agent on behalf of the Funds, and\nthe Funds do not\n\n179\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) June 30, 2024\n\nhave the ability to re-hypothecate those securities. Securities lending income, as disclosed in the Funds\nStatements of Operations, represents the income earned from the non-cash collateral and the investment of\ncash collateral, net of fee rebates paid to the borrower and net of fees paid to State Street as lending\nagent.

Risks Concentration Risk As a result of the Funds' ability to invest a large percentage of their assets\nin obligations of issuers within the same country, state, region, currency or economic sector, an adverse\neconomic, business or political development may affect the value of the Funds' investments more than if the\nFunds were more broadly diversified. Credit Risk A Fund may be exposed to credit risk in the event that an\nissuer or guarantor fails to perform or that an institution or entity with which the Fund has unsettled or\nopen transactions default. Market Risk Each Fund's investments are subject to changes in general economic\nconditions, and general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of investments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, changes in the\nactual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and general market liquidity. Each Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and adversely affect global economies and\nmarkets. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness,\nsuch as COVID-19, or other public health issues, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments. Russian Sanctions Risk Sanctions threatened or imposed by a number of jurisdictions,\nincluding the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom, and other intergovernmental actions\nthat have been or may be undertaken in the future, against Russia, Russian entities or Russian individuals,\nmay result in the devaluation of Russian currency, a downgrade in the country\u2019s credit rating, an immediate\nfreeze of Russian assets, a decline in the value and liquidity of Russian securities, property or interests,\nand/or other adverse consequences to the Russian economy or a Fund.

management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds\u2019 financial statements based on our audits. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that\nwe plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free\nof material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of the Trust\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits\nwe are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of\nsecurities owned as of June 30, 2024, by correspondence with the custodian, brokers and others; when replies\nwere not received from brokers and others, we performed other auditing procedures. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion. We have served as the auditor of one or more State Street Global Advisors\ninvestment companies since 2000.

In \ndeciding whether to approve the Advisory Agreement, the Board considered various factors, including the     \nnature, extent and quality of services provided by the Adviser with respect to the SPDR ETFs under the      \nAgreement, the proposed cost of those services in relation to the services provided and in relation to fees \ncharged to comparable funds, other benefits to the Adviser of its relationship with the SPDR ETFs, and      \nextent to which economies of scale would be shared as the SPDR ETFs grow.                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Nature, Extent and Quality of Services                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board considered the nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Adviser. In doing so, the   \nTrustees relied on their prior experience in overseeing the management of the Trusts and the materials      \nprovided prior to and at the meeting. The Board reviewed the Advisory Agreement and the Adviser\u2019s           \nresponsibilities for managing investment operations of each of the SPDR ETFs in accordance with each SPDR   \nETF\u2019s investment objectives and policies, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The Board       \nappreciated the nature of the SPDR ETFs as exchange-traded funds and the experience and expertise of the    \nAdviser in managing exchange-traded funds. The Board considered the background and experience of the        \nAdviser\u2019s senior management, including those individuals responsible for portfolio management, oversight of \nsub-advisers and regulatory compliance of the SPDR ETFs. The Board also considered the portfolio management \nresources, structures and practices of the Adviser, including those associated with monitoring and ensuring \neach SPDR ETF\u2019s compliance with its investment objectives and policies, and applicable laws and regulations.\nThe Board further considered information about the Adviser\u2019s best execution procedures and overall          \ninvestment management business, noting that the Adviser serves a wide range of clients across a broad       \nspectrum of asset classes. The Board looked at the Adviser\u2019s general knowledge of the investment management \nbusiness and that of its affiliates which make up State Street Global Advisors, through which the Adviser   \nshares all of its senior personnel. The Board considered that the Adviser and its affiliates constitute one \nof the world\u2019s largest investment management enterprises for indexed products generally and exchange-traded \nfunds in particular. The Board specifically considered the Adviser\u2019s experience in managing equity exchange-\ntraded funds with index-based investment objectives.                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n  Investment Performance                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board then reviewed the SPDR ETFs\u2019 performance, noting that the analysis of investment performance, in  \nabsolute terms, was more complex for the actively-managed funds. The Board focused on the extent to which   \neach index-based SPDR ETF achieved its objective as a passively-managed index fund and reviewed information \nregarding such SPDR ETF\u2019s index tracking. To the extent such tracking was not consistent with management\u2019s  \nexpectations, the Trustees sought additional information about steps being taken to address the positive or \nnegative tracking differences.                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Profits Realized by Adviser                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board considered the profitability of the advisory arrangement with the SPDR ETFs to the Adviser and its\naffiliates, including data on each SPDR ETF\u2019s historical profitability to these entities. The Board,        \nincluding the Independent Trustees, with their independent legal counsel, had the opportunity to discuss,   \nwith representatives of the Adviser and State Street Global Advisors, methodologies used in computing costs \nthat formed the bases of profitability calculations.                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n  Fees Charged to Comparable Funds                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board evaluated each SPDR ETF\u2019s unitary fee through review of comparative information with respect to   \nfees paid by similar funds \u2013 i.e., exchange-traded funds tracking similar equity indexes with respect to    \neach series of SST. The Board reviewed the universe of similar exchange-traded funds for each SPDR ETF based\nupon data independently obtained from Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (Broadridge) nd related          \ncomparative information for similar exchange-traded funds. In doing so, the Board used a fund by fund       \nanalysis of the data. In certain                                                                            \n                                                    187                                                     \nTable of Contents                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nSPDR SERIES TRUST                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nSTATEMENT REGARDING BASIS FOR APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY CONTRACT (continued)                          \n                                                                                                            \nJune 30, 2024 (Unaudited)                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \ninstances as considered appropriate by the Board, the Board explored with management the reasons for the    \ndifferences between a SPDR ETF\u2019s fee and fees paid by similar funds.                                        \n                                                                                                            \n  Other Benefits                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board also considered whether the Adviser or its affiliates benefited in other ways from its            \nrelationship with the Trust, noting that the Adviser does not maintain soft-dollar arrangements in          \nconnection with the Trust\u2019s brokerage transactions.                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n  Economies of Scale                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board reviewed information regarding economies of scale or other efficiencies that may result as each   \nSPDR ETF\u2019s assets grow in size. The Board noted that the advisory fee rate for each SPDR ETF does not       \nprovide for breakpoints as assets of the SPDR ETF increase. However, the Board further noted the Adviser\u2019s  \nassertion that future economies of scale (among several factors) had been taken into consideration for the  \nSPDR ETFs by fixing relatively low advisory fees, effectively sharing the benefits of lower fees with the   \nSPDR ETFs from inception. The Adviser also asserted that one of the benefits of the unitary fee was to      \nprovide an unvarying expense structure, which could be lost or diluted with the addition of breakpoints. The\nBoard noted that it intends to continue to monitor fees as the SPDR ETFs grow in size and assess whether fee\nbreakpoints may be warranted.                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n  Conclusion                                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nAfter weighing the foregoing factors, none of which was dispositive in itself and may have been weighed     \ndifferently by each Trustee, the Board, including the Independent Trustees voting separately, approved the  \ncontinuation of the Advisory Agreement for each SPDR ETF. In approving the continuance of each Advisory     \nAgreement, the Board, including the Independent Trustees voting separately, found that the terms of each    \nAdvisory Agreement are fair and reasonable and that the continuance of the Advisory Agreement is in the best\ninterests of the applicable SPDR ETF and its shareholders.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The following is a summary of\nsignificant accounting policies followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements: The\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S.\nGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Each Fund is an\ninvestment company under U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting guidance applicable to\ninvestment companies. Security Valuation Each Fund's investments are valued at fair value each day that the\nNew York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) is open and, for financial reporting purposes, as of the report date should\nthe reporting period end on a day that the NYSE is not open. Fair value is generally defined as the price a\nfund would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. By its nature, a fair value price is a good faith estimate of the\nvaluation in a current sale and may not reflect an actual market price. The investments of each Fund are\nvalued pursuant to the policy and procedures developed by the Oversight Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) and\napproved by the Board. The Committee provides oversight of the valuation of investments for the Funds. The\nBoard has responsibility for overseeing the determination of the fair value of investments. Valuation\ntechniques used to value each Fund\u2019s investments by major category are as follows: \u2022 Equity investments\n(including preferred stocks and registered investment companies that are exchange-traded funds) traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last sale\nprice or official closing price, as applicable, on the primary market or exchange on which they trade.\nEquity investments traded on a recognized exchange for which there were no sales on that day are valued 118\nTable of Contents                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nSPDR SERIES TRUST                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nJune 30, 2024                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nat the last published sale price or at fair value.                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Rights and warrants are valued at the last reported sale price obtained from independent pricing services\nor brokers on the valuation date.

Derivative Financial Instruments Futures Contracts The Funds may enter into futures contracts to meet the\nFunds' objectives. A futures contract is a standardized, exchange-traded agreement to buy or sell a\nfinancial instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund is\nrequired to deposit with the broker, cash or securities in an amount equal to the minimum initial margin\nrequirements of the clearing house. Securities deposited, if any, are designated on the Schedules of\nInvestments and cash deposited, if any, is included in Net cash at broker on the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. Subsequent payments are made or received by a Fund equal to the daily change in the contract\nvalue, accumulated, exchange rates, and or other transactional fees. The accumulation of those payments are\nrecorded as variation margin receivable or payable with a corresponding offset to unrealized gains or\nlosses. A Fund recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed. Losses may arise if the value\nof a futures contract decreases due to unfavorable changes in the market rates or values of the underlying\ninstrument during the term of the contract or if the counterparty does not perform under the contract. The\nuse of futures contracts also involves the risk that the movements in the price of the futures contracts do\nnot correlate with the movement of the assets underlying such contracts.

Swap agreements are\nprivately negotiated in the OTC market and may be entered into as a bilateral contract (\u201cBL OTC\u201d) or\ncentrally cleared (\u201ccentrally cleared swaps\u201d). Swaps are marked-to-market daily and changes in value are\nrecorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation). A BL OTC swap is a transaction between a fund and dealer\ncounterparty where cash flows are exchanged between the two parties for the life of the swap. For BL OTC\nswaps, any upfront premiums paid are recorded as assets and any upfront fees received are recorded as\nliabilities and are shown as swap contracts premiums paid and swap contracts premiums received,\nrespectively, in the Statements of Assets and Liabilities and amortized to realized gain/loss ratably over\nthe term of the BL OTC swap. Payments received or made by the Fund for BL OTC swaps are recorded in the\nStatement of Operations as realized gains or losses, respectively. When a BL OTC swap is terminated, a Fund\nwill record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the proceeds from (or cost of) the\nclosing transaction and the Fund\u2019s basis in the contract, if any. Generally, the basis of the contracts is\nthe premium received or paid. A centrally cleared OTC swap is a transaction executed between a fund and a\ndealer counterparty, then cleared by a futures commission merchant (FCM) through a clearinghouse. Once\ncleared, the clearinghouse serves as a central counterparty (\u201cCCP\u201d), with whom a fund exchanges cash flows\nfor the life of the transaction, similar to transactions in futures contracts.\n\n121\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) June 30, 2024\n\nA Fund is required to interface with the CCP through a broker. Upon entering into a centrally cleared swap,\nthe Fund is required to deposit initial margin with the broker in the form of cash or securities in an\namount that varies depending on the size and risk profile of the particular swap. Securities deposited as\ninitial margin if any, are designated on the Schedule of Investments and cash deposited is segregated and\nrecorded on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as Payable for Collateral for the Total Return Swaps.\nThe daily change in valuation of centrally cleared swaps is recorded as a receivable or payable for\nvariation margin in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Payments received from (paid to) the\ncounterparty, including at termination, are recorded as realized gain (loss) in the Statement of Operations.\nFor both bi-lateral and centrally cleared OTC swaps, payments are exchanged at specified intervals, accrued\ndaily commencing with the effective date of the contract and recorded as realized gain or (loss). Some swaps\nmay be terminated prior to the effective date and realize a gain or loss upon termination. Total Return\nSwaps The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF Fund has entered into total return swaps to obtain investment exposures that\nthe Adviser expects to correlate closely with the Index or a portion of the Index. Total return swaps are\nagreements in which there is an exchange of cash flows whereby one party commits to make payments on the\ntotal return (coupon plus capital gains/losses) of an underlying instrument in exchange for fixed or\nfloating rate interest payments. To the extent the total return of the instrument or index underlying the\ntransaction exceeds or falls short of the offsetting interest rate obligation, the Fund will receive a\npayment or make a payment to the counterparty. For the year ended June 30, 2024, the Fund entered into total\nreturn swap contracts for cash equitization, to reduce tracking error and to facilitate daily liquidity.

Except when aggregated\nin Creation Units, shares of each Fund are not redeemable. Transactions in capital shares for each Fund are\ndisclosed in detail in the Statements of Changes in Net Assets. The consideration for the purchase of\nCreation Units of a Fund may consist of the in-kind deposit of a designated portfolio of securities and a\nspecified amount of cash. Investors purchasing and redeeming Creation Units may pay a purchase transaction\nfee and a redemption transaction fee directly to the Trust and/or custodian, to offset transfer and other\ntransaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units, including Creation Units\nfor cash. An additional variable fee may be charged for certain transactions. Such variable charges, if any,\nare included in \u201cOther Capital\u201d on the Statements of Changes in Net Assets. 8. Income Tax Information The\nFunds have qualified and intend to continue to qualify as regulated investment companies under Subchapter M\nof the Internal Revenue Code. Each Fund will not be subject to federal income taxes to the extent it\ndistributes its taxable income, including any net realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. Therefore,\nno provision for federal income tax is required. SPDR Portfolio S&P Sector Neutral Dividend ETF intends to\nqualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Funds file\nfederal and various state and local tax returns as required. No income tax returns are currently under\nexamination. Generally, the federal returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a\nperiod of three years from date of filing, while the state returns may remain open for an additional year\ndepending upon jurisdiction. SSGA FM has analyzed each Fund's tax positions taken on tax returns for all\nopen years and does not believe there are any uncertain tax positions that would require recognition of a\ntax liability. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on ex-dividend date. Income dividends and gain\ndistributions are determined in accordance with income tax rules and regulations, which may differ from\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\n\n126\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) June 30, 2024\n\nCertain capital accounts in the financial statements have been adjusted for permanent book-tax differences.\nThese adjustments have no impact on NAV or results of operations. Temporary book-tax differences will\nreverse in the future.

Securities Lending Each Fund may lend securities to qualified broker-dealers or institutional investors.\nThe loans are secured at all times by cash, cash equivalents or U.S. government securities in an amount at\nleast equal to the market value of the securities loaned, plus accrued interest and dividends, determined on\na daily basis and adjusted accordingly. The value of the collateral with respect to a loaned security may be\ntemporarily more or less than the value of a security due to market fluctuations of securities values. With\nrespect to each loan, if on any U.S. business day the aggregate market value of securities collateral plus\ncash collateral is less than the aggregate market value of the securities which are subject to the loan, the\nborrower will be notified to provide additional collateral on the next business day. The Funds will regain\nrecord ownership of loaned securities to exercise certain beneficial rights; however, the Funds may bear the\nrisk of delay in recovery of, or even loss of rights in the securities loaned should the borrower fail\nfinancially. In addition, a Fund will bear the risk of loss of any cash collateral that it may invest. Each\nFund receives compensation for lending its securities from interest or dividends earned on the cash, cash\nequivalents or U.S. government securities held as collateral, net of fee rebates paid to the borrower and\nnet of fees paid to State Street as the lending agent. Additionally, a Fund will receive a fee from the\nborrower for non-cash collateral equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. The\nmarket value of securities on loan as of June 30, 2024, and the value of the invested cash collateral are\ndisclosed in the Funds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Non-cash collateral is not disclosed in the\nFunds Statements of Assets and Liabilities as it is held by the lending agent on behalf of the Funds, and\nthe Funds do not have the ability to re-hypothecate those securities. Securities lending income, as\ndisclosed in the Funds Statements of Operations, represents the income earned from the non-cash collateral\nand the investment of cash collateral, net of fee rebates paid to the borrower and net of fees paid to State\nStreet as lending agent.\n\n129\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) June 30, 2024\n\nThe following is a

The scope and scale of sanctions in place at a particular time may be        \nexpanded or otherwise modified in a way that have negative effects on a Fund.

Sanctions could also     \nresult in Russia taking counter measures or other actions in response, which may further impair the value   \nand liquidity of Russian securities.

management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds\u2019 financial statements based on our audits. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that\nwe plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free\nof material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of the Trust\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits\nwe are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of\nsecurities owned as of June 30, 2024, by correspondence with the custodian, brokers and others; when replies\nwere not received from brokers and others, we performed other auditing procedures. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

(the      \n\u201cAdviser\u201d or \u201cSSGA FM\u201d) with respect to the equity series of SST (collectively, the \u201cSPDR ETFs\u201d). The       \nTrustees who are not \u201cinterested persons\u201d of the Trust within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of  \n1940, as amended (the \u201cIndependent Trustees\u201d), also met separately to consider the Agreement. The           \nIndependent Trustees were advised by their independent legal counsel throughout the process.                \n                                                                                                            \nTo evaluate the Advisory Agreement, the Board requested and SSGA FM, the Trust\u2019s adviser and administrator, \nand State Street Bank and Trust Company, the Trust\u2019s sub-administrator, transfer agent and custodian (\u201cState\nStreet\u201d) provided, such materials as the Board, with the advice of counsel, deemed reasonably necessary. In \ndeciding whether to approve the Advisory Agreement, the Board considered various factors, including the     \nnature, extent and quality of services provided by the Adviser with respect to the SPDR ETFs under the      \nAgreement, the proposed cost of those services in relation to the services provided and in relation to fees \ncharged to comparable funds, other benefits to the Adviser of its relationship with the SPDR ETFs, and      \nextent to which economies of scale would be shared as the SPDR ETFs grow.                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Nature, Extent and Quality of Services                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board considered the nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Adviser. In doing so, the   \nTrustees relied on their prior experience in overseeing the management of the Trusts and the materials      \nprovided prior to and at the meeting. The Board reviewed the Advisory Agreement and the Adviser\u2019s           \nresponsibilities for managing investment operations of each of the SPDR ETFs in accordance with each SPDR   \nETF\u2019s investment objectives and policies, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The Board       \nappreciated the nature of the SPDR ETFs as exchange-traded funds and the experience and expertise of the    \nAdviser in managing exchange-traded funds. The Board considered the background and experience of the        \nAdviser\u2019s senior management, including those individuals responsible for portfolio management, oversight of \nsub-advisers and regulatory compliance of the SPDR ETFs. The Board also considered the portfolio management \nresources, structures and practices of the Adviser, including those associated with monitoring and ensuring \neach SPDR ETF\u2019s compliance with its investment objectives and policies, and applicable laws and regulations.\nThe Board further considered information about the Adviser\u2019s best execution procedures and overall          \ninvestment management business, noting that the Adviser serves a wide range of clients across a broad       \nspectrum of asset classes. The Board looked at the Adviser\u2019s general knowledge of the investment management \nbusiness and that of its affiliates which make up State Street Global Advisors, through which the Adviser   \nshares all of its senior personnel. The Board considered that the Adviser and its affiliates constitute one \nof the world\u2019s largest investment management enterprises for indexed products generally and exchange-traded \nfunds in particular. The Board specifically considered the Adviser\u2019s experience in managing equity exchange-\ntraded funds with index-based investment objectives.                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n  Investment Performance                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board then reviewed the SPDR ETFs\u2019 performance, noting that the analysis of investment performance, in  \nabsolute terms, was more complex for the actively-managed funds. The Board focused on the extent to which   \neach index-based SPDR ETF achieved its objective as a passively-managed index fund and reviewed information \nregarding such SPDR ETF\u2019s index tracking. To the extent such tracking was not consistent with management\u2019s  \nexpectations, the Trustees sought additional information about steps being taken to address the positive or \nnegative tracking differences.                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Profits Realized by Adviser                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board considered the profitability of the advisory arrangement with the SPDR ETFs to the Adviser and its\naffiliates, including data on each SPDR ETF\u2019s historical profitability to these entities. The Board,        \nincluding the Independent Trustees, with their independent legal counsel, had the opportunity to discuss,   \nwith representatives of the Adviser and State Street Global Advisors, methodologies used in computing costs \nthat formed the bases of profitability calculations.                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n  Fees Charged to Comparable Funds                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board evaluated each SPDR ETF\u2019s unitary fee through review of comparative information with respect to   \nfees paid by similar funds \u2013 i.e., exchange-traded funds tracking similar equity indexes with respect to    \neach series of SST. The Board reviewed the universe of similar exchange-traded funds for each SPDR ETF based\nupon data independently obtained from Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.

The Board noted that the advisory fee rate for each SPDR ETF does not       \nprovide for breakpoints as assets of the SPDR ETF increase. However, the Board further noted the Adviser\u2019s  \nassertion that future economies of scale (among several factors) had been taken into consideration for the  \nSPDR ETFs by fixing relatively low advisory fees, effectively sharing the benefits of lower fees with the   \nSPDR ETFs from inception. The Adviser also asserted that one of the benefits of the unitary fee was to      \nprovide an unvarying expense structure, which could be lost or diluted with the addition of breakpoints. The\nBoard noted that it intends to continue to monitor fees as the SPDR ETFs grow in size and assess whether fee\nbreakpoints may be warranted.                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n  Conclusion                                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nAfter weighing the foregoing factors, none of which was dispositive in itself and may have been weighed     \ndifferently by each Trustee, the Board, including the Independent Trustees voting separately, approved the  \ncontinuation of the Advisory Agreement for each SPDR ETF. In approving the continuance of each Advisory     \nAgreement, the Board, including the Independent Trustees voting separately, found that the terms of each    \nAdvisory Agreement are fair and reasonable and that the continuance of the Advisory Agreement is in the best\ninterests of the applicable SPDR ETF and its shareholders. The Board\u2019s conclusions with respect to the      \nfactors were as follows: (a) the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the Adviser with    \nrespect to the SPDR ETFs were appropriate; (b) the performance and, more importantly for those SPDR ETFs    \nmeasured against an index, the index tracking, of each SPDR ETF had been satisfactory or the Adviser had    \ndemonstrated due attention to the remediation of underperformance, where appropriate; (c) the Adviser\u2019s     \nunitary fee for each SPDR ETF considered in relation to the services provided, and in relation to the fees  \ncharged to comparable funds, was reasonable; (d) the profitability of the Trust\u2019s relationships with the    \nAdviser and its affiliates was not excessive in view of the nature, extent and quality of the services      \nprovided; (e) any additional potential benefits to the Adviser or its affiliates were not of a magnitude to \nmaterially affect the Board\u2019s conclusions; and (f) the fees paid to the Adviser adequately shared the       \neconomies of scale with respect to the SPDR ETFs by way of the relatively low fee structure of the Trust.   \nThe Independent Trustees were advised by their independent counsel throughout the process.                  \n                                                    137                                                     \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                                          \u2502\n\u2502  Item\u20098.
