A Fund\u2019s per\nshare NAV is\nthe value of one share of a Fund and is\ncalculated by dividing the value of total\nassets less total liabilities by the number of\nshares outstanding. The NAV return is based on\nthe NAV of a Fund and the market return is\nbased on the market price per\nshare of a Fund. The market price used to\ncalculate the market return is determined by\nusing the midpoint between the highest bid and\nthe lowest offer on the exchange on which the\nshares of a Fund are listed for trading, as of\nthe time that a\nFund\u2019s NAV is calculated. NAV and market\nreturns assume that dividends and capital gain\ndistributions have been reinvested in a Fund\nat NAV. Market returns do not include\nbrokerage commissions that may be payable on\nsecondary market\ntransactions. If brokerage commissions were\nincluded market returns would be lower.\n\nAn index is a statistical measure of a\nspecified financial\nmarket or sector. An index does not actually\nhold a portfolio of securities and therefore\ndoes not reflect deductions for fees or\nexpenses. In comparison, a Fund\u2019s performance\nis negatively impacted by these deductions.\nIndex returns reflect\nall items of income, gain and loss and the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\n\nThe Bloomberg EM Local Currency Government\nDiversified\nIndex is designed to measure the performance\nof the fixed-rate local currency sovereign\ndebt of emerging market countries. The index\nincludes government bonds issued by investment\ngrade and non-investment grade countries\noutside the United States,\nin local currencies, that have a remaining\nmaturity of one year or more and are rated\nB3/B-/B- or higher using the middle rating of\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc., Standard &\nPoor\u2019s Financial Services, LLC and Fitch Inc.,\nrespectively.\n\nThe Bloomberg Global Aggregate ex-USD\n>$1B: Corporate Bond Index is designed to be a\nbroad based measure of the global investment-\ngrade, fixed rate, fixed income corporate\nmarkets outside the United States. The index\nis part of the Bloomberg Global ex-USD\nAggregate Bond Index (the\n\u201cAggregate Index\u201d). The major components of\nthe Aggregate Index are the Pan-European\nAggregate and the Asian Pacific Aggregate\nIndices. The securities in the index must have\na $1 billion USD equivalent market\ncapitalization outstanding\nand at least 1 year remaining. Securities must\nbe fixed rate, although zero coupon bonds and\nstep-ups are permitted. Additionally,\nsecurities must be rated investmen grade\n(Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or better) using the middle\nrating from Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service, Inc., Fitch Inc.,or\nStandard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services, LLC.\nafter dropping the highest and lowest\navailable ratings. If only two agencies rate a\nsecurity, then the more conservative (lower)\nrating will be used. If\nonly one rating agency rates a security, then\nthat one rating will be used. Excluded from\nthe index are subordinated debts, convertible\nsecurities, floating-rate notes, fixed-rate\nperpetuals, warrants, inflation-linked bonds\nand structured notes.\nThe index is market capitalization weighted\nand the securities in the index are updated on\nthe last business day of each month.\n\nThe Bloomberg Global Treasury ex-US Capped\nIndex is\ndesigned to track the fixed-rate local\ncurrency sovereign debt of investment grade\ncountries outside the United States. The index\nincludes government bonds issued by investment\ngrade countries outside the United States, in\nlocal currencies, that\nhave a remaining maturity of one year or more\nand are rated investment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB-\nor higher using the middle rating of Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor\u2019s,\nInc. and Fitch Inc., respectively). The index\nis\ncalculated by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\nusing a modified \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d\nmethodology. This design ensures that each\nconstituent country within the index is\nrepresented in a proportion consistent with\nits percentage with\nrespect to the total market capitalization of\nthe index. The index is rebalanced on a\nmonthly basis.\n\nThe Bloomberg 1-3 Year Global Treasury ex-US\nCapped Index\nis designed to measure the performance of\nfixed-rate local currency sovereign debt of\ninvestment grade countries outside the United\nStates that have remaining maturities of one\nto three years. The index includes government\nbonds issued by investment\ngrade countries outside the United States, in\nlocal currencies, that have remaining\nmaturities of one to three years and are rated\ninvestment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or higher\nusing the middle rating of Moody\u2019s Investors\nService, Inc., Standard\n& Poor\u2019s, Inc. and Fitch Inc., respectively).\nThe securities in the index must be fixed-rate\nand have certain minimum amounts outstanding,\ndepending upon the currency in which the bonds\nare denominated. The index is calculated by\nBloomberg\nIndex Services Limited using a modified\n\u201cmarket capitalization\u201d methodology. This\ndesign ensures that each constituent country\nwithin the index is represented in a\nproportion consistent with its percentage with\nrespect to the total\nmarket capitalization of the index. Component\nsecurities in each constituent country are\nrepresented in a proportion consistent with\ntheir percentage relative to the other\ncomponent securities in the constituent\ncountry. The securities in the index\nare updated monthly, on the last business day\nof each month.\n\nThe FTSE International Inflation-Linked\nSecurities Select\nIndex is designed to measure the total return\nperformance of inflation-linked bonds outside\nthe United States with fixed-rate coupon\npayments that are linked to an inflation\nindex. Inflation-protected public obligations\nof the inflation-linked\ngovernment bond markets of developed and\nemerging market countries, commonly known in\nthe United States as TIPS, are securities\nissued by such governments that are designed\nto provide inflation protection to investors.\nThe index includes government\ndebt (direct obligations of the issuer\ncountry) but does not include quasi-government\ndebt or corporate debt.\nSee accompanying notes to financial           \nstatements.                                   \n                      1                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \n    SPDR                                      \n    BLOOMBERG EMERGING MARKETS LOCAL BOND     \n    ETF                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       MANAGEMENT\u2019S                           \n       DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE         \n       (UNAUDITED)                            \n                                              \nThe SPDR\nBloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF (the\n\u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results\nthat, before fees and expenses, correspond\ngenerally to the price and yield performance\nof an index that tracks the fixed-rate local\ncurrency\nsovereign debt of emerging market countries.\nThe Fund\u2019s benchmark is the Bloomberg EM Local\nCurrency Government Diversified Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d).\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December\n31, 2022 (the \u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total\nreturn for the Fund was \u2013 11.89%, and the\nIndex was \u2013 12.73%. The\nFund and Index returns reflect the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing the Fund, including brokerage and\nadvisory expenses. The Index is unmanaged and\nIndex returns do not\nreflect fees and expenses of any kind, which\nwould have a negative impact on returns. Fees,\nexpenses, cash drag, taxes, and sampling\ncontributed to the difference between the\nFund\u2019s performance and that of the Index.\nGlobal concerns around heightened inflation,  \ntighter financial                             \nconditions, and the war in Ukraine were the   \nprimary drivers of Fund performance during the\nReporting Period. The Fund performed in line  \nwith expectations.                            \nIn order to reign in persistent inflation and\noverheated\neconomies across the globe, countries\u2019 central\nbanks began an about-face on previous easy\nmonetary policy, with many embarking on\naggressive rate hiking cycles. The European\nCentral bank and Bank of England raised\ninterest rates by 2.50% and\n3.25% respectively. Even the Bank of Japan,\nnotorious for uber-easy monetary policy,\nannounced that it would allow benchmark yields\nto rise to 0.50%, from the previous ceiling of\n0.25%. The effects of the hawkish pivot of\ndeveloped market central\nbanks spilled over into emerging market\ncountries, tightening fiscal conditions and\nstalling growth, ultimately leading to\nnegative returns.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia in the first\nquarter of\nthe year led to major index providers pricing\nRussia-related bonds at zero, essentially\nmaking them untradeable, before eventually\ndropping them from the index all together. The\nFund exited positions in Russia sovereigns in\nadvance of index exit at\na non-zero price, leading to a small pick-up\nin performance relative to the Index.\n\nMost emerging market debt sold off throughout\nthe year\nbefore recovering slightly in the fourth\nquarter. On a country specific level, the top\npositive contributors to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance on an absolute basis during the\nReporting Period were Turkey, Brazil, and\nChile bonds. The top negative\ncontributors to the Fund\u2019s performance on an\nabsolute basis during the Reporting Period\nwere Egypt, Russia, and Hungary bonds.\nThe Fund used forwards to manage currency     \nexposure during the                           \nReporting Period. The use of forwards helped  \nthe Fund track the Index.                     \nThe views expressed above reflect those of the\nFund\u2019s\nportfolio manager only through the Reporting\nPeriod, and do not necessarily represent the\nviews of the Adviser as a whole. Any such\nviews are subject to change at any time based\nupon market or other conditions and the\nAdviser disclaims any\nresponsibility to update such views. These\nviews may not be relied on as investment\nadvice and, because investment decisions for a\nfund are based on numerous factors, may not be\nrelied on as an indication of trading intent\non behalf of any fund.\nSee                                           \naccompanying notes to financial statements.   \n                      2                       \nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF\nPerformance Summary (Unaudited) Performance as\nof December 31, 2022\n                                              \n             Cum\u2026                Ave\u2026         \n             Tot\u2026                Ann\u2026         \n             Ret\u2026                Tot\u2026         \n                                 Ret\u2026         \n                   Blo\u2026                Bloo\u2026  \n                   EM                  EM     \n       Net   Mar\u2026  Loc\u2026    Net   Mar\u2026  Local  \n       Ass\u2026  Val\u2026  Cur\u2026    Ass\u2026  Val\u2026  Curr\u2026  \n       Val\u2026        Gov\u2026    Val\u2026        Gove\u2026  \n                   Div\u2026                Dive\u2026  \n                   Ind\u2026                Index  \n  ONE  (11\u2026  (11\u2026  (12\u2026    (11\u2026  (11\u2026  (12.\u2026  \n  YE\u2026                                         \n  FI\u2026  (14\u2026  (14\u2026  (12\u2026    (3.\u2026  (2.\u2026  (2.7\u2026  \n  YE\u2026                                         \n  TEN  (16\u2026  (17\u2026  (12\u2026    (1.\u2026  (1.\u2026  (1.3\u2026  \n  YE\u2026                                         \n                                              \nComparison of Change in Value of a $10,000\nInvestment\n(Based on Net Asset Value) Line graph is based\non cumulative total return.

The Fund\u2019s\nbenchmark is the Bloomberg 1-3 Year Global\nTreasury ex-US Capped Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d).\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December\n31, 2022 (the \u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total\nreturn for the Fund was \u2013 11.07%, and the\nIndex was \u2013 10.70%. The\nFund and Index returns reflect the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing the Fund, including brokerage and\nadvisory expenses. The Index is unmanaged and\nIndex returns do not\nreflect fees and expenses of any kind, which\nwould have a negative impact on returns. Fees,\nexpenses, cash drag, tax withholdings, and\nsampling contributed to the difference between\nthe Fund\u2019s performance and that of the index.\nGlobal concerns around heightened inflation,  \nchanges in                                    \ncentral bank policies, and the war in Ukraine \nwere the primary drivers of Fund performance  \nduring the Reporting Period. The Fund         \nperformed in line with expectations.          \nIn order to reign in persistent inflation and\noverheated\neconomies across the globe, countries\u2019 central\nbanks began an about-face on previous easy\nmonetary policy, with many embarking on\naggressive rate hiking cycles. The European\nCentral bank and Bank of England raised\ninterest rates by 2.50% and\n3.25% respectively. Even the Bank of Japan,\nnotorious for uber-easy monetary policy,\nannounced that it would allow benchmark yields\nto rise to 0.50%, from the previous ceiling of\n0.25%. The hawkish pivot of global central\nbanks roiled sovereign\nmarkets and sent yields soaring, leading to\nnegative returns within the sector.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia in the first\nquarter of\nthe year led to major index providers pricing\nRussia-related bonds at zero, essentially\nmaking them untradeable, before eventually\ndropping them from the index all together. The\nFund exited positions in Russia sovereigns in\nadvance of index exit at\na non-zero price, leading to a small pickup in\nperformance relative to the index.\n\nMost international sovereigns sold off\nthroughout the year\nbefore recovering slightly in the fourth\nquarter. On a country specific level, the top\npositive contributors to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance on an absolute basis during the\nReporting Period were Mexico, Peru, and Chile\ngovernment bonds. The top\nnegative contributors to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance on an absolute basis during the\nReporting Period were Russia, Turkey and\nHungary government bonds.\nThe Fund did not invest in derivatives during \nthe Reporting                                 \nPeriod.                                       \nThe views expressed above reflect those of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio manager only through the\nReporting Period, and do not necessarily\nrepresent the views of the Adviser as a whole.\nAny such views are subject to change at any\ntime based upon market or other conditions and\nthe Adviser\ndisclaims any responsibility to update such\nviews.

The Fund\u2019s benchmark is the\nFTSE International Inflation-Linked Securities\nSelect Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d).\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December\n31, 2022 (the \u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total\nreturn for the Fund was \u2013 15.41%, and the\nIndex was \u2013 14.78%. The\nFund and Index returns reflect the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing the Fund, including brokerage and\nadvisory expenses. The Index is unmanaged and\nIndex returns do not\nreflect fees and expenses of any kind, which\nwould have a negative impact on returns. Fees,\nexpenses, cash drag, tax withholdings and\nsampling contributed to the difference between\nthe Fund\u2019s performance and that of the index.\nGlobal concerns around heightened inflation,  \nchanges in                                    \ncentral bank policies, and the war in Ukraine \nwere the primary drivers of Fund performance  \nduring the Reporting Period. The Fund         \nperformed in line with expectations.          \nIn order to reign in persistent inflation and\noverheated\neconomies across the globe, countries\u2019 central\nbanks began an about-face on previous easy\nmonetary policy, with many embarking on\naggressive rate hiking cycles. The European\nCentral Bank and Bank of England raised\ninterest rates by 2.50% and\n3.25% respectively. Even the Bank of Japan,\nnotorious for uber-easy monetary policy,\nannounced that it would allow benchmark yields\nto rise to 0.50%, from the previous ceiling of\n0.25%. The hawkish pivot of global central\nbanks roiled sovereign\nmarkets and sent yields soaring, leading to\nnegative returns within the sector.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia in the first\nquarter of\nthe year did not directly affect the Fund or\nIndex performance as Russia inflation-linked\ngovernment bonds were not a part of the index\nto begin with. However, the war in Ukraine had\ncascading effects on market sentiment that\nincreased overall\nmarket volatility.\n\nMost international sovereigns sold\noff throughout the year before recovering\nslightly in the fourth quarter. On a country\nspecific level, the top positive contributors\nto the Fund\u2019s performance on an absolute basis\nduring the Reporting Period were Turkey,\nBrazil and Eurozone\ngovernment inflation-linked bonds. The top\nnegative contributors to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance on an absolute basis during the\nReporting Period were Chile, United Kingdom\nand Israel government inflation-linked bonds.\nThe Fund did not invest in derivatives during \nthe Reporting                                 \nPeriod.                                       \nThe views expressed above reflect those of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio manager only through the\nReporting Period, and do not necessarily\nrepresent the views of the Adviser as a whole.\nAny such views are subject to change at any\ntime based upon market or other conditions and\nthe Adviser\ndisclaims any responsibility to update such\nviews.

in aggregate gains and losses   \n  (c)  in securities for the fiscal period    \n       because of the timing of sales and     \n       repurchases of Fund shares in          \n       relation to

Distributions are     \n  (e)  assumed, for the purpose of this       \n       calculation, to be reinvested at net   \n       asset value per share on the           \n       respective payment dates of each       \n       distribution. Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized. Broker commission charges  \n       are not included in this calculation.  \n       If an                                  \n       affiliate had not made a contribution  \n  (f)  during the year

Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies The following is a summary of\nsignificant accounting policies followed by\nthe Trust in the preparation of its financial\nstatements: The preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d)\nrequires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts\nand disclosures in the financial statements.\nActual results could differ from those\nestimates. Each Fund is an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and\nreporting guidance applicable to investment\ncompanies. Security Valuation Each Fund's\ninvestments are valued at fair value each day\nthat the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) is\nopen and, for financial reporting purposes, as\nof the report date should the reporting period\nend on a day that the NYSE is not open. Fair\nvalue is generally defined as the price a fund\nwould receive to sell an asset or pay to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. By its nature, a fair value price is a\ngood faith estimate of the valuation in a\ncurrent sale and may not reflect an actual\nmarket price. The investments of each Fund are\nvalued pursuant to the policy and procedures\ndeveloped by the Oversight Committee (the\n\u201cCommittee\u201d) and approved by the Board. The\nCommittee provides oversight of the valuation\nof investments for the Funds. The Board has\nresponsibility for overseeing the\ndetermination of the fair value of\ninvestments. Valuation techniques used to\nvalue each Fund\u2019s investments by major\ncategory are as follows: \u2022 Investments in\nregistered investment companies (including\nmoney market funds) or other unitized pooled\ninvestment vehicles that are not traded on an\nexchange are valued at that day\u2019s published\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share or unit. \u2022\nGovernment and municipal fixed income\nsecurities are generally valued using\nquotations from independent pricing services\nor brokers. Certain government inflation-\nindexed securities may require a calculated\nfair valuation as the cumulative inflation is\ncontained within the price provided by the\npricing service or broker. For these\nsecurities, the inflation component of the\nprice is \u201ccleaned\u201d from the pricing service or\nbroker price utilizing the published inflation\nfactors in order to ensure proper accrual of\nincome. \u2022 Debt obligations (including short-\nterm investments and convertible debt\nsecurities) are valued using quotations from\nindependent pricing services or brokers or are\ngenerally valued at the last reported\nevaluated prices. \u2022 Forward foreign currency\nexchange contracts are valued based on that\nday\u2019s prevailing forward exchange rate for the\nunderlying currencies. The rates are obtained\nfrom independent pricing services in\naccordance with the valuation policy and\nprocedures approved by the Board.\n\n87\nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \n  SPDR SERIES                                 \n  TRUST                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(continued)    \n                                              \n                                              \n  December 31, 2022                           \n                                              \nIn the event prices or quotations are not     \nreadily available or                          \nthat the application of these valuation       \nmethods results in a price for an investment  \nthat is deemed to be not representative of the\nfair value of such investment, fair value will\nbe determined in good faith by the Committee, \nin accordance with the                        \nvaluation policy and procedures approved by   \nthe Board.                                    \n                                              \nVarious inputs are used in determining the    \nvalue of the Funds'                           \ninvestments.                                  \n                                              \nThe Funds value their assets and              \nliabilities at fair value using a fair value  \nhierarchy consisting of three broad levels    \nthat prioritize the inputs to valuation       \ntechniques giving the highest priority to     \nreadily available unadjusted quoted prices in \nactive markets for identical                  \nassets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)  \nand the lowest priority to unobservable inputs\n(Level 3 measurements) when market prices are \nnot readily available or reliable.

Derivative Financial Instruments\nForward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts\nCertain Funds may engage in forward foreign\ncurrency contracts to acquire exposure to\nforeign currencies or to hedge the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments against currency fluctuations. A\nforward foreign currency exchange contract is\na commitment to purchase or sell a foreign\ncurrency at the settlement date at a\nnegotiated rate. Non-deliverable forward\nforeign currency exchange contracts are\nsettled with the counterparty in cash without\nthe delivery of foreign currency. The contract\nis marked-to-market daily and the change in\nmarket value is recorded by the Fund as an\nunrealized gain or loss. When the contract is\nclosed, a Fund recognizes a realized gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the value\nof the contract at the time it was opened and\nthe value at the time it was closed. Certain\nrisks may arise upon entering into forward\nforeign currency exchange contracts from the\npotential inability of counterparties to meet\nthe terms of their contracts and are generally\nlimited to the amount of unrealized gains on\nappreciated contracts, if any. Additionally,\nwhen utilizing forward foreign currency\nexchange contracts to hedge, the Funds give up\nthe opportunity to profit from favorable\nexchange rate movements during the term of the\ncontract. For the fiscal year ended December\n31, 2022, the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets\nLocal Bond ETF entered into forward foreign\ncurrency exchange contracts to manage currency\nexposure.

Shareholder Transactions Each Fund issues\nand redeems its shares, at NAV, by each Fund\nonly in aggregations of a specified number of\nshares or multiples thereof (\u201cCreation\nUnits\u201d). Except when aggregated in Creation\nUnits, shares of each Fund are not redeemable.\nTransactions in capital shares for each Fund\nare disclosed in detail in the Statements of\nChanges in Net Assets. The consideration for\nthe purchase of Creation Units of a Fund may\nconsist of the in-kind deposit of a designated\nportfolio of securities and a specified amount\nof cash. Investors purchasing and redeeming\nCreation Units may pay a purchase transaction\nfee and a redemption transaction fee directly\nto the Trust and/or custodian, to offset\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance and redemption of\nCreation Units, including Creation Units for\ncash. An additional variable fee may be\ncharged for certain transactions. Such\nvariable charges, if any, are included in\n\u201cOther Capital\u201d on the Statements of Changes\nin Net Assets.\n\n92\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST NOTES TO\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) December 31,\n2022\n\n8. Income Tax Information The Funds have\nqualified and intend to continue to qualify as\nregulated investment companies under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code.\nEach Fund will not be subject to federal\nincome taxes to the extent it distributes its\ntaxable income, including any net realized\ncapital gains, for each fiscal year.\nTherefore, no provision for federal income tax\nis required. The Funds file federal and\nvarious state and local tax returns as\nrequired. No income tax returns are currently\nunder examination. Generally, the federal\nreturns are subject to examination by the\nInternal Revenue Service for a period of three\nyears from date of filing, while the state\nreturns may remain open for an additional year\ndepending upon jurisdiction. SSGA FM has\nanalyzed each Fund's tax positions taken on\ntax returns for all open years and does not\nbelieve there are any uncertain tax positions\nthat would require recognition of a tax\nliability. Distributions to shareholders are\nrecorded on ex-dividend date. Income dividends\nand gain distributions are determined in\naccordance with income tax rules and\nregulations, which may differ from generally\naccepted accounting principles. Certain\ncapital accounts in the financial statements\nhave been adjusted for permanent book-tax\ndifferences. These adjustments have no impact\non NAV or results of operations. Temporary\nbook-tax differences will reverse in the\nfuture. These book-tax differences are\nprimarily due to differing treatments for\ncharacter of distributions, in-kind\ntransactions, foreign currencies, premium\namortization, net operating losses, wash sale\nloss deferrals, TIPS adjustments, forward\ncontracts and distributions in excess of\ncurrent earnings. The tax character of\ndistributions paid during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, was as follows:\n                                              \n                   Long-\u2026       Tax

Securities Lending Each Fund may lend\nsecurities to qualified broker-dealers or\ninstitutional investors. The loans are secured\nat all times by cash, cash equivalents or U.S.\ngovernment securities in an amount at least\nequal to the market value of the securities\nloaned, plus accrued interest and dividends,\ndetermined on a daily basis and adjusted\naccordingly. The value of the collateral with\nrespect to a loaned security may be\ntemporarily more or less than the value of a\nsecurity due to market fluctuations of\nsecurities values. With respect to each loan,\nif on any U.S. business day the aggregate\nmarket value of securities collateral plus\ncash collateral is less than the aggregate\nmarket value of the securities which are\nsubject to the loan, the borrower will be\nnotified to provide additional collateral on\nthe next business day. The Funds will regain\nrecord ownership of loaned securities to\nexercise certain beneficial rights; however,\nthe Funds may bear the risk of delay in\nrecovery of, or even loss of rights in the\nsecurities loaned should the borrower fail\nfinancially. In addition, a Fund will bear the\nrisk of loss of any cash collateral that it\nmay invest. Each Fund receives compensation\nfor lending its securities from interest or\ndividends earned on the cash, cash equivalents\nor U.S. government securities held as\ncollateral, net of fee rebates paid to the\nborrower and net of fees paid to State Street\nas the lending agent. Additionally, a Fund\nwill receive a fee from the borrower for non-\ncash collateral equal to a percentage of the\nmarket value of the loaned securities. The\nmarket value of securities on loan as of\nDecember 31, 2022, and the value of the\ninvested cash collateral are disclosed in the\nFunds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nNon-cash collateral is not disclosed in the\nFunds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities as\nit is held by the lending agent on behalf of\nthe Funds and the Funds do not have the\nability to re-hypothecate those securities.\nSecurities lending income, as disclosed in the\nFunds' Statements of Operations, represents\nthe income earned from the non-cash collateral\nand the investment of cash collateral, net of\nfee rebates paid to the borrower and net of\nfees paid to State Street as lending agent.\nThe following is a summary of each Fund's\nsecurities lending agreements and related cash\nand non-cash collateral received as of\nDecember 31, 2022:\n                                              \n               Market        Cash      Total  \n  Fund       Value of    Collate\u2026    Collat\u2026  \n             Securit\u2026    Received    Receiv\u2026  \n              on Loan                         \n  SPDR                                        \n  Bloomb\u2026                                     \n  Emergi\u2026           $           $          $  \n  Markets    35,830,\u2026    36,893,\u2026    36,893\u2026  \n  Local                                       \n  Bond                                        \n  ETF                                         \n  SPDR                                        \n  Bloomb\u2026                                     \n  Intern\u2026    8,535,6\u2026    8,734,9\u2026    8,734,\u2026  \n  Corpor\u2026                                     \n  Bond                                        \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \n94\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST NOTES TO\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) December 31,\n2022\n                                              \n                 R\u2026                           \n                 C\u2026                           \n                 M\u2026                           \n                 of                           \n                 t\u2026                           \n                 A\u2026                           \n                 as                           \n                 of                           \n                 D\u2026                           \n                 3\u2026                           \n                 2\u2026                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                          B\u2026               \u2026  \n       S\u2026    O\u2026      \u2026    30    \u2026    T\u2026    \u2026  \n  \u2026    L\u2026    a\u2026      \u2026    &     \u2026    B\u2026    \u2026  \n       T\u2026    C\u2026           90               \u2026  \n                          D\u2026               \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    F\u2026                                     \n  \u2026    G\u2026    $\u2026      \u2026    $\u2014    \u2026    $\u2026    \u2026  \n  \u2026    O\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    C\u2026                                     \n  \u2026    B\u2026    8\u2026      \u2014    \u2014     \u2014    8\u2026    \u2026  \n  \u2026    &                                      \n  \u2026    N\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n10. Line of Credit The Funds and other\naffiliated funds (each, a \u201cParticipant\u201d and\ncollectively, the \u201cParticipants\u201d) have access\nto $200 million of a $1.275 billion ($1.1\nbillion prior to October 6, 2022) revolving\ncredit facility, provided by a syndication of\nbanks under which the Participants may borrow\nto fund shareholder redemptions. This\nagreement expires in October 2023 unless\nextended or renewed. The Participants are\ncharged an annual commitment fee which is\ncalculated based on the unused portion of the\nshared credit line. Commitment fees are\nallocated among each of the Participants based\non relative net assets. Commitment fees are\nordinary fund operating expenses paid by the\nAdviser. A participant incurs and pays the\ninterest expense related to its borrowing.\nInterest is calculated at a rate per annum\nequal to the sum of 1.00% plus the greater of\nthe New York Fed Bank Rate. The Fund had no\noutstanding loans as of December 31, 2022. 11.\nRisks Concentration Risk As a result of the\nFunds\u2019 ability to invest a large percentage of\ntheir assets in obligations of issuers within\nthe same country, state, region, currency or\neconomic sector, an adverse economic, business\nor political development may affect the value\nof the Funds\u2019 investments more than if the\nFunds were more broadly diversified. Foreign\nand Emerging Markets Risk Investing in foreign\nmarkets involves risks and considerations not\ntypically associated with investing in the\nU.S. Foreign securities may be subject to risk\nof loss because of government regulation,\neconomic, political and social instability in\nthe countries in which the Funds' invest.\nForeign markets may be less liquid than\ninvestments in the U.S. and may be subject to\nthe risks of currency fluctuations. To the\nextent that a Fund invests in securities of\nissuers located in emerging markets, these\nrisks may be even more pronounced. Credit Risk\nA Fund may be exposed to credit risk in the\nevent that an issuer or guarantor fails to\nperform or that an institution or entity with\nwhich the Fund has unsettled or open\ntransactions defaults. Market Risk Market\nprices of investments held by a Fund will go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. A Fund\u2019s investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile,\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\ninflation, changes in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in a\nFund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the\nFund invests do not perform well or are\nadversely affected by events. Further, legal,\npolitical, regulatory and tax changes also may\ncause fluctuations in markets and securities\nprices. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism,\nnatural disasters, the spread of infectious\nillness, such as COVID-19, or other public\nhealth issues, or other events could have a\n\n95\nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \n  SPDR SERIES                                 \n  TRUST                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(continued)    \n                                              \n                                              \n  December 31, 2022                           \n                                              \nsignificant impact on a Fund and its          \ninvestments.                                  \n                                              \n  Russian Sanctions Risk                      \n                                              \nSanctions threatened or imposed by a number of\njurisdictions,                                \nincluding the United States, the European     \nUnion and the United Kingdom, and other       \nintergovernmental actions that have been or   \nmay be undertaken in the future, against      \nRussia, Russian entities or Russian           \nindividuals, may result in the devaluation of \nRussian currency, a downgrade in the country\u2019s\ncredit rating, an immediate freeze of Russian \nassets, a decline in the value and liquidity  \nof Russian securities, property or interests, \nand/or other adverse consequences to the      \nRussian economy or                            \na Fund. The scope and scale of sanctions in   \nplace at a particular time may be expanded or \notherwise modified in a way that have negative\neffects on a Fund. Sanctions, or the threat of\nnew or modified sanctions, could impairthe    \nability of a Fund to                          \nbuy, sell, hold, receive, deliver or otherwise\ntransact in certain affected securities or    \nother investment instruments. Sanctions could \nalso result in Russia taking counter measures \nor other actions in response, which may       \nfurther impair the value                      \nand liquidity of Russian securities. These    \nsanctions, and the resulting disruption of the\nRussian economy, may cause volatility in other\nregional and global markets and may negatively\nimpact the performance of various sectors and \nindustries, as well                           \nas companies in other countries, which could  \nhave a negative effect on the performance of a\nFund, even if a Fund does not have direct     \nexposure to securities of Russian issuers. As \na collective result of the imposition of      \nsanctions, Russian                            \ngovernment countermeasures and the impact that\nthey have had on the trading markets for      \nRussian securities, certain Funds have used,  \nand may in the future use, fair valuation     \nprocedures approved by the Fund\u2019s Board to    \nvalue certain Russian                         \nsecurities, which could result in such        \nsecurities being deemed to have a zero value. \nA reduction in liquidity of certain Fund      \nholdings as a result of sanctions and related \nactions may cause a Fund to experience        \nincreased premiums or discounts to its        \nNAV and/or wider bid-ask spreads.             \nAdditionally, if it becomes impracticable or  \nunlawful for a Fund to hold securities subject\nto, or otherwise affected by, sanctions, or if\ndeemed appropriate by the Fund\u2019s investment   \nadviser, the Fund may                         \nprohibit in-kind deposits of the affected     \nsecurities in connection with creation        \ntransactions and instead require a cash       \ndeposit, which may also increase the Fund\u2019s   \ntransaction costs.                            \n                                              \n  12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recent Accounting Pronouncement      \n                                              \nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting       \nStandards Board                               \n(\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update   \nNo. 2020-04 (\u201cASU 2020-04\u201d), \u201cReference Rate  \nReform (Topic 848)\u201d. In response to concerns  \nabout structural risks of interbank offered   \nrates, and particularly the risk of           \ncessation of LIBOR, regulators have undertaken\nreference rate reform initiatives to identify \nalternative reference rates that are more     \nobservable or transaction based and less      \nsusceptible to manipulation. ASU 2020-04      \nprovides optional guidance for a              \nlimited period of time to ease the potential  \nburden in accounting for (or recognizing the  \neffects of) reference rate reform on financial\nreporting. ASU 2020-04 is elective and applies\nto all entities, subject to meeting certain   \ncriteria, that have                           \ncontracts, hedging relationships, and other   \ntransactions that reference LIBOR or another  \nreference rate expected to be discontinued    \nbecause of reference rate reform. The relief  \nprovided is temporary and generally cannot be \napplied to contract                           \nmodifications that occur after December 31,   \n2022, or hedging relationships entered into or\nevaluated after that date. However, the FASB  \nhas indicated that it will revisit the sunset \ndate in Topic 848 after the LIBOR             \nadministrator makes a final                   \ndecision on a phaseout date.

We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Trust in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB. We conducted our audits in\naccordance with the standards of the PCAOB.\nThose standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. The Trust is\nnot required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of the Trust\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. As part of\nour audits we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, but not for the purpose\nof expressing an opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Trust\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting.

This example is intended\nto help you understand your ongoing costs (in\ndollars) of investing in the Fund and to\ncompare these costs with the ongoing costs of\ninvesting in other mutual funds. It is based\non an investment of $1,000 made at the\nbeginning of the period shown and held for the\nentire period from July 1, 2022 to December\n31, 2022. The table below illustrates your\nFund\u2019s cost in two ways: Based on actual fund\nreturn \u2014\u2014This section helps you to estimate\nthe actual expenses that you paid over the\nperiod. The \u201cEnding Account Value\u201d shown is\nderived from each Fund's actual return, and\nthe third column shows the dollar amount that\nwould have been paid by an investor who\nstarted with $1,000 in each Fund. You may use\nthe information here, together with the amount\nyou invested, to estimate the expenses that\nyou paid over the period. To do so, simply\ndivide your account value by $1,000 (for\nexample, an $8,600 account value divided by\n$1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the\nnumber given for the Fund under the heading\n\u201cExpenses Paid During Period\u201d. Based on\nhypothetical 5% return \u2014\u2014This section is\nintended to help you compare your Fund\u2019s costs\nwith those of other mutual funds. It assumes\nthat the Fund had a yearly return of 5% before\nexpenses, but that the expense ratio is\nunchanged. In this case, because the return\nused is not the Fund\u2019s actual return, the\nresults do not apply to your investment. The\nexample is useful in making comparisons\nbecause the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) requires all mutual\nfunds to calculate expenses based on a 5%\nreturn. You can assess your Fund\u2019s costs by\ncomparing this hypothetical example with the\nhypothetical examples that appear in\nshareholder reports of other funds. Please\nnote that the expenses shown in the table are\nmeant to highlight your ongoing costs only and\ndo not reflect any transaction costs, such as\nsales load charges (loads).
