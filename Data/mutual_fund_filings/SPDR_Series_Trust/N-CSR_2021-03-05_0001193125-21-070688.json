A Fund\u2019s per\nshare NAV is\nthe value of one share of a Fund and is\ncalculated by dividing the value of total\nassets less total liabilities by the number of\nshares outstanding. The NAV return is based on\nthe NAV of a Fund and the market return is\nbased on the market price per\nshare of a Fund. The market price used to\ncalculate the market return is determined by\nusing the midpoint between the highest bid and\nthe lowest offer on the exchange on which the\nshares of a Fund are listed for trading, as of\nthe time that a\nFund\u2019s NAV is calculated. NAV and market\nreturns assume that dividends and capital gain\ndistributions have been reinvested in a Fund\nat NAV. Market returns do not include\nbrokerage commissions that may be payable on\nsecondary market\ntransactions. If brokerage commissions were\nincluded market returns would be lower.\n\nAn index is a statistical measure of a\nspecified financial\nmarket or sector. An index does not actually\nhold a portfolio of securities and therefore\ndoes not reflect deductions for fees or\nexpenses. In comparison, a Fund\u2019s performance\nis negatively impacted by these deductions.\nIndex returns reflect\nall items of income, gain and loss and the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\n\nThe Bloomberg Barclays EM Local Currency\nGovernment\nDiversified Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of the fixed-rate local currency\nsovereign debt of emerging market countries.\nThe Index includes government bonds issued by\ninvestment grade and non-investment grade\ncountries outside the\nUnited States, in local currencies, that have\na remaining maturity of one year or more and\nare rated B3/B-/B- or higher using the middle\nrating of Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc.,\nStandard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services, LLC and\nFitch\nInc., respectively.\n\nThe Bloomberg Barclays Global\nAggregate ex-USD >$1B: Corporate Bond Index is\ndesigned to be a broad based measure of the\nglobal investment-grade, fixed rate, fixed\nincome corporate markets outside the United\nStates. The Index is part of the Bloomberg\nBarclays Global ex-USD\nAggregate Bond Index (the \u201cAggregate Index\u201d).\nThe major components of the Aggregate Index\nare the Pan-European Aggregate and the Asian\nPacific Aggregate Indices. The securities in\nthe Index must have a $1 billion USD\nequivalent market\ncapitalization outstanding and at least 1 year\nremaining. Securities must be fixed rate,\nalthough zero coupon bonds and step-ups are\npermitted. Additionally, securities must be\nrated investmen grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or\nbetter) using the middle rating\nfrom Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch\nInc.,or Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services,\nLLC. after dropping the highest and lowest\navailable ratings. If only two agencies rate a\nsecurity, then the more conservative (lower)\nrating\nwill be used. If only one rating agency rates\na security, then that one rating will be used.\nExcluded from the Index are subordinated\ndebts, convertible securities, floating-rate\nnotes, fixed-rate perpetuals, warrants,\ninflation-linked bonds, and\nstructured notes. The Index is market\ncapitalization weighted and the securities in\nthe Index are updated on the last business day\nof each month.\n\nThe Bloomberg Barclays Global Treasury ex-US\nCapped Index\nis designed to track the fixed-rate local\ncurrency sovereign debt of investment grade\ncountries outside the United States. The Index\nincludes government bonds issued by investment\ngrade countries outside the United States, in\nlocal currencies, that\nhave a remaining maturity of one year or more\nand are rated investment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB-\nor higher using the middle rating of Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor\u2019s,\nInc. and Fitch Inc., respectively). The Index\nis\ncalculated by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\nusing a modified \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d\nmethodology. This design ensures that each\nconstituent country within the Index is\nrepresented in a proportion consistent with\nits percentage with\nrespect to the total market capitalization of\nthe Index. The index is rebalanced on a\nmonthly basis.\n\nThe Bloomberg Barclays 1-3 Year Global\nTreasury ex-US\nCapped index is designed to measure the\nperformance of fixed-rate local currency\nsovereign debt of investment grade countries\noutside the United States that have remaining\nmaturities of one to three years. The Index\nincludes government bonds issued\nby investment grade countries outside the\nUnited States, in local currencies, that have\nremaining maturities of one to three years and\nare rated investment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or\nhigher using the middle rating of Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service,\nInc., Standard & Poor\u2019s, Inc. and Fitch Inc.,\nrespectively). The securities in the Index\nmust be fixed-rate and have certain minimum\namounts outstanding, depending upon the\ncurrency in which the bonds are denominated.\nThe Index is\ncalculated by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\nusing a modified \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d\nmethodology. This design ensures that each\nconstituent country within the Index is\nrepresented in a proportion consistent with\nits percentage with\nrespect to the total market capitalization of\nthe Index. Component securities in each\nconstituent country are represented in a\nproportion consistent with their percentage\nrelative to the other component securities in\nthe constituent country. The\nsecurities in the Index are updated monthly,\non the last business day of each month.\n\nThe FTSE International Inflation-Linked\nSecurities Select\nIndex is designed to measure the total return\nperformance of inflation-linked bonds outside\nthe United States with fixed-rate coupon\npayments that are linked to an inflation\nindex. Inflation-protected public obligations\nof the inflation-linked\ngovernment bond markets of developed and\nemerging market countries, commonly known in\nthe United States as TIPS, are securities\nissued by such governments that are designed\nto provide inflation protection to investors.\nThe Index includes government\ndebt (direct obligations of the issuer\ncountry) but does not include quasi-government\ndebt or corporate debt.\nSee accompanying notes to financial           \nstatements.                                   \n                      1                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                     SPDR                     \nBloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets Local Bond\n                     ETF                      \n                                              \n       Management                             \n       Discussion Of Fund Performance         \n       (Unaudited)                            \n                                              \nThe SPDR\nBloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets Local Bond\nETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment\nresults that, before fees and expenses,\ncorrespond generally to the price and yield\nperformance of an index that tracks the fixed-\nrate local\ncurrency sovereign debt of emerging market\n(EM) countries. The Fund\u2019s benchmark is the\nBloomberg Barclays EM Local Currency\nGovernment Diversified Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d).\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December 31,\n2020 (the\n\u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total return for the\nFund was 4.59%, and the Index was 5.13%. The\nFund and Index returns reflect the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing the\nFund, including brokerage and advisory\nexpenses. The Index is unmanaged and Index\nreturns do not reflect fees and expenses of\nany kind, which would have a negative impact\non returns. Fees, expenses, cash drag, tax\nwithholdings, and pricing\nvolatility due to COVID-19 contributed to the\ndifference between the Fund\u2019s performance and\nthat of the Index.\n\nPolicy action, the exogenous shock of\nCOVID-19, and\ninvestor risk-off sentiment beginning in Q1\n2020 were the primary drivers of Fund\nperformance during the Reporting Period. The\nFund maintained a consistent average NAV\naround $27.52 until the onset of the COVID-19\npandemic in the United States,\nwhich saw the Fund\u2019s NAV fall to $23.33 in\nMarch 2020 before recovering to $28.05 by the\nend of the year.\n\nIn Q1 2020, COVID-19 created volatility and\nuncertainty in\nthe markets as the global economic outlook\nshifted from the modest above-trend growth\nanticipated at the beginning of the Calendar\nYear to severe economic recession. As a\nriskier segment of the fixed income market, EM\nwas negatively impacted in Q1\n2020 as investor risk-off sentiment prompted\nsignificant outflows, spreads in the sector\nrose to historical wides, and the virus\nheightened the risk of EM defaults.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s performance recovery started in Q2\n2020\nand extended throughout the year on the back\nof substantial worldwide fiscal and monetary\npolicy support with many central banks cutting\nrates to near zero percent and implied policy\nrates suggesting few, if any, rate hikes in\nthe coming years. The\nsharp rebound in EM aided performance with\ncurrency valuations offering historically\nattractive entry points and strong issuer\nfundamentals favoring local currency debt.\nThe Fund entered into forward currency        \nexchange contracts for                        \nhedging purposes to help reduce the risks and \nvolatility caused by changes in foreign       \ncurrency exchange rates and to gain exposure  \nto certain currencies which helped the Fund   \ntrack the Index.                              \nThe views expressed above reflect those of the\nFund\u2019s\nportfolio manager only through the Reporting\nPeriod, and do not necessarily represent the\nviews of the Adviser as a whole. Any such\nviews are subject to change at any time based\nupon market or other conditions and the\nAdviser disclaims any\nresponsibility to update such views. These\nviews may not be relied on as investment\nadvice and, because investment decisions for a\nfund are based on numerous factors, may not be\nrelied on as an indication of trading intent\non behalf of any fund.\nSee                                           \naccompanying notes to financial statements.   \n                      2                       \nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets Local\nBond ETF Performance Summary (Unaudited)\nPerformance as of December 31, 2020\n                                              \n             Cum\u2026                Aver\u2026        \n             Tot\u2026                Annu\u2026        \n             Ret\u2026                Total        \n                                 Retu\u2026        \n                   Blo\u2026                 Blo\u2026  \n                   Bar\u2026                 Bar\u2026  \n        Net          EM     Net           EM  \n       Ass\u2026  Mar\u2026  Loc\u2026    Ass\u2026  Mark\u2026  Loc\u2026  \n       Val\u2026  Val\u2026  Cur\u2026    Val\u2026  Value  Cur\u2026  \n                   Gov\u2026                 Gov\u2026  \n                   Div\u2026                 Div\u2026  \n                   Ind\u2026                 Ind\u2026  \n  ONE  4.59  4.55  5.13    4.59   4.55  5.13  \n  YE\u2026                                         \n  FI\u2026  31.\u2026  32.\u2026  36.\u2026    5.59   5.79  6.35  \n  YE\u2026                                         \n  SI\u2026  19.\u2026  19.\u2026  29.\u2026    1.83   1.86  2.67  \n  IN\u2026                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       For                                    \n       the period February 23, 2011 to        \n       December 31, 2020.

The Fund\u2019s\nbenchmark is the Bloomberg Barclays Global\nAggregate ex-USD >$1B: Corporate Bond Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d).\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December 31,\n2020 (the\n\u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total return for the\nFund was 11.69%, and the Index was 12.31%. The\nFund and Index returns reflect the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing\nthe Fund, including brokerage and advisory\nexpenses. The Index is unmanaged and Index\nreturns do not reflect fees and expenses of\nany kind, which would have a negative impact\non returns. Fees and expenses, cash drag,\nmisweights, and pricing\nvolatility due to COVID-19 contributed to the\ndifference between the Fund\u2019s performance and\nthat of the Index.\n\nPolicy action, the exogenous shock of\nCOVID-19, and\ninvestor risk-off sentiment beginning in Q1\n2020 were the primary drivers of Fund\nperformance during the Reporting Period. The\nFund maintained a consistent average NAV\naround $33.73 until the onset of the COVID-19\npandemic in the United States,\nwhich saw the Fund\u2019s NAV fall to $28.93 in\nMarch 2020 before recovering to $37.90 by the\nend of the year end.\n\nCOVID-19 created volatility and uncertainty in\nthe markets\nas the global economic outlook shifted from\nthe modest above-trend growth anticipated at\nthe beginning of the Calendar Year to severe\neconomic recession. Fixed income spread\nsectors, including international corporates,\nwere negatively impacted as\ninvestor risk-off sentiment initially prompted\noutflows and volatility drove credit spreads\nto historical wides.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s performance recovery began in Q2\n2020 and\nextended to the remainder of the year as\nglobal corporates rebounded on the back of\nsubstantial fiscal and monetary policy\nsupport. Global corporates rallied across most\nsectors and all ratings as risk-on sentiment\ngrew amid optimism about a\nretreating virus and substantial and timely\nsupport from central banks. Spread tightening\nin corporate sectors was a continuous trend\npost-March and contributed to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance.\nThe Fund did not invest in derivatives during \nthe Reporting                                 \nPeriod.                                       \nOn an individual security level, the top\npositive contributors to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance during the Reporting Period were\nThe Wellcome Trust Ltd., Thermo Fisher\nScientific Inc. and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA.\nThe top negative contributors to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance during the\nReporting Period were ZF North America Capital\nInc., Ford Motor Credit Co. and General\nElectric Co.\n\nThe views expressed above reflect those of the\nFund\u2019s\nportfolio manager only through the Reporting\nPeriod, and do not necessarily represent the\nviews of the Adviser as a whole.

The\nFund\u2019s benchmark is the Bloomberg Barclays 1-3\nYear Global Treasury ex-US Capped Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d).\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December 31,\n2020 (the\n\u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total return for the\nFund was 6.49%, and the Index was 7.01%. The\nFund and Index returns reflect the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing the\nFund, including brokerage and advisory\nexpenses. The Index is unmanaged and Index\nreturns do not reflect fees and expenses of\nany kind, which would have a negative impact\non returns. Fees, expenses, cash drag, tax\nwithholdings, and pricing\nvolatility due to COVID-19 contributed to the\ndifference between the Fund\u2019s performance and\nthat of the Index.\n\nPolicy action and the exogenous shock of\nCOVID-19 were the\nprimary drivers of Fund performance during the\nReporting Period. In Q1 2020, the emergence of\nCOVID-19 created volatility and dislocation in\nthe markets with the global economic outlook\nshifting from modest above-trend growth in\nearly 2020 to severe\neconomic recession. In response, central banks\naround the world cut policy rates\nsubstantially, many to around zero percent.\nInternational Treasury securities sold off\nsharply at the height of the market\ndislocations in March, reaching a low of\n$28.64, as uncertainty about the virus created\nvolatility in even \u201csafe haven\u201d assets.\nHowever, performance recovered into Q2 2020 on\nthe back of timely and substantial monetary\nand fiscal policy responses worldwide. The\nfund continued\nto perform positively into year-end due to\ncontinued support by world governments and\nbanks with the Fund\u2019s NAV recovering to $32.82\nby the end of the year.\nThe Fund did not invest in derivatives during \nthe Reporting                                 \nPeriod.                                       \nOn an country specific level, the top\npositive contributors to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance during the Reporting Period were\nSwedish, Colombian, and Australian government\nbonds. The top negative contributors to the\nFund\u2019s performance during the Reporting Period\nwere Russian,\nLatvian, and Peruvian government bonds.\n\nThe views\nexpressed above reflect those of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio manager only through the Reporting\nPeriod, and do not necessarily represent the\nviews of the Adviser as a whole.

The Fund\u2019s benchmark is the\nFTSE International Inflation-Linked Securities\nSelect Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d).\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December 31,\n2020 (the\n\u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total return for the\nFund was 7.76%, and the Index was 8.71%. The\nFund and Index returns reflect the\nreinvestment of dividends and other income.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing the\nFund, including brokerage and advisory\nexpenses. The Index is unmanaged and Index\nreturns do not reflect fees and expenses of\nany kind, which would have a negative impact\non returns. Fees, expenses, tax withholdings,\nmisweights, and pricing\nvolatility due to COVID-19 contributed to the\ndifference between the Fund\u2019s performance and\nthat of the Index.\n\nPolicy action, the exogenous shock of\nCOVID-19, and\ninvestor risk-off sentiment in Q1 2020 were\nthe primary drivers of Fund performance during\nthe Reporting Period. In Q1 2020, COVID-19\ncreated volatility and dislocation in the\nmarkets with the global economic outlook\nshifting from modest above-trend\ngrowth in early 2020 to severe economic\nrecession. In response, central banks around\nthe world cut policy rates substantially, many\nto around zero percent. International\ninflation-linked securities sold off sharply\nat the height of the market\ndislocations in March, reaching a low of\n$44.88, as investors sought safety in nominal\ngovernment bonds versus inflation-linked\nsecurities. However, real yields subsequently\nrallied and longer-term inflation expectations\nrecovered somewhat given the\nstrong monetary and fiscal policy responses\nworldwide. The Fund\u2019s performance recovered\nstarting in Q2 and stretching to the end of\nthe year, while the Fund\u2019s NAV likewise\nrecovered $58.71 by the end of the Reporting\nPeriod.\nThe Fund did not invest in derivatives during \nthe Reporting                                 \nPeriod.                                       \nOn an country specific level, the top\npositive contributors to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance during the Reporting Period were\nTurkish, South African and Brazilian\ngovernment bonds. The top negative\ncontributors to the Fund\u2019s performance during\nthe Reporting Period were Colombian,\nMexican and South Korean government bonds.\n\nThe views\nexpressed above reflect those of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio manager only through the Reporting\nPeriod, and do not necessarily represent the\nviews of the Adviser as a whole. Any such\nviews are subject to change at any time based\nupon market or other\nconditions and the Adviser disclaims any\nresponsibility to update such views.

Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies The following is a summary\nof significant accounting policies followed by\nthe Trust in the preparation of its financial\nstatements: The preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d)\nrequires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts\nand disclosures in the financial statements.\nActual results could differ from those\nestimates. Each Fund is an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and\nreporting guidance applicable to investment\ncompanies. Security Valuation Each Fund's\ninvestments are valued at fair value each day\nthat the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) is\nopen and, for financial reporting purposes, as\nof the report date should the reporting period\nend on a day that the NYSE is not open. Fair\nvalue is generally defined as the price a fund\nwould receive to sell an asset or pay to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. By its nature, a fair value price is a\ngood faith estimate of the valuation in a\ncurrent sale and may not reflect an actual\nmarket price. The investments of each Fund are\nvalued pursuant to the policy and procedures\ndeveloped by the Oversight Committee (the\n\u201cCommittee\u201d) and approved by the Board. The\nCommittee provides oversight of the valuation\nof investments for the Funds. The Board has\nresponsibility for overseeing the\ndetermination of the fair value of\ninvestments. Valuation techniques used to\nvalue each Fund\u2019s investments by major\ncategory are as follows: \u2022 Investments in\nregistered investment companies (including\nmoney market funds) or other unitized pooled\ninvestment vehicles that are not traded on an\nexchange are valued at that day\u2019s published\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share or unit. \u2022\nGovernment and municipal fixed income\nsecurities are generally valued using\nquotations from independent pricing services\nor brokers.

Foreign currencies as well as\ninvestment securities and other assets and\nliabilities denominated in a foreign currency\nare translated to U.S. dollars using exchange\nrates at period end. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities, income receipts and expense\npayments denominated in foreign currencies are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing\nexchange rate on the respective dates of the\ntransactions. The effects of exchange rate\nfluctuations on investments are included with\nthe net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on\ninvestment securities. Other foreign currency\ntransactions resulting in realized and\nunrealized gain (loss) are disclosed\nseparately. Foreign Taxes The Funds may be\nsubject to foreign taxes (a portion of which\nmay be reclaimable) on income, stock\ndividends, realized and unrealized capital\ngains on investments or certain foreign\ncurrency transactions. Foreign taxes are\nrecorded in accordance with SSGA FM\nunderstanding of the applicable foreign tax\nregulations and rates that exist in the\nforeign jurisdictions in which the Funds\ninvest. These foreign taxes, if any, are paid\nby the Funds and are reflected in the\nStatements of Operations, if applicable.\nForeign taxes payable or deferred as of\nDecember 31, 2020, if any, are disclosed in\nthe Funds' Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. Distributions Distributions from\nnet investment income, if any, are declared\nand paid monthly. Net realized capital gains,\nif any, are distributed annually. Dividends\nmay be declared and paid more frequently or at\nany other times to improve Index tracking or\nto comply with the distribution requirements\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d). The\namount and character of income and capital\ngains to be distributed are determined in\naccordance with applicable tax regulations\nwhich may differ from net investment income\nand realized gains recognized for U.S. GAAP\npurposes. 3. Derivative Financial Instruments\nForward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts\nCertain Funds may engage in forward foreign\ncurrency contracts to acquire exposure to\nforeign currencies or to hedge the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments against currency fluctuations. A\nforward foreign currency exchange contract is\na commitment to purchase or sell a foreign\ncurrency at the settlement date at a\nnegotiated rate. Non-deliverable forward\nforeign currency exchange contracts are\nsettled with the counterparty in cash without\nthe delivery of foreign currency. The contract\nis marked-to-market daily and the change in\nmarket value is recorded by the Fund as an\nunrealized gain or loss. When the contract is\nclosed, a Fund recognizes a realized gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the value\nof the contract at the time it was opened and\nthe value at the time it was closed. Certain\nrisks may arise upon entering into forward\nforeign currency exchange contracts from the\npotential inability of counterparties to meet\nthe terms of their contracts and are generally\nlimited to the amount of unrealized gains on\nappreciated contracts, if any. Additionally,\nwhen utilizing forward foreign currency\nexchange contracts to hedge, the Funds give up\nthe opportunity to profit from favorable\nexchange rate movements during the term of the\ncontract. For the year ended December 31,\n2020, the following Funds entered into forward\nforeign currency exchange contracts for the\nstrategies listed below:\n                                              \n

Shareholder Transactions Each Fund issues\nand redeems its shares, at NAV, by each Fund\nonly in aggregations of a specified number of\nshares or multiples thereof (\u201cCreation\nUnits\u201d). Except when aggregated in Creation\nUnits, shares of each Fund are not redeemable.\nTransactions in capital shares for each Fund\nare disclosed in detail in the Statements of\nChanges in Net Assets. The consideration for\nthe purchase of Creation Units of a Fund may\nconsist of the in-kind deposit of a designated\nportfolio of securities and a specified amount\nof cash . Investors purchasing and redeeming\nCreation Units may pay a purchase transaction\nfee and a redemption transaction fee directly\nto the Trust and/or custodian, to offset\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance and redemption of\nCreation Units, including Creation Units for\ncash. An additional variable fee may be\ncharged for certain transactions. Such\nvariable charges, if any, are included in\n\u201cOther Capital\u201d on the Statements of Changes\nin Net Assets. 8. Income Tax Information The\nFunds have qualified and intend to continue to\nqualify as regulated investment companies\nunder Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue\nCode. Each Fund will not be subject to federal\nincome taxes to the extent it distributes its\ntaxable income, including any net realized\ncapital gains, for each fiscal year.\nTherefore, no provision for federal income tax\nis required. The Funds file federal and\nvarious state and local tax returns as\nrequired. No income tax returns are currently\nunder examination. Generally, the federal\nreturns are subject to examination by the\nInternal Revenue Service for a period of three\nyears from date of filing, while the state\nreturns may remain open for an additional year\ndepending upon jurisdiction. SSGA FM has\nanalyzed each Fund's tax positions taken on\ntax returns for all open years and does not\nbelieve there are any uncertain tax positions\nthat would require recognition of a tax\nliability. Distributions to shareholders are\nrecorded on ex-dividend date. Income dividends\nand gain distributions are determined in\naccordance with income tax rules and\nregulations, which may differ from generally\naccepted accounting principles. Certain\ncapital accounts in the financial statements\nhave been adjusted for permanent book-tax\ndifferences. These adjustments have no impact\non NAV or results of operations. Temporary\nbook-tax differences will reverse in the\nfuture. These book-tax differences are\nprimarily due to differing treatments for\ncharacter of distributions, in-kind\ntransactions, foreign currencies, premium\namortization, net operating losses, wash sale\nloss deferrals, TIPS adjustments, forward\ncontracts and distributions in excess of\ncurrent earnings.\n\n91\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST NOTES TO\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Securities Lending Each Fund may lend\nsecurities to qualified broker-dealers or\ninstitutional investors. The loans are secured\nat all times by cash, cash equivalents or U.S.\ngovernment securities in an amount at least\nequal to the market value of the securities\nloaned, plus accrued interest and dividends,\ndetermined on a daily basis and adjusted\naccordingly. The value of the collateral with\nrespect to a loaned security may be\ntemporarily more or less than the value of a\nsecurity due to market fluctuations of\nsecurities values. With respect to each loan,\nif on any U.S. business day the aggregate\nmarket value of securities collateral plus\ncash collateral is less than the aggregate\nmarket value of the securities which are\nsubject to the loan, the borrower will be\nnotified to provide additional collateral on\nthe next business day. The Funds will regain\nrecord ownership of loaned securities to\nexercise certain beneficial rights; however,\nthe Funds may bear the risk of delay in\nrecovery of, or even loss of rights in the\nsecurities loaned should the borrower fail\nfinancially. In addition, a Fund will bear the\nrisk of loss of any cash collateral that it\nmay invest. Each Fund receives compensation\nfor lending its securities from interest or\ndividends earned on the cash, cash equivalents\nor U.S. government securities held as\ncollateral, net of fee rebates paid to the\nborrower and net of fees paid to State Street\nas the lending agent. Additionally, a Fund\nwill receive a fee from the borrower for non-\ncash collateral equal to a percentage of the\nmarket value of the loaned securities. The\nmarket value of securities on loan as of\nDecember 31, 2020, and the value of the\ninvested cash collateral are disclosed in the\nFunds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nNon-cash collateral is not disclosed in the\nFunds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities as\nit is held by the lending agent on behalf of\nthe Funds, and the Funds do not have the\nability to re-hypothecate those securities.\nSecurities lending income, as disclosed in the\nFunds' Statements of Operations, represents\nthe income earned from the non-cash collateral\nand the investment of cash collateral, net of\nfee rebates paid to the borrower and net of\nfees paid to State Street as lending agent.\nThe following is a summary of each Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agreements and related cash\nand non-cash collateral received as of\nDecember 31, 2020:\n                                              \n          Market                              \n           Value     Cash    Non-C\u2026    Total  \n  Fund        of    Coll\u2026    Colla\u2026    Coll\u2026  \n          Secur\u2026    Rece\u2026    Recei\u2026    Rece\u2026  \n              on                              \n            Loan                              \n  SPDR                                        \n  Blo\u2026                                        \n  Bar\u2026         $        $    $             $  \n  Int\u2026    587,7\u2026    597,\u2026    \u2014         597,\u2026  \n  Cor\u2026                                        \n  Bond                                        \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \n93\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST NOTES TO\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) December 31,\n2020\n                                              \n                 R\u2026                           \n                 C\u2026                           \n                 M\u2026                           \n                 of                           \n                 t\u2026                           \n                 A\u2026                           \n                 As                           \n                 of                           \n                 D\u2026                           \n                 3\u2026                           \n                 2\u2026                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                          B\u2026               \u2026  \n       S\u2026    O\u2026      \u2026    30    \u2026    T\u2026    \u2026  \n  \u2026    L\u2026    a\u2026      \u2026    &     \u2026    B\u2026    \u2026  \n       T\u2026    C\u2026           90               \u2026  \n                          D\u2026               \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    C\u2026                                     \n  \u2026    B\u2026                                     \n  \u2026    &     $\u2026      \u2026    $\u2014    \u2026    $\u2026    \u2026  \n  \u2026    N\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n10. Line of Credit The Funds and other\naffiliated funds (each, a \u201cParticipant\u201d and\ncollectively, the \u201cParticipants\u201d) have access\nto $200 million of a $500 million revolving\ncredit facility, provided by a syndication of\nbanks under which the Participants may borrow\nto fund shareholder redemptions. This\nagreement expires in October 2021 unless\nextended or renewed. The Participants are\ncharged an annual commitment fee which is\ncalculated based on the unused portion of the\nshared credit line. Commitment fees are\nallocated among each of the Participants based\non relative net assets. Commitment fees are\nordinary fund operating expenses. A\nparticipant incurs and pays the interest\nexpense related to its borrowing. Interest is\ncalculated at a rate per annum equal to the\nsum of 1.25% plus the New York Fed Bank Rate.\nPrior to October 8, 2020, interest was\ncalculated at a rate per annum equal to the\nsum of 1% plus the greater of the New York Fed\nBank Rate and 1-month LIBOR rate. The Funds\nhad no outstanding loans as of December 31,\n2020. 11. Risks Concentration Risk As a result\nof the Funds' ability to invest a large\npercentage of their assets in obligations of\nissuers within the same country, state,\nregion, currency or economic sector, an\nadverse economic, business or political\ndevelopment may affect the value of the Funds\u2019\ninvestments more than if the Funds were more\nbroadly diversified. Foreign and Emerging\nMarkets Risk Investing in foreign markets\ninvolves risks and considerations not\ntypically associated with investing in the\nU.S. Foreign securities may be subject to risk\nof loss because of government regulation,\neconomic, political and social instability in\nthe countries in which the Funds' invest.\nForeign markets may be less liquid than\ninvestments in the U.S. and may be subject to\nthe risks of currency fluctuations. To the\nextent that a Fund invests in securities of\nissuers located in emerging markets, these\nrisks may be even more pronounced. Credit Risk\nA Fund may be exposed to credit risk in the\nevent that an issuer or guarantor fails to\nperform or that an institution or entity with\nwhich the Fund has unsettled or open\ntransactions defaults. Market Risk Each Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are subject to changes in general\neconomic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in\ninvestment in securities markets. Investment\nmarkets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to,\neconomic growth or recession, changes in\ninterest rates, changes in the actual or\nperceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. Each Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will\ndisrupt securities markets and adversely\naffect global economies and markets.

Financial markets\nhave experienced extreme                      \nvolatility and severe losses, and trading in  \nmany instruments has been disrupted. Liquidity\nfor many instruments has been greatly reduced \nfor periods of time. Some interest rates are  \nvery low and in some cases yields are         \nnegative. Governments and                     \ncentral banks, including the Federal Reserve  \nin the United States, have taken extraordinary\nand unprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal economies and the financial markets.   \nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective                             \nto mitigate the economic and market           \ndisruption, will not be known for some time.  \nIn addition, the outbreak of COVID-19, and    \nmeasures taken to mitigate its effects, could \nresult in disruptions to the services provided\nto a Fund by its service                      \nproviders.                                    \n                                              \n  12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New Accounting                       \n  Pronouncement                               \n                                              \nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting       \nStandards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting    \nStandards Update No. 2020-04 (\u201cASU 2020-04\u201d), \n\u201cReference Rate Reform (Topic 848)\u201d. In       \nresponse to concerns about structural risks of\ninterbank offered rates, and                  \nparticularly the risk of cessation of LIBOR,  \nregulators have undertaken reference rate     \nreform initiatives to identify alternative    \nreference rates that are more observable or   \ntransaction based and less susceptible to     \nmanipulation. ASU 2020-04                     \nprovides optional guidance for a limited      \nperiod of time to ease the potential burden in\naccounting for (or recognizing the effects of)\nreference rate reform on financial reporting. \nASU 2020-04 is elective and applies to all    \nentities, subject to                          \nmeeting certain criteria, that have contracts,\nhedging relationships, and other transactions \nthat reference LIBOR or another reference rate\nexpected to be discontinued because of        \nreference rate reform.

Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our\nprocedures included confirmation of securities\nowned as of December 31, 2020, by\ncorrespondence with the custodian, brokers and\nothers or by other appropriate auditing\nprocedures where replies from brokers and\nothers were not received. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles\nused and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial\n\n96\nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \n  SPDR SERIES                                 \n  TRUST                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC     \n                                              \n                                              \n  ACCOUNTING FIRM                             \n                                              \nstatements.

This example is intended\nto help you understand your ongoing costs (in\ndollars) of investing in the Fund and to\ncompare these costs with the ongoing costs of\ninvesting in other mutual funds. It is based\non an investment of $1,000 made at the\nbeginning of the period shown and held for the\nentire period from July 1, 2020 to December\n31, 2020. The table below illustrates your\nFund\u2019s cost in two ways: Based on actual fund\nreturn \u2014\u2014This section helps you to estimate\nthe actual expenses that you paid over the\nperiod. The \u201cEnding Account Value\u201d shown is\nderived from each Fund's actual return, and\nthe third column shows the dollar amount that\nwould have been paid by an investor who\nstarted with $1,000 in each Fund. You may use\nthe information here, together with the amount\nyou invested, to estimate the expenses that\nyou paid over the period. To do so, simply\ndivide your account value by $1,000 (for\nexample, an $8,600 account value divided by\n$1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the\nnumber given for the Fund under the heading\n\u201cExpenses Paid During Period\u201d. Based on\nhypothetical 5% return \u2014\u2014This section is\nintended to help you compare your Fund\u2019s costs\nwith those of other mutual funds. It assumes\nthat the Fund had a yearly return of 5% before\nexpenses, but that the expense ratio is\nunchanged. In this case, because the return\nused is not the Fund\u2019s actual return, the\nresults do not apply to your investment. The\nexample is useful in making comparisons\nbecause the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) requires all mutual\nfunds to calculate expenses based on a 5%\nreturn. You can assess your Fund\u2019s costs by\ncomparing this hypothetical example with the\nhypothetical examples that appear in\nshareholder reports of other funds. Please\nnote that the expenses shown in the table are\nmeant to highlight your ongoing costs only and\ndo not reflect any transaction costs, such as\nsales load charges (loads). Therefore, the\nhypothetical 5% return section of the table is\nuseful in comparing ongoing costs only, and\nwill not help you determine the relative total\ncosts of owning different funds. In addition,\nif these transaction costs were included, your\ncosts would have been higher.\n                                              \n                                   Hyp\u2026       \n                                   (as\u2026       \n                  Ac\u2026              a 5%       \n                                   ret\u2026       \n                                   bef\u2026       \n                                   exp\u2026       \n      An\u2026    En\u2026       Ex\u2026    En\u2026        Ex\u2026  \n      Ex\u2026    Ac\u2026       Pa\u2026    Ac\u2026        Pa\u2026  \n      Ra\u2026    Va\u2026       Du\u2026    Va\u2026        Du\u2026  \n                       Pe\u2026               Pe\u2026  \n  S\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026  0.\u2026    $1\u2026       $1\u2026    $1\u2026        $1\u2026  \n  M\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026  0.\u2026    1,\u2026       2.\u2026    1,\u2026        2.\u2026  \n  C\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026  0.\u2026    1,\u2026       1.\u2026    1,\u2026        1.\u2026  \n  T\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026  0.\u2026    1,\u2026       1.\u2026    1,\u2026        1.\u2026  \n  I\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026                                          \n  G\u2026  0.\u2026    1,\u2026       2.\u2026    1,\u2026        2.\u2026  \n  I\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Expenses are equal to the              \n       Fund's annualized net expense ratio    \n  (a)  multiplied by the average account      \n       value of the period, multiplied by     \n       184, then divided by 366.              \n                                              \n98\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST OTHER\nINFORMATION (continued) December 31, 2020\n(Unaudited)\n\nTax Information For federal income tax\npurposes, the following information is\nfurnished with respect to the distributions of\nthe Trust for its fiscal year ended December\n31, 2020.
