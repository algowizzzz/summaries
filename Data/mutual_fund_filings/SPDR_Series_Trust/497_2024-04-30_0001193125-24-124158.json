Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and return characteristics of the Index. The quantity\nof holdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may invest the Fund\u2019s assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest the\nFund\u2019s assets in substantially all of the securities represented in the Index in approximately the same\nproportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all, but at least\n80%, of its total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in equity securities that are not included in the Index, cash and cash equivalents or\nmoney market instruments, such as repurchase agreements and money market funds (including money market funds\nadvised by the Adviser). In seeking to track the Index, the Fund\u2019s assets may be concentrated in an industry\nor group of industries, but only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a particular industry or group\nof industries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of securities meeting certain sustainability criteria (criteria related to ESG factors), while\nmaintaining similar overall industry group weights as the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. The S&P SmallCap 600 Index\nmeasures the performance of the small-capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. Securities eligible\nfor inclusion in the Index comprise all constituents of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index except for:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022    Companies that meet any of the following Business Involvement Exclusions, based on revenue levels    \n       as determined by S&P Global, Inc.

After implementing the exclusion criteria\ndescribed above, the remaining companies are then ranked based on their S&P Global ESG Score. For each GICS\nindustry group, companies are selected for inclusion in the Index primarily in decreasing order of S&P\nGlobal ESG Score until approximately 75% of the float adjusted market capitalization of the industry group\nis reached. The Index is float-adjusted market capitalization weighted. A company\u2019s float-adjusted market\ncapitalization is calculated by multiplying the number of shares readily available in the market by the\nprice of such shares. The Index is reconstituted and rebalanced annually on the last business day in April\nbased on information as of the last trading date in March. In addition, companies will be removed from the\nIndex (i) on the last business day of July, October and January, if found to meet a Business Involvement\nExclusion as of the last business day of the previous month, or (ii) on the third Friday of March, June,\nSeptember and December if found to be a Non\u2011Compliant UNGC Company as of the last business day of the\nprevious month. In addition, between Index rebalances, Index constituents may be removed from the Index for\ntheir involvement in economic crime and corruption, fraud, illegal commercial practices, human rights\nabuses, labor disputes, workplace safety catastrophic accidents, environmental disasters, and certain other\nactivities associated with environmental, social and governance risks. Any companies removed from the Index\non 2 account of such activities are not eligible for inclusion in the Index until one full calendar year\nfrom the next rebalancing of the Index.

The\nvalue of stocks of technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology is particularly\nvulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence, government regulation\nand competition, both domestically and internationally, including competition from foreign competitors with\nlower production costs. Stocks of technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology,\nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market.\nTechnology companies are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability. Additionally, companies in the technology sector may\nface dramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified\npersonnel.\n                                                                                                            \n      The risk chart within the \u201cADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION\u201d section of the Prospectus is updated to (i)   \n  3.  remove \u201cFinancial Sector Risk\u201d and \u201cIndustrial Sector Risk\u201d, and (ii) reflect that \u201cTechnology        \n      Sector Risk\u201d is a principal risk of the Fund.
