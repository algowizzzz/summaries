  "text": "SPDR SERIES TRUST\n\n(the \u0093Trust\u0094)\n\nSupplement dated May 24, 2024 to the Statement of Additional Information (\u0093SAI\u0094)\n\ndated April 30, 2024, as may be supplemented from time to time\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently adopted rule amendments to shorten the standard\nsettlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions from T+2 (i.e., two business days after the trade date)\nto T+1 (i.e., one business day after the trade date), subject to certain exceptions. Consistent with the\nrule amendments, effective May 28, 2024 (the \u0093Effective Date\u0094), each series of the Trust appearing in this\nSAI will generally issue creation units on a T+1 basis and generally deliver redemption proceeds on either a\nT+1, T+2 or T+3 basis. Accordingly, the following changes are made to the SAI as of the Effective Date:\n                                                                                                            \n  1)  The following replaces the discussion under the heading entitled \u0093PROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION  \n      UNITS\u0094 within the section entitled \u0093PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS\u0094:                          \n                                                                                                            \nTo be eligible to\nplace orders with the Principal Underwriter, as facilitated via the Transfer Agent, to purchase a Creation\nUnit of a Fund, an entity must be (i) a \u0093Participating Party\u0094, i.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in\nthe clearing\nprocess through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the \u0093Clearing Process\u0094), a clearing agency\nthat is registered with the SEC; or (ii) a DTC Participant (see \u0093Book Entry Only System\u0094), and (except with\nrespect\nto the SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF and SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury\nBond ETF) must have the ability to clear through the Federal Reserve System. In addition, each Participating\nParty or DTC Participant (each,\nan \u0093Authorized Participant\u0094) must execute a Participant Agreement that has been agreed to by the Principal\nUnderwriter and the Transfer Agent, and that has been accepted by the Trust, with respect to purchases and\nredemptions of Creation\nUnits. Each Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of a Participant Agreement, on behalf\nof itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that it will pay to\nthe Trust, an amount of cash\nsufficient to pay the Cash Component together with the creation transaction fee (described below) and any\nother applicable fees, taxes and additional variable charge.\n\nAll orders to purchase Shares directly from a Fund, including non-standard orders, must be placed for\none or more Creation Units and in the manner and by the time set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or\nthe applicable order form. The date on which an order to purchase Creation Units (or an order to redeem\nCreation Units, as set forth below) is\nreceived and accepted is referred to as the \u0093Order Placement Date.\u0094\n\nAn Authorized Participant may require an investor to make\ncertain representations or enter into agreements with respect to the order (e.g., to provide for payments of\ncash, when required). Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not have executed a\nParticipant Agreement and that,\ntherefore, orders to purchase Shares directly from a Fund in Creation Units have to be placed by the\ninvestor\u0092s broker through an Authorized Participant that has executed a Participant Agreement. In such cases\nthere may be additional charges to\nsuch investor. At any given time, there may be only a limited number of broker-dealers that have executed a\nParticipant Agreement and only a small number of such Authorized Participants may have international\ncapabilities.\n\nOn days when the Exchange or the bond markets close earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to create\nCreation Units to be placed\nearlier in the day. In addition, if a market or markets on which a Fund\u0092s investments are primarily traded\nis closed, the Fund will also generally not accept orders on such day(s). Orders must be transmitted by an\nAuthorized Participant by\ntelephone or other transmission method acceptable to the Distributor pursuant to procedures set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement and in accordance with the applicable order form. Those placing orders through an\nAuthorized Participant should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order by the cut-off time. Economic or market\ndisruptions or changes, or telephone or other communication failure may impede the ability to reach the\nDistributor or an Authorized Participant.\n\nFund Deposits must be delivered by an Authorized Participant through the Federal Reserve System\n(for cash and U.S. government securities), or through DTC (for corporate securities and municipal\nsecurities), through a subcustody agent (for foreign securities) and/or through such other arrangements\nallowed by the Trust or its agents. With\nrespect to foreign Deposit Securities, the Custodian shall cause the subcustodian of a Fund to maintain an\naccount into which the Authorized Participant shall deliver, on behalf of itself or the party on whose\nbehalf it is acting, such Deposit\nSecurities. Foreign Deposit Securities must be delivered to an account maintained at the applicable local\nsubcustodian.\n\n1\n\nThe Fund Deposit transfer must be ordered by the Authorized Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure\nthe delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, to the account of a Fund or its agents by no later than the Settlement Date. The \u0093Settlement\nDate\u0094 with respect to a creation order for a Fund is generally the first Business Day (\u0093T+1\u0094) after the\nOrder Placement\nDate.\n\nAll questions as to the number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as applicable, and the\nvalidity, form and\neligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities or cash, as applicable,\nwill be determined by the Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash\nrepresented by the Cash Component must be\ntransferred directly to the Custodian through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely\nmanner so as to be received by the Custodian no later than the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and\nthe Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash,\nas applicable, are not received in a timely manner by the Settlement Date, the creation order may be\ncancelled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following\nBusiness Day using a Fund Deposit as newly\nconstituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally\nwill occur no later than the first Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed\nreceived by the Distributor.\n\nThe order shall be deemed to be received on the Business Day on which the order is placed provided that the\norder is placed in proper form\nprior to the applicable cut-off time and the federal funds in the appropriate amount are deposited by 2:00\np.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions), with the Custodian on the Settlement\nDate. If the order is not placed in proper form as required, or federal funds in the appropriate amount are\nnot received by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions) on the Settlement Date,\nthen the order may be deemed to be\nrejected and the Authorized Participant shall be liable to the Fund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom.\nA creation request is considered to be in \u0093proper form\u0094 if all procedures set forth in the Participant\nAgreement, order form and\nthis SAI are properly followed.\n\nShortened settlement cycles are expected to be available, through which creation transactions can be\nsettled on the trade date in accordance with instructions provided by the Trust and/or Distributor.\n                                                                                                            \n      The following replaces the discussion under the heading entitled \u0093PROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF         \n  2)  CREATION                                                                                              \n      UNITS\u0094 within the section entitled \u0093PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS\u0094:                          \n                                                                                                            \nAfter the Trust has\ndeemed an order for redemption received, the Trust will initiate procedures to transfer the requisite\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to the Authorized Participant by the Settlement Date.\nThe \u0093Settlement Date\u0094 with\nrespect to a redemption order for a Fund is generally T+1, the second Business Day (\u0093T+2\u0094) or the third\nBusiness Day (\u0093T+3\u0094) after the Order Placement Date. With respect to in-kind\nredemptions of a Fund, the calculation of the value of the Redemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to be delivered upon redemption will be made by the Custodian according to the procedures set forth\nunder \u0093Determination of Net\nAsset Value\u0094, computed on the Business Day on which a redemption order is deemed received by the Trust.\nTherefore, if a redemption order in proper form is submitted to the Principal Underwriter by a DTC\nParticipant by the specified time on the\nOrder Placement Date, and the requisite number of Shares of a Fund are delivered to the Custodian prior to\n2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions) on the Settlement Date, then the value of\nthe Redemption Securities and the\nCash Redemption Amount to be delivered will be determined by the Custodian on such Order Placement Date. If\nthe requisite number of Shares of the Fund are not delivered by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per\napplicable instructions) on the\nSettlement Date, the Fund will not release the underlying securities for delivery unless collateral is\nposted in such percentage amount of missing Shares as set forth in the Participant Agreement (marked to\nmarket daily).\n\nWith respect to in-kind redemptions of a Fund, in connection with taking delivery of shares of\nRedemption Securities upon redemption of Creation Units, an Authorized Participant must maintain appropriate\ncustody arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in\nwhich any of the Redemption\nSecurities are customarily traded (or such other arrangements as allowed by the Trust or its agents), to\nwhich account such Redemption Securities will be delivered. Deliveries of redemption proceeds generally will\nbe made within T+1, T+2 or T+3. The\norder form specifies the date at which the delivery of redemption proceeds for a specific Fund is generally\nexpected to occur.\n\n2\n\nDue to the schedule of holidays in certain countries, however, the delivery of in-kind redemption proceeds\nmay take longer than one, two or three Business Days, as applicable, after the day on which the redemption\nrequest is received in proper form. If the Authorized Participant has not made\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of the Redemption Securities in the applicable foreign\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect\ndeliveries of the Redemption Securities in such\njurisdiction, the Trust may, in its discretion, exercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash, and the\nAuthorized Participant will be required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash.\n\nIf it is not possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of the\nRedemption Securities, the Trust\nmay in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash, and the redeeming investor will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In addition, an investor may request a redemption in\ncash that a Fund may, in its sole\ndiscretion, permit. In either case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the NAV of its Shares\nbased on the NAV of Shares of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in\nproper form (minus a redemption\ntransaction fee and additional charge for requested cash redemptions specified above, to offset the Trust\u0092s\nbrokerage and other transaction costs associated with the disposition of Redemption Securities). A Fund may\nalso, in its sole\ndiscretion, upon request of a shareholder, provide such redeemer a portfolio of securities that differs from\nthe exact composition of the Redemption Securities but does not differ in net asset value.\n\nAn Authorized Participant submitting a redemption request is deemed to represent to the Trust that, as of\nthe close of the Business Day on\nwhich the redemption request was submitted, it (or its client) will own (within the meaning of Rule 200 of\nRegulation SHO) or has arranged to borrow for delivery to the Trust on or prior to the Settlement Date of\nthe redemption request, the\nrequisite number of Shares of the relevant Fund to be redeemed as a Creation Unit. In either case, the\nAuthorized Participant is deemed to acknowledge that: (i) it (or its client) has full legal authority and\nlegal right to tender for\nredemption the requisite number of Shares of the applicable Fund and to receive the entire proceeds of the\nredemption;\n\nand (ii) if\nsuch Shares submitted for redemption have been loaned or pledged to another party or are the subject of a\nrepurchase agreement, securities lending agreement or any other arrangement affecting legal or beneficial\nownership of such Shares being\ntendered, there are no restrictions precluding the tender and delivery of such Shares (including borrowed\nshares, if any) for redemption, free and clear of liens, on the redemption Settlement Date. The Trust\nreserves the right to verify these\nrepresentations at its discretion, but will typically require verification with respect to a redemption\nrequest from a Fund in connection with higher levels of redemption activity and/or short interest in the\nFund. If the Authorized Participant,\nupon receipt of a verification request, does not provide sufficient verification of its representations as\ndetermined by the Trust, the redemption request will not be considered to have been received in proper form\nand may be rejected by the Trust.\n\nRedemptions of Shares for Redemption Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable federal and\nstate securities laws and each\nFund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for\ncash to the extent that the Trust could not lawfully deliver specific Redemption Securities upon redemptions\nor could not do so without first\nregistering the Redemption Securities under such laws. An Authorized Participant or an investor for which it\nis acting subject to a legal restriction with respect to a particular security included in the Redemption\nSecurities applicable to the\nredemption of Creation Units may be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The Authorized Participant may\nrequest the redeeming investor of the Shares to complete an order form or to enter into agreements with\nrespect to such matters as compensating\ncash payment. Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a \u0093qualified institutional buyer,\u0094 (\u0093QIB\u0094) as\nsuch term is defined under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, will not be able to receive Redemption\nSecurities that are\nrestricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A. An Authorized Participant may be required by the\nTrust to provide a written confirmation with respect to QIB status in order to receive Redemption\nSecurities.\n\nThe right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to a Fund (1) for any\nperiod during which the\nExchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (2) for any period during which\ntrading on the Exchange is suspended or restricted; (3) for any period during which an emergency exists as a\nresult of which disposal of the\nShares of the Fund or determination of the NAV of the Shares is not reasonably practicable; or (4) in such\nother circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\n\n3\n                                                                                                   \n  3)  The following replaces the first paragraph within the section entitled \u0093LOCAL MARKET HOLIDAY  \n      SCHEDULES\u0094:                                                                                   \n                                                                                                   \nThe Trust generally intends to effect deliveries of the Funds\u0092 portfolio securities on\nT+1, T+2 or T+3. The ability of the Trust to effect in-kind redemptions within one, two or three Business\nDays, as applicable, of receipt of a redemption request is subject, among other things, to the\ncondition that, within the time period from the date of the request to the date of delivery of the\nsecurities, there are no days that are local market holidays on the relevant Business Days. For every\noccurrence of one or more intervening holidays\nin the local market that are not holidays observed in the United States, the redemption settlement cycle may\nbe extended by the number of such intervening local holidays. In addition to holidays, other unforeseeable\nclosings in a foreign market due\nto emergencies may also prevent the Trust from delivering securities within one, two or three Business Days,\nas applicable.\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE\n\n052424SUPP4\n\n4\n"
