Effective immediately, the discussion in the \u0093PROXY VOTING POLICIES\u0094 section in the SAI is  \n      deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:                                  \n                                                                                                \nThe Board has delegated the responsibility to vote proxies on\nsecurities held by the Funds to the Adviser for all Funds, subject to certain exceptions. Proxy voting for\nthe Municipal Bond ETFs (to the extent applicable) has been delegated to the sub-adviser, Nuveen Asset\nManagement, LLC (\u0093Nuveen Asset\nManagement\u0094). The Board has retained authority to vote proxies for certain bank and bank holding company\nsecurities (\u0093Bank Securities\u0094) that may be held by one or more Funds from time to time. The Board has\nadopted the Institutional\nShareholder Services, Inc.\u0092s (\u0093ISS\u0094) benchmark proxy voting policy with respect to voting such Bank\nSecurities\u0092 proxies. The Board has retained this authority in order to permit the Adviser to utilize\nexemptions from limitations\narising under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, that might otherwise prevent the Adviser\nfrom investing a Fund\u0092s assets in Bank Securities.\n\nCertain Funds that employ an equity index strategy (each such Fund, an \u0093Eligible Fund\u0094 and, collectively,\nthe \u0093Eligible Funds\u0094)\nparticipate in a proxy voting program (the \u0093Program\u0094) administered by the Adviser through which Eligible\nFund shareholders identified by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (as described below) have the option of\nselecting an alternative,\nthird-party proxy voting policy that the Fund will use to vote proxies on securities, including Bank\nSecurities, corresponding to the percentage of the Eligible Fund owned by the shareholder as of the record\ndate of the applicable shareholder\nmeeting. The proxy voting policies made available through the Program comprise proxy voting policies\nmaintained by ISS (each such proxy voting policy, a \u0093Program Proxy Voting Policy\u0094). If an Eligible Fund\nshareholder does not make a\nProgram Proxy Voting Policy selection, the Eligible Fund\u0092s proxies corresponding to the percentage of such\nshareholder\u0092s ownership of the Eligible Fund will be voted in accordance with the Adviser\u0092s proxy voting\npolicy, except with\nrespect to proxies on Bank Securities, which will be voted in accordance with the ISS benchmark proxy voting\npolicy. In an unusual case, the Adviser may override a vote that would otherwise be made pursuant to a\nProgram Proxy Voting Policy if the\nAdviser determines that it is not in the best interests of the Eligible Fund and its shareholders to vote\npursuant to such Program Proxy Voting Policy. This might be the case, for example, if the Adviser becomes\naware that ISS is planning to vote in\na way that creates material concerns related to a conflict of interest with ISS; if the Adviser believes\nthat the voting position, if successful, might have a material impact on an Eligible Fund\u0092s ability to trade\nthe security; if the Adviser\ndetermines that sanctions affecting a company or an individual prevent such a vote; if issuer specific\ndocumentation or market confirmation is required; or if the Adviser determines that custodial restrictions\nor expenses make voting in accordance\nwith the policy inadvisable or impracticable. In the unusual event the Adviser overrides a proxy vote that\nwould otherwise be made pursuant to a Program Proxy Voting Policy, such proxy will be voted in accordance\nwith the Adviser\u0092s proxy voting\npolicy, except with respect to proxies on Bank Securities, which will be voted in accordance with the ISS\nbenchmark proxy voting policy.\n\nThe Adviser has\nengaged Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (\u0093Broadridge\u0094) to periodically, but at least annually, identify\nbeneficial owners of Eligible Fund shares held through a financial intermediary for participation in the\nProgram. Eligible Fund\nshareholders that do not own their Eligible Fund shares as of the most recent date used by Broadridge for\nshareholder identification purposes will not be able to participate in the Program (but may be eligible to\nparticipate in the future if\nidentified as an Eligible Fund shareholder by Broadridge at a later date). It is also possible that some\nEligible Fund shareholders that own Eligible Fund shares as of the most recent date used by Broadridge for\nshareholder identification purposes\nmay not be able to participate in the Program if the beneficial ownership information for their shares is\nnot immediately available to Broadridge (e.g., where a shareholder\u0092s financial intermediary is not part of\nBroadridge\u0092s network of\nfinancial intermediaries that provides shareholder information to Broadridge or where a shareholder has\nobjected to its financial intermediary releasing the shareholder\u0092s personal\n\ninformation to issuers for proxy voting purposes). Eligible Fund shareholders identified by Broadridge will\nreceive a communication that will invite such shareholders to participate in the\nProgram by selecting a Program Proxy Voting Policy on the Program\u0092s website. Shareholders should carefully\nread Program communications and the Program\u0092s website for more details regarding how Eligible Fund\nshareholders may participate in\nthe Program, how Eligible Fund shareholders may change or cancel their Program Proxy Voting Policy\nselection, risk factors associated with the Program and how an Eligible Fund shareholder\u0092s selection of a\nspecific Program Proxy Voting Policy\nwill be implemented. Shareholders may call 1-866-787-2257 for a list of Funds that are currently\nparticipating in the Program.\n\nEach of the Trust\u0092s, the Adviser\u0092s and Nuveen Asset Management\u0092s proxy voting policy, ISS\u0092 benchmark proxy\nvoting policy, as well as\neach Program Proxy Voting Policy, is attached as an appendix to this SAI.

On environmental or social matters, the Global Board-Aligned Policy will generally be in\nline with the board\u0092s\nrecommendations, with support limited to circumstances where it is considered that greater disclosure will\ndirectly enhance or protect shareholder value and is reflective of a clearly established reporting standard\nin the market. Details are as\nfurther described in these guidelines.\n                                                              \n  W W W . I S S G O V E R N A N C E .

Board of Directors\n\nVoting on Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections\n\nFour fundamental principles apply when determining votes on director nominees:\n\nIndependence:Boards should be sufficiently independent from management (and significant shareholders) to\nensure that they are able and motivated to effectively supervise management\u0092s performance for the benefit of\nall shareholders, including in setting and monitoring the execution of corporate strategy, with appropriate\nuse of shareholder capital, and in setting and monitoring executive compensation programs that support that\nstrategy. The chair of the board should ideally be an independent director, and all boards should have an\nindependent leadership position or a similar role in order to help provide appropriate counterbalance to\nexecutive management, as well as having sufficiently independent committees that focus on key governance\nconcerns such as audit, compensation, and nomination of directors.\n\nComposition:Companies should ensure that directors add value to the board through their specific skills and\nexpertise and by having sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. Boards should be of a size\nappropriate to accommodate diversity, expertise, and independence, while ensuring active and collaborative\nparticipation by all members. Boards should be sufficiently diverse to ensure consideration of a wide range\nof perspectives.\n\nResponsiveness:Directors should respond to investor input, such as that expressed through significant\nopposition to management proposals, significant support for shareholder proposals (whether binding or non-\nbinding),and tender offers where a majority of shares are tendered.\n\nAccountability:Boards should be sufficiently accountable to shareholders, including through transparency of\nthe company\u0092s governance practices and regular board elections, by the provision of sufficient information\nfor shareholders to be able to assess directors and board composition, and through the ability of\nshareholders to remove directors.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for director nominees, except under the following circumstances (with\nnew nominees 1considered on case-by-casebasis):\n\nIndependence\n\nVote against2 or withhold from non-independent directors\n(Executive Directors and Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors per ISS\u0092 Classification of Directors) when:\n                                                                        \n  \u00a7    Independent directors comprise 50\u00a0percent or less of the board;  \n                                                                        \n                                                                                      \n  \u00a7    The non-independent director serves on the audit, compensation, or nominating  \n       committee;                                                                     \n                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so that the full board functions   \n       as that committee; or                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       The company lacks a formal nominating committee, even if the board attests that the independent      \n  \u00a7    directors fulfill the                                                                                \n       functions of such a committee.                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n1A \u0093new nominee\u0094 is a director who is being presented for election by shareholders for the first\ntime. Recommendations on new nominees who have served for less than one year are made on a case-by-case\nbasis depending on the timing of their appointment and the\nproblematic governance issue in question.\n\n2In general, companies with a plurality vote standard\nuse \u0093Withhold\u0094 as the contrary vote option in director elections; companies with a majority vote standard\nuse \u0093Against\u0094. However, it will vary by company and the proxy must be checked to determine the valid\ncontrary vote option\nfor the particular company.\n                                                              \n  W W W .

Current interim officers\nare included in this category. For private companies, the equivalent positions are applicable. A\nnon-employee director serving as an officer due to statutory requirements (e.g. corporate secretary) will\ngenerally be classified as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director under \u0093Any material relationship with\nthe company.\u0094 However, if the company provides explicit disclosure that the director is not receiving\nadditional compensation exceeding $10,000\nper year for serving in that capacity, then the director will be classified as an Independent Director.\n\n2.\n\u0093Affiliate\u0094 includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. ISS uses 50 percent control ownership\nby the parent company as the standard for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor of an\nexternally managed\nissuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate.\n\n3. Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the company\u0092s initial\npublic offering (IPO).\n\n4. When there is a former CEO of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) serving on the board\nof an acquired company, ISS will generally classify such directors as independent unless determined\notherwise taking into account the following factors: the applicable listing standards determination of such\ndirector\u0092s independence; any\noperating ties to the firm; and the existence of any other conflicting relationships or related party\ntransactions.\n\n5.ISS will look at the terms of the interim officer\u0092s employment contract to determine if it contains\nseverance pay, long-term health and pension benefits, or other such standard provisions typically contained\nin contracts of permanent, non-temporary CEOs. ISS will also consider if a formal search process was\nunder way for a full-time officer at the time.\n\n6.\u0093Immediate family member\u0094 follows the SEC\u0092s\ndefinition of such and covers spouses, parents, children, step-parents, step-children, siblings, in-laws,\nand any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of any director, nominee for\ndirector, executive officer, or significant shareholder of the company.\n\n7. Professional services can be characterized as\nadvisory in nature, generally involve access to sensitive company information or to strategic decision-\nmaking, and typically have a commission- or fee-based payment structure. Professional services generally\ninclude but are not limited to the following: investment banking/financial advisory services, commercial\nbanking (beyond deposit services), investment services, insurance services, accounting/audit services,\nconsulting services, marketing services,\nlegal services, property management services, realtor services, lobbying services, executive search\nservices, and IT consulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional\nrelationships and not professional services: deposit\nservices, IT tech support services, educational services, and construction services. The case of\nparticipation in a banking syndicate by a non-lead bank should be considered a transactional (and hence\nsubject\nto the associated materiality test) rather than a professional relationship. \u0093Of Counsel\u0094 relationships are\nonly considered immaterial if the individual does not receive any form of compensation (in excess of $10,000\nper year) from, or is\na retired partner of, the firm providing the professional service. The case of a company providing a\nprofessional service to one of its directors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated,\nwill be considered a transactional\nrather than a professional relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be\nprofessional services unless the company explains why such services are not advisory.\n\n8. A material transactional relationship, including grants to non-profit organizations,\nexists if the company makes annual payments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity, exceeding\nthe greater of: $200,000 or 5 percent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues, for a company that follows NASDAQ\nlisting standards; or\nthe greater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues, for a company that follows NYSE\nlisting standards. For a company that follows neither of the preceding standards, ISS will apply the NASDAQ-\nbased materiality test.\n(The recipient is the party receiving the financial proceeds from the transaction).\n\n9. Dissident directors who are parties\nto a voting agreement pursuant to a settlement or similar arrangement may be classified as Independent\nDirectors if an analysis of the following factors indicates that the voting agreement does not compromise\ntheir alignment with all\nshareholders\u0092 interests: the terms of the agreement; the duration of the standstill provision in the\nagreement; the limitations and requirements of actions that are agreed upon; if the dissident director\nnominee(s) is subject to the standstill;\nand if there any conflicting relationships or related party transactions.\n\n10.Interlocks include: executive\nofficers serving as directors on each other\u0092s compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence of such\na committee, on the board); or executive officers sitting on each other\u0092s boards and at least one serves on\nthe other\u0092s\ncompensation or similar committees (or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board).\n\n11. The\noperating involvement of the founder with the company will be considered; if the founder was never employed\nby the company, ISS may deem him or her an Independent Director.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

For purposes of ISS\u0092s director independence classification, \u0093material\u0094 will be defined as a\nstandard of relationship (financial, personal, or otherwise) that a reasonable person might conclude could\npotentially influence one\u0092s objectivity in the boardroom in a manner that would have a meaningful impact on\nan individual\u0092s ability\nto satisfy requisite fiduciary standards on behalf of shareholders.\n\nComposition\n\nAttendance at Board and Committee Meetings:Generally vote against or withhold from directors (except\nnominees who served only part of the fiscal year 3) who attend less than 75 percent of the aggregate of\ntheir board and committee meetings for the period for which they served, unless an acceptable reason for\nabsences is disclosed in the proxy or another SEC filing. Acceptable reasons for director absences are\ngenerally limited to the following:\n                                \n  \u00a7    Medical issues/illness;  \n                                \n                                \n  \u00a7    Family emergencies; and  \n                                \n                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Missing only one meeting (when the total of all meetings is three or fewer).  \n                                                                                     \nIn cases of chronic poor attendance without reasonable justification, in addition to voting against the\ndirector(s) with poor attendance, generally vote against or\nwithhold from appropriate members of the nominating/governance committees or the full board.\n\nIf the proxy disclosure is unclear and insufficient to determine\nwhether a director attended at least 75 percent of the aggregate of his/her board and committee meetings\nduring his/her period of service, vote against or withhold from the director(s) in question.\n\nOverboarded Directors:Generally vote against or withhold from individual directors who:\n                                                        \n  \u00a7    Sit on more than five public company boards; or  \n                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n       Are CEOs of public companies who sit on the boards of more than two public companies besides their   \n  \u00a7    own\u0097withhold only                                                                                     \n       at their outside boards4.                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nGender Diversity :Generally vote against or withhold from the chair of the nominating committee (or other\ndirectors on a case-by-casebasis) at companies where there are no women on the company\u0092s board. An exception\nwill be made if there was at least one woman on the board at the preceding annual meeting and the board\nmakes a firm commitment to return to a gender-diverse status within a year.\n\nRacial and/or Ethnic Diversity :For companies in the Russell 3000 or S&P 1500 indices, generally vote\nagainst or withhold from the chair of the nominating committee (or other directors on a case-by-casebasis)\nwhere the board has no apparent racially or ethnically diverse members 5.

Shareholder Rights & Defenses\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals/Nominations\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon advance notice proposals, giving support to those proposals which\nallow shareholders to submit proposals/nominations as close to the meeting date as reasonably possible and\nwithin the broadest window possible, recognizing the need to allow sufficient notice for company,\nregulatory, and shareholder review.\n\nTo be reasonable, the company\u0092s\ndeadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/nominations must be no earlier than 120 days prior to the\nanniversary of the previous year\u0092s meeting and have a submittal window of no shorter than 30 days from the\nbeginning of the notice period\n(also known as a 90-120-day window). The submittal window is the period under which shareholders must file\ntheir proposals/nominations prior to the deadline.\n\nIn general, support additional efforts by companies to ensure full disclosure in regard to a proponent\u0092s\neconomic and voting position in the company so long as\nthe informational requirements are reasonable and aimed at providing shareholders with the necessary\ninformation to review such proposals.\n\nAmend Bylaws without Shareholder Consent\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote against proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws.\n\nVote case-by-case on proposals\ngiving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition to shareholders, taking into account the\nfollowing:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Any impediments to shareholders\u0092 ability to amend the bylaws (i.e. supermajority voting               \n       requirements);                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                        \n  \u00a7    The company\u0092s ownership structure and historical voting turnout;  \n                                                                        \n                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Whether the board could amend bylaws adopted by shareholders; and  \n                                                                          \n                                                                                                \n  \u00a7    Whether shareholders would retain the ability to ratify any board-initiated amendments.  \n                                                                                                \nControl Share Acquisition Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing so\nwould enable the completion of a takeover that would be detrimental to shareholders.\n\nVote against proposals to\namend the charter to include control share acquisition provisions.\n\nVote for proposals to restore voting rights to the control shares.\n\nControl share acquisition statutes function by denying shares their voting rights when they contribute to\nownership in excess of certain thresholds. Voting rights for\nthose shares exceeding ownership limits may only be restored by approval of either a majority or\nsupermajority of disinterested shares. Thus, control share acquisition statutes effectively require a\nhostile bidder to put its offer to a shareholder\nvote or risk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder continues buying up a large block of shares.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

In other words, when an investor crosses a preset threshold level, remaining shareholders\nare given the right to sell their shares to the acquirer, who must buy them at the highest acquiring price.\n\nDisgorgement Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state disgorgement provisions.\n\nDisgorgement provisions require an acquirer or potential acquirer of more than a certain percentage of a\ncompany\u0092s stock to\ndisgorge, or pay back, to the company any profits realized from the sale of that company\u0092s stock purchased\n24 months before achieving control status. All sales of company stock by the acquirer occurring within a\ncertain period of time (between\n18 months and 24 months) prior to the investor\u0092s gaining control status are subject to these recapture-of-\nprofits provisions.\n\nFair Price Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon proposals to adopt fair price provisions (provisions that\nstipulate that an acquirer must pay the same price to acquire all shares as it paid to acquire the control\nshares), evaluating factors such as the vote required to approve the proposed acquisition, the vote required\nto repeal the fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair price.\n\nGenerally vote against fair price provisions with shareholder vote requirements greater than a majority of\ndisinterested shares.\n\nFreeze-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state freeze-outprovisions. Freeze-outprovisions\nforce an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a company to wait a specified period of\ntime before gaining control of the company.\n\nGreenmail\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments or otherwise\nrestrict a company\u0092s ability to make greenmail payments.\n\nVote case-by-case on anti-greenmail proposals when they are bundled with other charter or bylaw amendments.\n\nGreenmail\npayments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock from individuals or groups seeking\ncontrol of the company.

SVT is expressed as both a\ndollar amount and as a percentage of market value, and includes the new shares proposed, shares available\nunder existing plans, and shares\ngranted but unexercised (using two measures, in the case of plans subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard\nevaluation, as noted above). All award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are placed on\nthe most expensive types of awards\n(for example, full-value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be granted will be the most\nexpensive types.\n\nFor proposals that are not subject to\nthe Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value Transfer is reasonable if it falls below a company-\nspecific benchmark. The benchmark is determined as follows: The top quartile performers in each industry\ngroup (using the Global Industry\nClassification Standard: GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are established based\non these top performers\u0092 historic SVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the\nvariables most strongly\ncorrelated to SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the specific\ncompany by plugging the company-specific performance measures, size, and cash compensation into the industry\ncap equations to arrive at the\ncompany\u0092s benchmark.21\n\nThree-Year Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\n\nA \u0093Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\u0094 is used for stock plan evaluations. Value-Adjusted Burn Rate benchmarks are\ncalculated\nas the greater of: (1) an industry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the company\u0092s\nGICS group segmented by S&P 500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&P 500) and\nnon-Russell 3000 index; and (2) a de minimisthreshold established separately for each of the S&P 500, the\nRussell 3000 index less the S&P 500, and the\nnon-Russell 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-rate benchmark changes will be limited to a predetermined range\nabove or below the prior year\u0092s burn-rate benchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate is calculated as follows:\n\nValue-Adjusted Burn\nRate = ((# of options * option\u0092s dollar value using a Black-Scholes model) + (# of full-value awards * stock\nprice)) / (Weighted average common shares * stock price).\n\nEgregious Factors\n\nLiberal Change in Control Definition\n\nGenerally vote against equity plans if the plan has a liberal definition of change in control and the equity\nawards could vest upon such liberal definition of change\nin control, even though an actual change in control may not occur.

The proposal should clearly articulate why the board is\nchoosing to conduct an exchange program at this point in time. Repricing underwater options after a recent\nprecipitous drop in the\ncompany\u0092s stock price demonstrates poor timing and warrants additional scrutiny. Also, consider the terms of\nthe surrendered options, such as the grant date, exercise price and vesting schedule. Grant dates of\nsurrendered options should be far\nenough back (two to three years) so as not to suggest that repricings are being done to take advantage of\nshort-term downward price movements. Similarly, the exercise price of surrendered options should be above\nthe\n52-week high for the stock price.\n\nVote for shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Many companies have adopted policies that permit recoupment in cases where\nan executive\u0092s fraud, misconduct, or negligence significantly contributed to a restatement of financial\nresults that led to the\nawarding of unearned incentive compensation. However, such policies may be narrow given that not all\nmisconduct or negligence may result in significant financial restatements.

In those circumstances where it is widely considered that greater disclosure will\ndirectly enhance or protect\nshareholder value and is reflective of a clearly established reporting standard in the market, the Global\nBoard-Aligned Policy will generally recommend in support of such proposals (e.g. proposals requesting\ngreater disclosure of a\ncompany\u0092s political contributions and/or trade association spending policies and activities). In the absence\nof a clear determination that environmental and social proposals will have a positive effect on shareholder\nvalue or there are\nproposals that seek information that exceeds a widely endorsed standard in the market or place any burden\nupon the company beyond a reasonable and clearly established reporting standard in the market, the Global\nBoard-Aligned policy will generally\nrecommend voting against such proposals, or in line with the board\u0092s recommendations if different.\n                                                                                                            \n   Say                                                                                                      \n   on Climate (SoC) Management Proposals                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote with the board\u0092s recommendation on management proposals that request\nshareholders to approve the company\u0092s climate transition action plan.22\n\nSay on Climate (SoC) Shareholder Proposals\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote against shareholder proposals that request the company to disclose a\nreport providing its GHG emissions levels and reduction targets and/or its upcoming/approved climate\ntransition action plan and provide shareholders the opportunity to express approval or disapproval of its\nGHG emissions reduction plan.\n\n22Variations of this request also include climate transition related ambitions, or commitment to reporting\non the implementation of a climate plan.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

As fiduciaries,\npublic funds trustees must act with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then\nprevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the\nconduct of an enterprise of a like\ncharacter and with like aims.\n\nThe execution of proxy-voting rights at shareholder meetings is a required duty of pension fund fiduciaries.\nThe U.S. Department of\nLabor (DOL) has stated that the fiduciary act of managing plan assets that are shares of corporate stock\nincludes the voting of proxies appurtenant to those shares of stock and that trustees may delegate this duty\nto an investment manager.1 While public pension plans are not directly subject to the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), most do generally comply with the position set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of\nLabor in 1988 with regard to the fiduciary responsibilities governing the voting of shares of stock owned by\nthe plan.\n\nThese proxy voting guidelines are designed\nto help ensure that public funds fulfill all statutory and common law obligations governing proxy voting,\nwith the intent of maximizing the long-term economic benefits of its plan participants, beneficiaries, and\ncitizens of the state in which the\nfund resides. This includes an obligation to vote proxies in a manner consistent with sound corporate\ngovernance and responsible corporate citizenship. Sound corporate governance and responsible corporate\npractices lead to increased long-term\nshareholder value.\n\nWhile these guidelines often provide explicit guidance on how to vote proxies with regard to specific issues\nthat appear on ballot, they are\nnot intended to be exhaustive. Hundreds of issues appear on proxy ballots every year; as such, it is neither\npractical nor reasonable to fashion voting guidelines and policies which attempt to address every\neventuality. Rather, these guidelines are\nintended to cover the most significant and frequent proxy issues that arise. Each proxy issue should be\nsubject to a rigorous analysis of the economic impact of the issue on the long-term share value. All votes\nshall be cast solely in the long-term\ninterest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan.\n\nThese proxy voting guidelines address a broad range of issues, including election of directors,\nexecutive compensation, auditor ratification, proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender offer\ntakeover defenses. In addition to governance issues, these guidelines address broader issues of corporate\ncitizenship that can also have a\ndirect impact on corporate performance and important stakeholder interests, including climate risk, job\nsecurity and wage parity, local economic development and stability, and workplace safety and health issues.\nIn accordance with state laws, the\npolicies take into consideration actions that promote good corporate citizenship through the proxy process.\n\n1 Most public sector pension plans, regulatory bodies, and professional associations have adopted the views\nof the U.S. Department of Labor on fiduciary duties related to proxy voting. The\nDepartment of Labor\u0092s Employee Benefits Security Administration (previously known as the Pension and Welfare\nBenefits Administration) has stated in opinion letters and an interpretative bulletin that the voting rights\nrelated to shares of stock\nheld by pension plans are plans assets. Therefore, according to the Department, \u0093the fiduciary act of\nmanaging plan assets which are shares of corporate stock would include the voting of proxies appurtenant to\nthose shares of stock.\u0094\nSources include: the Department of Labor Opinion Letter (Feb.23, 1988), reprinted in 15 Pens.

Director Elections\n\nElecting directors is the single most important stock ownership right that shareholders can exercise. By\nelecting directors who share their views, shareholders can\nhelp to define performance standards against which management can be held accountable. Public Fund Advisory\nServices holds directors to a high standard when voting on their election, qualifications, and compensation.\nPublic Fund Advisory Services\nevaluates directors fairly and objectively, rewarding them for significant contributions and holding them\nultimately accountable to shareholders for corporate performance. Institutional investors should use their\nvoting rights in uncontested\nelections to influence financial performance and corporate strategies for achieving long term shareholder\nvalue.\n\nDirector accountability, independence and\ncompetence have become issues of prime importance to investors given the failings in oversight exposed by\nthe global financial crisis. There is also concern over the environment in the boardrooms of certain\nmarkets, where past failures appear to be\nno impediment to continued or new appointments at major companies and may not be part of the evaluation\nprocess at companies in considering whether an individual is, or continues to be, fit for the role and best\nable to serve shareholders\u0092\ninterests.\n\nVoting on Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections\n\nVotes concerning the entire board of directors and members of key board committees are examined using the\nfollowing factors:\n\nBoard Independence:Without independence from management, the board and/or its committees may be unwilling or\nunable to effectively set company strategy and scrutinize performance or executive compensation.\n\nBoard Competence:Companies should seek a diverse board of directors who can add value to the board through\nspecific skills or expertise and who can devote sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. While\ndirectors should not be constrained by arbitrary limits such as age or term limits, directors who are unable\nto attend board and committee meetings and/or who are overextended (i.e. serving on too many boards) raise\nconcern on the director\u0092s ability to effectively serve in shareholders\u0092 best interests.\n\nBoard Accountability:Practices that promote accountability include: transparency into a company\u0092s governance\npractices, annual board elections, and providing shareholders the ability to remove problematic directors\nand to vote on takeover defenses or other charter/bylaw amendments. These practices help reduce the\nopportunity for management entrenchment.\n\nBoard Responsiveness:Directors should be responsive to shareholders, particularly in regard to shareholder\nproposals that receive a majority vote or management proposals that receive low shareholder support, and to\ntender offers where a majority of shares are tendered. Boards should also be sufficiently responsive to high\nwithhold/against votes on directors. Furthermore, shareholders should expect directors to devote sufficient\ntime and resources to oversight of the company.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Votes on individual director nominees are always made on a\ncase-by-case basis. Specific director nominee withhold/against 2votes can be triggered by one or more of the\nfollowing factors:\n\n2 In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use \u0093Withhold\u0094 as the valid contrary vote option in\ndirector elections; companies with a majority vote standard use\n\u0093Against\u0094. However, it will vary by company and the proxy must be checked to determine the valid contrary\nvote option for the particular company.\n                                                              \n  W W W .

Independence will be evaluated based upon a\nnumber of factors, including:\nemployment by the company or an affiliate in an executive capacity; past or current employment by a firm\nthat is one of the company\u0092s paid advisors or consultants; a personal services contract with the company;\nfamily relationships of an\nexecutive or director of the company; interlocks with other companies on which the company\u0092s chair or chief\nexecutive officer is also a board member; and service with a non-profit organization that receives\nsignificant contributions from the\ncompany.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Generally vote against or withhold votes from non-independent director nominees (executive           \n  \u00a7    directors and non-independent,                                                                       \n       non-executive directors) where the entire board is not at least majority independent.                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally vote against or withhold votes from non-independent director nominees when the             \n  \u00a7    nominating, compensation and                                                                         \n       audit committees are not fully independent.                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally consider directors who have been on the board continually for a period longer than 10      \n  \u00a7    years as non-independent,                                                                            \n       non-executive directors.                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals requesting that all key board committees (i.e. audit, compensation    \n  \u00a7    and/or nominating)                                                                                   \n       include independent directors exclusively.                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals requesting that the board be comprised of a majority of independent   \n       directors.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nNon-Independent Chair\n\nTwo major components at the top of every public company are the running of the board and the executive\nresponsibility for the running of the company\u0092s business.\nMany institutional investors believe there should be a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the\ncompany that will ensure a balance of power and authority, such that no one individual has unfettered powers\nof decision. When there is no\nclear division between the executive and board branches of a company, poor executive and/or board actions\noften go unchecked to the ultimate detriment of shareholders. Since executive compensation is so heavily\ncorrelated to the managerial power\nrelationship in the boardroom, the separation of the CEO and chair positions is a critical step in\ncurtailing excessive pay, which ultimately can become a drain on shareholder value.\n\nArguments have been made that a smaller company and its shareholders can benefit from the full-time\nattention of a joint chair and CEO. This may be so in select\ncases, and indeed, using a case-by-case review of circumstances there may be worthy exceptions. But, even in\nthese cases, it is the general view of many institutions that a person should only serve in the position of\njoint CEO and chair on a\ntemporary basis, and that these positions should be separated following their provisional combination.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services strongly believes that the\npotential for conflicts of interest in the board\u0092s supervisory and oversight duties trumps any possible\ncorollary benefits that could ensue from a dual CEO/chair scenario. Instead of having an ingrained quid pro\nquo situation whereby a company\nhas a single leader overseeing both management and the\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Shareholder interests are placed in jeopardy if the CEO of a company is required to report to a\nboard that she/he also\nchairs.\n\nInherent in the chair\u0092s job description is the duty to assess the CEO\u0092s performance. This objectivity is\nobviously compromised when a chair is\nin charge of evaluating her/his own performance or has a past or present affiliation with management.\nMoreover, the unification of chair and CEO poses a direct threat to the smooth functioning of the entire\nboard process since it is the ultimate\nresponsibility of the chair to set the agenda, facilitate discussion, and make sure that directors are given\ncomplete access to information in order to make informed decisions.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Generally support shareholder proposals calling for the separation of the CEO and chair positions.  \n                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally support shareholder proposals calling for a non-executive director to serve as chair who   \n  \u00a7    is not a former CEO or                                                                               \n       senior-level executive of the company.                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nCompetence\n\nExcessive Directorships\n\nAs new\nregulations mandate that directors be more engaged and vigilant in protecting shareholder interests or else\nrisk civil and/or criminal sanctions, board members have to devote more time and effort to their oversight\nduties. Recent surveys of U.S.\ndirectors confirm a desire for limiting board memberships, to between three and five seats. In view of the\nincreased demands placed on corporate board members, Public Fund fiduciaries believe that directors who are\noverextended may be impairing\ntheir ability to serve as effective representatives of shareholders. Public Fund Advisory Services will\nrecommend a vote against or withhold from directors serving on an excessive number of other boards, which\ncould compromise their primary duties\nof care and loyalty.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote against or withhold votes from directors serving\non an excessive number of boards. As a general rule, vote against or withhold from director nominees who\nare:\n                                                                                                            \n       CEOs of publicly-traded companies who serve on more than one public boards besides their own.

As part of the\nframework for assessing director performance,\nPublic Fund Advisory Services will also evaluate board accountability and oversight at companies that\n\n9 Although all of a CEO\u0092s subsidiary boards will be counted as\nseparate boards, Public Fund Advisory Services will not recommend a withhold/against vote from the CEO of a\nparent company board or any of the controlled (>50 percent ownership) subsidiaries of that parent, but will\ndo so at subsidiaries that are\nless than 50 percent controlled and boards outside the parent/subsidiary relationships.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

A governance\nstructure that discourages director accountability may lead to board and management entrenchment. For\nexample, the existence of several anti-takeover provisions* has the cumulative effect of deterring\nlegitimate tender offers, mergers, and corporate\ntransactions that may have ultimately proved beneficial to shareholders. When a company maintains\nentrenchment devices, shareholders of poorly performing companies are left with few effective routes to\nbeneficial change.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services will assess the company\u0092s response to the ongoing performance issues, and\nconsider recent board and management changes, board\nindependence, overall governance practices, and other factors that may have an impact on shareholders. If a\ncompany exhibits sustained poor performance coupled with a lack of board accountability and oversight,\nPublic Fund Advisory Services\u0092\nevaluation may also consider the company\u0092s operational metrics and other factors as warranted.\n\n*Problematic provisions include but are not limited to:\n                                      \n  \u00a7    A classified board structure;  \n                                      \n                                          \n  \u00a7    A supermajority vote requirement;  \n                                          \n                                                                                                            \n       Either a plurality vote standard in uncontested director elections or a majority vote standard with  \n  \u00a7    no plurality                                                                                         \n       carve-out for contested elections;                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                 \n  \u00a7    The inability for shareholders to call special meetings;  \n                                                                 \n                                                                  \n  \u00a7    The inability for shareholders to act by written consent;  \n                                                                  \n                                        \n  \u00a7    A multi-class structure; and/or  \n                                        \n                                                \n  \u00a7    A non-shareholder approved poison pill.  \n                                                \nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote against or withhold votes from all director nominees if\nthe board lacks accountability and oversight, coupled with sustained poor performance relative to peers.\nSustained poor performance is measured by one-, three-, and five-year total shareholder returns in the\nbottom half of a company\u0092s four-digit GICS industry group (Russell 3000 companies only). Sustained poor\nperformance for companies outside the Russell 3000 universe is defined as underperforming peers or index on\nthe basis of one-, three-, and five-year total shareholder returns.\n\nClassified Boards ~ Annual Elections\n\nThe ability to elect directors is the single most important use of the shareholder franchise, and all\ndirectors should be accountable on an annual basis. Annually\nelected boards provide the best governance system for accountability to shareholders. A classified board is\na board that is divided into separate classes, with directors serving overlapping terms. A company with a\nclassified board usually divides\nthe board into three classes. Under this system, only one class of nominees comes up to shareholder vote at\nthe AGM each year.\n\nAs a consequence of these\nstaggered terms, shareholders only have the opportunity to vote on a single director approximately once\nevery three years. A classified board makes it difficult to change control of the board through a proxy\ncontest since it would normally take two\nyears to gain control of a majority of board seats. Under a classified board, the possibility of management\nentrenchment greatly increases. Classified boards can reduce director accountability by shielding directors,\nat least for a certain period of\ntime, from the consequences of their actions. Continuing directors who are responsible for a problematic\ngovernance issue at the board/committee level would avoid shareholders\u0092 reactions to their actions because\nthey would not be up for\nelection in that year. Ultimately, in these cases, the full board should be responsible for the actions of\nits directors.\n\nMany in management believe that\nstaggered boards provide continuity. Some shareholders believe that in certain cases a staggered board can\nprovide consistency and continuity in regard to decision-making and commitment that may be important to the\nlong-term financial future of the\ncompany. Nevertheless, empirical evidence strongly suggests that staggered boards are generally not in the\nshareholders\u0092 best interest. In addition to shielding directors from being held accountable by shareholders\non an annual basis, a\nclassified board can entrench management and effectively preclude most takeover bids or proxy contests.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Boards that fail to do so should be held accountable for ultimately\ndisregarding shareholders\u0092 interests. In applying this principle to voting in uncontested director\nelections, Public Fund Advisory Services\nconsiders the term of the pill an important factor, as shorter term pills are generally less onerous as a\ntakeover defense when compared to longer term pills, and may in some cases provide the board with a valuable\ntool to maximize shareholder value\nin the event of an opportunistic offer.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n\nGenerally vote against or withhold votes from all nominees (except new nominees4, who should be considered\non a case-by-case basis) if;\n                                                                                                            \n       The company has a long-term poison pill (with a term of over one year) that was not approved by the  \n  \u00a7    public                                                                                               \n       shareholders10;                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       The board makes a material adverse change to an existing pill, including, but not limited to,        \n  \u00a7    extension, renewal, or                                                                               \n       lowering the trigger, without shareholder approval; or                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                  \n  \u00a7    The company has a poison pill with a deadhand or slowhand  \n       feature11.                                                 \n                                                                  \nVote case-by-case on nominees if the board adopts an initial short-term\npillError!

Diversity brings different\nperspectives to a board that in turn leads to a more varied\napproach to board issues. Public Fund fiduciaries generally believe that increasing diversity in the\nboardroom would better reflect a company\u0092s workforce, customers, and community and enhance shareholder\nvalue.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Support proposals asking the board to make greater efforts to search for qualified female and        \n  \u00a7    minority candidates for                                                                              \n       nomination to the board of directors.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  \u00a7    Support endorsement of a policy of board inclusiveness.  \n                                                                \n                                                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Support reporting to shareholders on a company\u0092s efforts to increase diversity on their boards.  \n                                                                                                       \nStock Ownership Requirements\n\nCorporate directors should own some amount of stock of the companies on which they serve as board members.\nStock ownership is a simple method to align the interests\nof directors with company shareholders. Nevertheless, many highly qualified individuals such as academics\nand clergy who can offer valuable perspectives in boardrooms may be unable to purchase individual shares of\nstock. In such a circumstance, the\npreferred solution is to look at the board nominees individually and take stock ownership into consideration\nwhen voting on the merits of each candidate.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally support shareholder proposals requiring directors to\nown a minimum amount of company stock, provided these requests afford a carve-out for directors who do not\nhave the financial means to purchase company stock or a grace period within which to own a reasonable amount\nof stock.\n\nBoard and Committee Size\n\nWhile there is no hard and fast rule among institutional investors as to what may be an optimal board size,\nthere is an acceptable range that companies should strive\nto meet and not exceed. A board that is too large may function inefficiently. Conversely, a board that is\ntoo small may allow the CEO to exert disproportionate influence or may stretch the time requirements of\nindividual directors too thin.\n\nProposals seeking to set board size will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Given that the preponderance\nof boards in the U.S. range between five and fifteen\ndirectors, many institutional investors believe this benchmark is a useful standard for evaluating such\nproposals.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Generally vote against any proposal seeking to amend the company\u0092s board size to fewer than five      \n       seats.                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Generally vote against any proposal seeking to amend the company\u0092s board size to more than fifteen    \n       seats;                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Evaluate board size on a case-by-case basis and consider withhold or against votes or other action   \n  \u00a7    at companies that have                                                                               \n       fewer than five directors and more than 15 directors on their board.                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

While term of office\nlimitations can rid the board of non-performing directors over time, it can also unfairly force experienced\nand effective directors off the board. When evaluating shareholder proposals on director term limits,\nconsider whether the company\u0092s\nperformance has been poor and whether problematic or entrenching governance provisions are in place at the\ncompany. Additionally, consider board independence, including whether the board chair is independent.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote against shareholder proposals to limit the\ntenure of outside directors.\n\nCumulative Voting\n\nMost corporations provide that shareholders are entitled to cast one vote for each share owned. Under a\ncumulative voting scheme, the shareholder is permitted to have\none vote per share for each director to be elected. Shareholders are permitted to apportion those votes in\nany manner they wish among the director candidates. Thus, under a cumulative-voting scheme, shareholders\nhave the opportunity to elect a\nminority representative to a board by cumulating their votes, thereby ensuring minority representation for\nall sizes of shareholders.\n\nFor example, if there is a\ncompany with a ten-member board and 500 shares outstanding-the total number of votes that may be cast is\n5,000. In this case a shareholder with 51 shares (10.2 percent of the outstanding shares) would be\nguaranteed one board seat because all votes\nmay be cast for one candidate. Without cumulative voting, anyone controlling 51 percent of shares would\ncontrol the election of all ten directors.\n\nWith the\nadvent and prevalence of majority voting for director elections, shareholders now have greater flexibility\nin supporting candidates for a company\u0092s board of directors. Cumulative voting and majority voting are two\ndifferent voting mechanisms\ndesigned to achieve two different outcomes. While cumulative voting promotes the interests of minority\nshareholders by allowing them to get some representation on the board, majority voting promotes a democratic\nelection of directors for all\nshareholders and ensures board accountability in uncontested elections. Though different in philosophic\nview, cumulative voting and majority voting can work together operationally, with companies electing to use\nmajority voting for uncontested\nelections and cumulative voting for contested elections to increase accountability and ensure minority\nrepresentation on the board.\n\nIn contested elections,\nsimilar to cumulative voting, proxy access allows shareholder access to the ballot without a veto from the\nnominating committee, but unlike cumulative voting, it also requires majority support to elect such\ndirectors.\n\nAt controlled companies, where majority insider control would preclude minority shareholders from having any\nrepresentation on the board, cumulative voting would\nallow such representation and shareholder proposals for cumulative voting would be supported.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Generally vote against proposals to eliminate cumulative voting;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Generally vote for proposals to restore or provide for cumulative voting unless:  \n                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The company has proxy access thereby allowing shareholders to nominate directors to the company\u0092s     \n       ballot; and                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       The company has adopted a majority vote standard, with a carve-out for plurality voting in           \n  \u00a7    situations where there are                                                                           \n       more nominees than seats, and a director resignation policy to address failed elections.             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals for cumulative voting at controlled companies (where insider voting power         \n       exceeds 50%).                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

(e.g. although the dissident nominees may    \n       have received more shares cast, as long as the                                                       \n       combination of withhold/against votes and the votes for the management nominees keep the dissident   \n       nominees under 50%, the management nominees will win, due to the holdover rules). This clearly       \n       contradicts the expressed will of shareholders.                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       In addition to supporting proposals seeking a majority vote standard in director elections, Public   \n       Fund Advisory Services                                                                               \n  \u00a7    also supports a post-election \u0093director resignation policy\u0094 that addresses the situation of holdover   \n       directors to accommodate both shareholder proposals and the need for stability and continuity of     \n       the board.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nShareholder Access to the Proxy\n\nThe current director election process as it exists leaves much to be desired. Companies currently nominate\nfor election only one candidate for each board seat.\nShareholders who oppose a candidate have no easy way to do so unless they are willing to undertake the\nconsiderable expense of running an independent candidate for the board. The only way for shareholders to\nregister dissent about a certain director\ncandidate is to vote against or \u0093withhold\u0094 support from that nominee. But because directors are still\nlargely elected by a plurality (those nominees receiving the most votes win board seats) at a large\nproportion of firms in the U.S.,\nnominees running unopposed are typically reelected despite shareholder opposition.\n\nMany investors view proxy access as an important shareholder right, one that\nis complementary to other best-practice corporate governance features. Public Fund Advisory Services is\ngenerally supportive of reasonably crafted shareholder proposals advocating for the ability of long-term\nshareholders to cost-effectively\nnominate director candidates that represent their interests on management\u0092s proxy card. Shareholder\nproposals that have the potential to result in abuse of the proxy access right by way of facilitating\nhostile takeovers will generally not be\nsupported.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for management and shareholder proposals for\nproxy access with the following provisions:\n                                                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Ownership threshold: maximum requirement not more than three percent (3%)\u00a0of the voting power;  \n                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n       Ownership duration: maximum requirement not longer than three (3)\u00a0years of continuous ownership for  \n  \u00a7    each                                                                                                 \n       member of the nominating group;                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Aggregation: minimal or no limits on the number of shareholders permitted to form a nominating       \n       group;                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                  \n  \u00a7    Cap: cap on nominees of generally twenty-five percent (25%)\u00a0of the board.  \n                                                                                  \nReview for reasonableness any other restrictions on the right of proxy access.\n\nGenerally vote against proposals that are more restrictive than these guidelines.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Charter amendments\nmay also include limited liability\nwherein a person\u0092s financial liability is limited to a fixed sum, or personal financial assets are not at\nrisk if the individual loses a lawsuit that results in financial award/damages to the plaintiff. In\ncontrast, shareholder proposals seek\nto provide for personal monetary liability for fiduciary breaches arising from gross negligence.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services may support these proposals when\nthe company persuasively argues that such action is necessary to attract and retain directors, but will\nlikely oppose management proposals and support shareholder proposals in order to promote greater\naccountability.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case, considering the stated rationale for the\nproposed change, on proposals to limit or eliminate entirely director and officer liability in regard to:\n(i) breach of the director\u0092s fiduciary \u0093duty of loyalty\u0094 and \u0093duty of care\u0094 to shareholders; (ii) acts or\nomissions not made in \u0093good faith\u0094 or involving intentional misconduct or knowledge of violations under the\nlaw; (iii) acts involving the unlawful purchases or redemptions of stock; (iv) payment of unlawful\ndividends; or (v) use of the position as director for receipt of improper personal benefits.\n\nDirector and Officer Indemnification\n\nIndemnification is the payment by a company of the expenses of directors who become involved in litigation\nas a result of their\nservice to a company. Proposals to indemnify a company\u0092s directors differ from those to eliminate or reduce\ntheir liability because with indemnification directors may still be liable for an act or omission, but the\ncompany will bear the\nexpense. Public Fund fiduciaries may support these proposals when the company persuasively argues that such\naction is necessary to attract and retain directors, but should generally oppose indemnification when it is\nbeing proposed to insulate\ndirectors from actions that have already occurred.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote case-by-case, considering the stated rationale for the proposed change, on indemnification      \n  \u00a7    proposals that would                                                                                 \n       expand individual coverage beyond ordinary legal expenses to also cover specific acts of negligence  \n       that are more serious violations of fiduciary obligation than mere carelessness.                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote case-by-case, considering the stated rationale for the proposed change, on proposals that       \n       would expand the scope of                                                                            \n  \u00a7    indemnification to provide for mandatory indemnification of company officials in connection with     \n       acts that previously the company was permitted to provide indemnification for at the discretion of   \n       the company\u0092s board (i.e., \u0093permissive                                                                 \n       indemnification\u0094) but that previously the company was not required to indemnify.                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

Compensation\n\nThe housing market collapse and resulting credit crisis resulted in significant erosion of shareholder\nvalue, unprecedented levels of market volatility, and a lack of\nconfidence among financial market participants. Many Public Fund trustees have questioned the role of\nexecutive compensation in incentivizing inappropriate or excessive risk-taking behavior by executives that\ncould threaten a corporation\u0092s\nlong-term viability. Further, generous severance packages and other payments to departing executives of\nfailed institutions have heightened attention on the issue of pay for performance.\n\nTrustees of funds, which have lost significant value in their investments as a result of the financial\ncrisis, have little patience for \u0093pay for failure\u0094\nand continue to press for the adoption of executive compensation practices aimed at creating and sustaining\nlong-term shareholder value.\n\nCompanies have long\nargued that legally binding executive compensation obligations cannot be modified. The\n\nCapital Purchase Program implemented under the Emergency Economic\nStabilization Act of 2008, the \u0093bail out\u0094 program for the U.S. financial system, set the tone for executive\ncompensation reform and requires participating firms to accept certain limits and requirements on executive\ncompensation,\nregardless of existing contractual arrangements. A number of firms agreed to these requirements.\n\nEvolving disclosure requirements have opened a wider window into\ncompensation practices and processes, giving shareholders more opportunity and responsibility to ensure that\npay is designed to create and sustain shareholder value. Companies in the U.S. are now required to evaluate\nand discuss potential risks\narising from misguided or misaligned compensation programs. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act requires advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation (management \u0093Say on Pay\u0094), an\nadvisory vote on the\nfrequency of Say on Pay, as well as a shareholder advisory vote on golden parachute compensation. The advent\nof \u0093Say on Pay\u0094 votes for shareholders in the U.S. has provided a new communication mechanism and impetus\nfor constructive\nengagement between shareholders and managers/directors on pay issues.\n\nEvaluation of Executive Pay\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services believes that executive pay programs should be fair, competitive, reasonable,\nand appropriate, and that pay for performance should be a\ncentral tenet in executive compensation philosophy. When evaluating executive and director pay programs and\npractices, Public Fund Advisory Services looks for the following best practice considerations in the design\nand administration of executive\ncompensation programs:\n                                                                                                            \n       Appropriate pay-for-performance alignment with emphasis on long-term shareholder value: executive    \n       pay practices                                                                                        \n       must be designed to attract, retain, and appropriately motivate the key employees who drive          \n  \u00a7    shareholder value creation over the long term. Evaluating appropriate alignment of pay incentives    \n       with shareholder value creation includes taking into                                                 \n       consideration, among other factors, the link between pay and performance, the mix between fixed and  \n       variable pay, performance goals, and equity-based plan costs.                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Avoiding arrangements that risk \u0093pay for failure\u0094: this includes assessing the appropriateness of      \n  \u00a7    long                                                                                                 \n       or indefinite contracts, excessive severance packages, and guaranteed compensation.                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Independent and effective compensation committee: oversight of executive pay programs by directors   \n  \u00a7    with                                                                                                 \n       appropriate skills, knowledge, experience, and a sound process for compensation decision-making      \n       (e.g., including access to independent expertise and advice when needed) should be promoted.         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Clear, comprehensive compensation disclosures: shareholders expect companies to provide informative  \n  \u00a7    and timely                                                                                           \n       disclosures that enable shareholders to evaluate executive pay practices fully and fairly.           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Avoiding inappropriate pay to non-executive directors: compensation to outside directors should not  \n  \u00a7    compromise                                                                                           \n       their independence and ability to make appropriate judgments in overseeing managers\u0092 pay and          \n       performance.                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

A short-term focus on performance does not necessarily create sustainable           \n  \u00a7    shareholder value. Instead, long-term goals may be sacrificed to achieve short-term expectations to  \n       the detriment of shareholder value, as evidenced by the                                              \n       financial crisis.                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nCompensation programs embedding a long-term focus with respect to company goals better align with the long-\nterm interests of\nshareholders. Granting stock options and restricted stock to executives that vest in five years does not\nnecessarily provide a long-term focus, as executives can sell off the company shares once they vest.\nHowever, requiring senior executives to\nhold company stock until retirement or after retirement can encourage a long-term focus on company\nperformance.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Therefore,\nit is important to closely examine any discrepancies between CEO pay and total shareholder returns over a\nsustained period of time in assessing equity-based compensation. Many investors do not consider standard\nstock options or time-vested\nrestricted stock to be performance-based. If a company provides performance-based incentives to its\nexecutives, the company should provide complete disclosure of the performance measures and goals to allow\nshareholders to assess the rigor of the\nperformance program. Complete and transparent disclosure enables shareholders to better comprehend the\ncompany\u0092s pay for performance linkage.\n\nWhen financial\nor operational measures are utilized in incentive awards, the achievements related to these measures should\nultimately translate into superior shareholder returns in the long-term. The use of non-GAAP financial\nmetrics makes it very challenging for\nshareholders to ascertain the rigor of the program as shareholders often cannot tell the type of adjustments\nbeing made and if the adjustments were made consistently.\n\nPay-for-performance should be a central tenet in executive compensation philosophy. In evaluating the degree\nof alignment between the CEO\u0092s pay with the\ncompany\u0092s performance over a sustained period, Public Fund Advisory\n\nServices conducts a pay-for-performance analysis.\n\nWith respect to companies in the Russell 3000 or Russell 3000E Indices10, this analysis considers the\nfollowing:\n                               \n  1.

The SEC has issued\nrules on executive and director compensation that require expansive disclosure and a total compensation\nfigure for each of the named\nexecutive officers. Poorly designed executive compensation plans or those lacking in transparency can be\nreflective of a poorly performing compensation committee.\n\nExecutive compensation will continue to be in the spotlight in the ensuing years, particularly when\nshareholders are expected to have access to more complete\ninformation.\n\nProblematic pay elements are generally evaluated case-by-case considering the context of a company\u0092s overall\npay program and demonstrated\npay-for-performance philosophy. The focus is on executive compensation practices that contravene best\npractice compensation considerations, including:\n                                                                                      \n  \u00a7    Problematic practices related to non-performance-based compensation elements;

This non-binding shareholder vote on compensation must\nbe included in a proxy or\nconsent or authorization at least once every 3 years.\n\nIn general, the management say on pay (MSOP) ballot item is the primary focus of voting on executive pay\npractices \u0096 dissatisfaction with compensation practices can be expressed by voting against MSOP rather than\nvoting against or withhold from the compensation committee. However, if there is no MSOP on the ballot, then\nthe negative vote will\napply to members of the compensation committee. In addition, in egregious cases, or if the board fails to\nrespond to concerns raised by a prior MSOP proposal, then Public Fund fiduciaries should vote against or\nwithhold votes from compensation\ncommittee members (or, if the full board is deemed accountable, all directors). If the negative factors\ninvolve equity-based compensation, then a vote against an equity-based plan proposal presented for\nshareholder approval may be warranted.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Evaluate executive pay and practices, as well as certain aspects of outside director compensation    \n  \u00a7    on a case-by-case                                                                                    \n       basis.                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  \u00a7    Vote against management say on pay (MSOP) proposals if:  \n                                                                \n                                                                                              \n  \u00a7    There is an unmitigated misalignment between CEO pay and company performance (pay for  \n       performance);                                                                          \n                                                                                              \n                                                               \n  W W W .

The MSOP is at its essence a communication vehicle, and communication is most useful when\nit is received in a consistent and timely manner. Support for an annual MSOP vote is merited for many of the\nsame reasons Public Fund Advisory\nServices supports annual director elections rather than a classified board structure: because this provides\nthe highest level of accountability and direct communication by enabling the MSOP vote to correspond to the\nmajority of the information\npresented in the accompanying proxy statement for the applicable shareholders\u0092 meeting. Having MSOP votes\nevery two or three years, covering all actions occurring between the votes, would make it difficult to\ncreate the meaningful and coherent\ncommunication that the votes are intended to provide. Under triennial elections, for example, a company\nwould not know whether the shareholder vote references the compensation year being discussed or a previous\nyear, making it more difficult to\nunderstand the implications of the vote.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for annual advisory votes on compensation, which provide\nthe most consistent and clear communication channel for shareholder concerns about companies\u0092 executive pay\nprograms.\n\nAdvisory Vote on Golden Parachutes in an Acquisition, Merger, Consolidation, or Proposed Sale\n\nThis is a proxy item regarding specific advisory votes on \u0093golden parachute\u0094 arrangements for Named\nExecutive Officers (NEOs) that is required under The\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Indeed, a number of academic studies have found that there is\nlimited correlation between executive stock ownership and company performance. Misused stock options can\ngive executives an incentive to\ninflate their company\u0092s earnings, take excessive risks, and make irresponsibly optimistic forecasts in order\nto keep stock prices high and their paychecks gargantuan.\n\nTherefore, it is vital for shareholders to fully analyze all equity plans that appear on ballot.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:general, Public Fund Advisory Services evaluates executive and\ndirector compensation plans on a case-by-case basis.

Stock options, restricted stock and other forms of\nnon-cash compensation should be performance-based with an eye toward improving long-term corporate value.\nWell-designed stock option plans can align the interests of executives and shareholders by providing that\nexecutives benefit when stock prices\nrise so that the employees of the company, along with shareholders, prosper together. Likewise, option plans\nshould not allow for the benefits of share price gains without the risk of share price declines. Poorly\ndesigned stock option plans can\nencourage excessive risk-taking behavior and incentivize executives to pursue corporate strategies that\npromote short-term stock price to the ultimate detriment of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMany plans sponsored by management provide goals so easily attained that executives can realize massive\nrewards even though shareholder value is not created. Public\nFund Advisory Services supports option plans when they provide legitimately challenging performance targets\nthat serve to truly motivate executives in the pursuit of sustained superior performance. Moreover, equity\npay plans should be designed in a\nfashion that ensures executive compensation is veritably performance driven and \u0093at risk\u0094 such that\nexecutives are penalized (by either reducing or withholding compensation) for failure to meet pre-determined\nperformance hurdles. Public\nFund Advisory Services will oppose those plans that offer unreasonable benefits to executives that are not\ngenerally available to other shareholders or employees.\n\nVoting Power Dilution (VPD) Calculation\n\nVoting power dilution, or VPD, measures the amount of voting power represented by the number of shares\nreserved over the life of the plan. Industry norm dictates that\nten percent dilution over the life of a ten-year plan is reasonable for most mature companies. Restricted\nstock plans or stand-alone stock bonus plans that are not coupled with stock option plans can be held to a\nlower dilution cap.\n\nVoting power dilution may be calculated using the following formula:\n                                                  \n  A:  Shares reserved for this amendment or plan  \n                                                  \n                                                                                            \n  B:  Shares available under this plan and/or continuing plans prior to proposed amendment  \n                                                                                            \n                                                                              \n  C:  Shares granted but unexercised under this plan and/or continuing plans  \n                                                                              \n                                                                                         \n  D:  All outstanding shares plus any convertible equity, outstanding warrants, or debt  \n                                                                                         \n                                                           \n  The\u00a0formula\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0applied\u00a0as\u00a0follows:    A\u00a0+\u00a0B\u00a0+\u00a0C      \n                                            A\u00a0+\u00a0B\u00a0+\u00a0C\u00a0+\u00a0D  \n                                                           \nFair Market Value, Dilution and Repricing\n\nConsideration will be made as to whether the proposed plan is being offered at fair market value or at a\ndiscount; whether the plan excessively dilutes the earnings\nper share of the outstanding shares; and whether the plan gives management the ability to replace or reprice\n\u0093underwater\u0094 options. Repricing is an amendment to a previously granted stock option contract that reduces\nthe option exercise\nprice. Options are \u0093underwater\u0094 when their current price is below the current option contract price. Options\ncan also be repriced through cancellations and re-grants. The typical new grant would have a ten-year term,\nnew vesting\nrestrictions, and a lower exercise price reflecting the current lower market price.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

A\n\u0093Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\u0094 is used for stock plan evaluations. Public Fund Advisory Services will generally\noppose plans whose Value-Adjusted Burn Rates exceed the greater of: (1) an industry-specific threshold based\non three-year\nburn rates within the company\u0092s GICS group segmented by S&P 500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&P 500) and\nnon-Russell 3000 index; and (2) a de minimis threshold established separately for each of the S&P 500, the\nRussell 3000\nindex less the S&P 500, and the non-Russell 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-rate benchmark changes will be\nlimited to a predetermined range above or below the prior year\u0092s burn-rate benchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate is calculated as follows:\n\nValue-Adjusted Burn\nRate = ((# of options * option\u0092s dollar value using a Black-Scholes model) + (# of full-value awards * stock\nprice)) / (Weighted average common shares * stock price).\n\nExecutive Concentration Ratio\n\nIn examining\nstock option awards, restricted stock and other forms of long-term incentives, it is important to consider\ninternal pay equity; that is, the concentration and distribution of equity awards to a company\u0092s top five\nexecutives (\u0093named\nofficers\u0094) as a percentage of overall grants. Public Fund Advisory Services will consider voting against\nequity compensation plans whose annual grant rate to top executives exceeds fifteen percent of shares\ngranted.\n\nEvergreen Provisions\n\nPublic Fund Advisory\nServices will oppose plans that reserve a specified percentage of outstanding shares for award each year\n(evergreen plans) instead of having a termination date. Such plans provide for an automatic increase in the\nshares available for grant with or\nwithout limits on an annual basis. Because they represent a transfer of shareholder value and have a\ndilutive impact on a regular basis, evergreen plans are expensive to shareholders. Evergreen features also\nminimize the frequency that companies\nseek shareholder approval in increasing the number of shares available under the plan.\n\nOption Exchange Programs/Repricing Options\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a\nshareholder vote.\n\nVote case-by-case on management proposals\nseeking approval to exchange/reprice options taking into consideration the following factors:\n                                                                                                            \n       Historic trading patterns: the stock price should not be so volatile that the options are likely to  \n  \u00a7    be back                                                                                              \n       \u0093in-the-money\u0094 over the near term;                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                              \n  \u00a7    Rationale for the re-pricing: was the stock price decline beyond management\u0092s control?  \n                                                                                              \n                                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Option vesting: does the new option vest immediately or is there a black-out period?  \n                                                                                             \n                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Term of the option: the term should remain the same as that of the replaced option;  \n                                                                                            \n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Exercise price: should be set at fair market or a premium to market;  \n                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Participants: the plan should be broad-based and executive officers and directors should be          \n       excluded;                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                            \n  \u00a7    Is this a value-for-value exchange?  \n                                            \n                                                                      \n  \u00a7    Are surrendered stock options added back to the plan reserve?  \n                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Timing--repricing should occur at least one year out from any precipitous drop in company\u0092s stock     \n       price.                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

The proposal should\nclearly articulate why the board is choosing to conduct an exchange program at this point in time. Repricing\nunderwater options after a recent precipitous drop in the company\u0092s stock price demonstrates poor timing.\nPublic Fund Advisory Services\ndoes not view market deterioration, in and of itself, as an acceptable reason for companies to reprice stock\noptions and/or reset goals under performance plans. Repricing after a recent decline in stock price triggers\nadditional scrutiny and may\nwarrant a vote against the proposal. At a minimum, the decline should not have happened within the past\nyear. Public Fund Advisory Services also considers the terms of the surrendered options, such as the grant\ndate, exercise price and vesting\nschedule. Grant dates of surrendered options should be far enough back (two to three years) so as not to\nsuggest that repricings are being done to take advantage of short-term downward price movements. Similarly,\nthe exercise price of surrendered\noptions should be above the 52-week high for the stock price.\n\nRestricted Stock\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services supports the use of performance-vesting restricted stock as long as the\nabsolute amount of restricted stock being granted is a\nreasonable proportion of an executive\u0092s overall compensation. The best way to align the interests of\nexecutives with shareholders is through direct stock holdings, coupled with at-risk variable compensation\nthat is tied to explicit and\nchallenging performance benchmarks. Performance-vesting restricted stock both adds to executives\u0092 direct\nshare holdings and incorporates at-risk features.\n\nTo reward performance and not job tenure, restricted stock vesting requirements should be performance-based\nrather than time lapsing. Such plans should explicitly\ndefine the performance criteria for awards to senior executives and may include a variety of corporate\nperformance measures in addition to the use of stock price targets. In addition, executives should be\nrequired to hold their vested restricted\nstock as long as they remain employees of the company.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) - Qualified Plans\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on qualified employee stock purchase plans.\nVote for plans if:\n                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Purchase price is at least 85 percent of fair market value;  \n                                                                    \n                                                  \n  \u00a7    Offering period is 27 months or less; and  \n                                                  \n                                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    The number of shares allocated to the plan is ten percent or less of the outstanding shares.  \n                                                                                                     \nEmployee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) \u0096 Non-Qualified Plans\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on nonqualified employee stock purchase\nplans.

Recent academic\nresearch of the performance of ESOPs in closely held companies found that ESOPs appear to increase overall\nsales, employment, and sales per employee over what would have been expected absent an ESOP. Studies have\nalso found that companies with an\nESOP are also more likely to still be in business several years later, and are more likely to have other\nretirement oriented benefit plans than comparable non-ESOP companies.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for proposals that request shareholder approval in order\nto implement an ESOP or to increase authorized shares for existing ESOPs except in cases when the number of\nshares allocated to the ESOP is deemed excessive (i.e. generally greater than five percent of outstanding\nshares).\n\nOBRA-Related Compensation Proposals\n\nCash bonus plans can be an important part of an executive\u0092s overall pay package, along with stock-based\nplans tied to long-term total shareholder returns.\nSection 162(m) of the IRS Code Section limits the deductibility of compensation in excess of $1 million to a\nnamed executive officer unless certain prescribed actions are taken including shareholder approval and the\nestablishment of performance\ngoals.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Generally vote for proposals to approve or amend executive incentive bonus plans if the proposal:  \n                                                                                                          \n                                                    \n  \u00a7    Is only to include administrative features;

For example,\ncompensation devices like executive pensions (SERPs), deferred compensation plans, below-market-rate loans\nor guaranteed post-retirement consulting fees can amount to significant liabilities to shareholders and it\nis often difficult for investors to\nfind adequate disclosure of their full terms. Public Fund Advisory Services opposes any perquisite or\nbenefit to executives that exceeds what is generally offered to other company employees. From a shareholder\nprospective, the cost of these\nexecutive entitlements would be better allocated to performance-based forms of executive compensation during\ntheir term in office.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n\nGenerally vote for shareholder proposals requesting to put extraordinary benefits contained in SERP\nagreements to a shareholder vote unless the company\u0092s\nexecutive pension plans do not contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered under employee-wide plans.\n\nGenerally vote for shareholder proposals calling\ncompanies to adopt a policy of discontinuing or obtaining shareholder approval for any future agreements and\ncorporate policies that could oblige the company to make payments or awards following the death of a senior\nexecutive. This could come, for\nexample, in the form of unearned salary or bonuses, accelerated vesting or the continuation in force of\nunvested equity grants, perquisites and other payments or awards made in lieu of compensation. However, this\nwould not apply to any benefit\nprograms or equity plan proposals that the broad-based employee population is eligible.\n\nExecutive Holding Periods\n\nSenior level executives should be required to hold a substantial portion of their equity compensation\nawards, including shares received from\noption exercises (e.g. 75% of their after-tax stock option proceeds), while they are employed at a company\nor even into retirement. Equity compensation awards are intended to align management interests with those of\nshareholders, and allowing\nexecutives to sell these shares while they are employees of the company undermines this purpose. Given the\nlarge size of a typical annual equity compensation award, holding requirements that are based on a multiple\nof cash compensation may be\ninadequate.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on shareholder proposals asking companies to\nadopt policies requiring senior executive officers to retain a portion of net shares acquired through\ncompensation plans while employed or following the termination of their employment.\n\nPay for Superior Performance\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for shareholder proposals that request the board\nto establish a pay-for-superior performance standard in the company\u0092s executive compensation programs for\nsenior executives.\n\nPerformance-Based Options\n\nStock options are intended to align the interests of management with those of shareholders. However, stock\noption grants without performance-based elements can\nexcessively compensate executives for stock increases due solely to a general stock market rise, rather than\nimproved or superior company stock performance. When option grants reach the hundreds of thousands, a\nrelatively small increase in the share\nprice may permit executives to reap millions of dollars without providing material benefits to shareholders.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Auditors\n\nAuditors play an integral role in certifying the integrity and reliability of corporate financial statements\non which investors rely to gauge the financial well-being\nof a company and the viability of an investment. The well-documented auditor-facilitated bankruptcies and\nscandals at several large public companies in recent years underscore the catastrophic consequences that\ninvestors can suffer when the audit\nprocess breaks down.\n\nAuditor Independence\n\nThe wave of accounting scandals over the past decade illuminates the need to ensure auditor independence in\nthe face of consulting services to audit clients. The\nratio of non-audit services to total revenues at the large accounting firms grew significantly leading up to\nthe accounting scandals. Public Fund Advisory Services believes the ratio of non-audit fees should make up\nno more than one-quarter of all\nfees paid to the auditor so as to properly discourage even the appearance of any undue influence upon an\nauditor\u0092s objectivity.\n\nUnder SEC rules, disclosed\ncategories of professional fees paid for audit and non-audit services are as follows: (1) Audit Fees, (2)\nAudit-Related Fees, (3) Tax Fees, and (4) All Other Fees. Under the reporting requirements, companies are\nrequired to\ndescribe \u0096 in qualitative terms \u0096 the types of services provided under the three categories other than Audit\nFees. The following fee categories are defined as: A) tax compliance or preparation fees are excluded from\nour calculations of\nnon-audit fees; and B) fees for consulting services for tax-avoidance strategies and tax shelters will be\nincluded in \u0093other fees\u0094 and will be considered non-audit fees if the proxy disclosure does not indicate the\nnature of the tax\nservices. In circumstances where \u0093Other\u0094 fees include fees related to significant one-time capital structure\nevents: initial public offerings, bankruptcy emergence, and spin-offs; and the company makes public\ndisclosure of the amount and\nnature of those fees which are an exception to the standard \u0093non-audit fee\u0094 category, then such fees may be\nexcluded from the non-audit fees considered in determining the ratio of non-audit to audit/audit-related\nfees/tax compliance and\npreparation for purposes of determining whether non-audit fees are excessive.\n\nAs auditors are the backbone upon which a company\u0092s financial health is\nmeasured, auditor independence is absolutely essential for rendering objective opinions upon which investors\nthen rely. When an auditor is paid excessive consulting fees in addition to fees paid for auditing, the\ncompany-auditor relationship is left\nopen to conflicts of interest.\n\nAuditor Ratification\n\nThe ratification of auditors is an important component of good governance. In light of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002 and increased shareholder scrutiny, some\ncompanies are opting to take auditor ratification off the ballot. Neglecting to include the ratification of\nauditors on the proxy takes away the fundamental shareholder right to ratify the company\u0092s choice of\nauditor. Whereas shareholder\nratification of auditors was once considered routine by many shareowners, accounting scandals have caused\nshareholders to be more vigilant about the integrity of the auditors certifying their companies\u0092 financial\nstatements. It is now viewed as\nbest practice for companies to place the item on ballot.\n\nAlthough U.S. companies are not legally required to allow shareholders to ratify their appointment of\nindependent auditors, submission of the audit firm for approval at the annual meeting on an annual basis\ngives shareholders the means to weigh in on their satisfaction (or lack thereof) of the auditor\u0092s\nindependent execution of their duties.\nPublic Fund Advisory Services believes mandatory auditor ratification is in line with sound and transparent\ncorporate governance and remains an important mechanism to ensure the integrity of the auditor\u0092s work. In\nthe absence of legislation\nmandating shareholder ratification of auditors, the failure by a company to present its selection of\nauditors for shareholder ratification should be discouraged as it undermines good governance and\ndisenfranchises shareholders.\n\nProposals to ratify auditors is examined for potential conflicts of interest, with particular attention to\nthe fees paid to the auditor, as well as whether the\nratification of auditors has been put up for shareholder vote.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Such long-standing relationships\nfoster an undesirable coziness between audit firms and their clients, which can cause the auditors to lose\ntheir independence and become less questioning especially where lucrative contracts for the provision of\nnon-audit consulting services are\ninvolved. Mandatory auditor rotation is a widely supported safeguard against improper audits and is viewed\nby many as an effective mechanism for mitigating the potential risks borne by long-term auditor-client\nrelationships.\n\nProponents of compulsory audit firm rotation contend that rotation policies promote objectivity and\nindependence among auditors and minimize the scope of vested\ninterests developing in the audit. Opponents of audit firm rotation argue that regular re-tendering is a\ncostly practice, likely to reduce audit quality and increase the risk of audit failure in the early years\ndue to the time required to gain\ncumulative knowledge of an often complex and geographically diverse business. A solution around this\napparent negative effect of mandatory rotation is to keep a longer rotation period.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services recommends that companies not maintain the same audit firm in excess of seven\nyears, and will vote against auditors if their tenure at a\ncompany exceeds seven years. A revolving seven-year rotation period allows the auditor to develop cumulative\nknowledge of a company\u0092s business and the effect of changes in the business along with the corresponding\nchanges in its risks, thereby\nenhancing the quality of the audit and trammeling potential loss of auditor objectivity and independence.\nMany institutional investors argue that the increased costs associated with compulsory auditor rotation are\na lesser evil vis-\u00e0-vis the\nlarger evil of the costs to shareholders when the objectionable coziness between clients and long-standing\nauditors leads to gross erosion of shareholder value.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally support shareholder proposals to ensure auditor\nindependence through measures such as mandatory auditor rotation (no less than every seven years).\n\nAuditor Indemnification and Limitation of Liability\n\nIndemnification clauses allow auditors to avoid liability for potential damages, including punitive damages.\nEliminating concerns about\nbeing sued for carelessness could lead to; 1) potential impairment of external auditor independence and\nimpartiality by contractual clauses limiting their liability; and 2) a decrease in the quality and\nreliability of the audit given the lack of\nconsequence for an inadequate audit.\n\nGiven the substantial settlements against auditors in recent years for poor audit practices and the cost of\nsuch insurance\nto the company and its shareholders, there are legitimate concerns over the broader use of indemnification\nclauses. Such agreements may weaken the objectivity, impartiality and performance of audit firms.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services believes it is important for shareholders to understand the full risks and\nimplications of these agreements and determine what impact\nthey could have on shareholder value. At the present time, however, due to poor disclosure in this area, it\nis difficult to identify the existence and extent of limited liability provisions and auditor agreements,\nand investors lack the information\nneeded to make informed decisions regarding these agreements.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

As such, Public Fund Advisory Services reviews the use\nof indemnification clauses and limited liability provisions in auditor agreements on a case-by-case basis,\nwhen disclosure is present.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote against or withhold from audit committee members if there\nis persuasive evidence that the audit committee entered into an inappropriate indemnification agreement with\nits auditor that limits the ability of the company, or its shareholders, to pursue legitimate legal recourse\nagainst the audit firm.\n\nDisclosures Under Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that companies document and assess the effectiveness of their\ninternal financial controls.\nBeginning in 2005, most public companies must obtain annual attestation of the effectiveness of their\ninternal controls over financial reporting from their outside auditors. Companies with significant material\nweaknesses identified in the\nSection 404 disclosures potentially have ineffective internal financial reporting controls. This may lead to\ninaccurate financial statements, which hampers shareholders\u0092 ability to make informed investment decisions,\nand may lead to\ndestruction of public confidence and shareholder value. The audit committee is ultimately responsible for\nthe integrity and reliability of the company\u0092s financial information and its system of internal controls.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote against or withhold votes from audit committee members under certain circumstances when a       \n  \u00a7    material weakness rises to                                                                           \n       a level of serious concern, if there are chronic internal control issues, or if there is an absence  \n       of established effective control mechanisms.                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote against management proposals to ratify auditors if there is reason to believe that the          \n  \u00a7    independent auditor has                                                                              \n       rendered an opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company\u0092s financial position.     \n                                                                                                            \nAdverse Opinions\n\nAn Adverse Opinion on the company\u0092s financial statements is issued when the auditor determines that the\nfinancial statements\nare materially misstated and, when considered as a whole, do not conform to GAAP. It essentially states that\nthe information contained is materially incorrect, unreliable, and inaccurate in order to assess the\ncompany\u0092s financial position and\nresults of operations.\n\nAdverse opinions on companies\u0092 financial statements are generally very rare because they essentially state\nthat a significant portion\nof the financial statements are unreliable, and the auditor had no choice but to issue an adverse opinion\nafter a long process of seeking resolution with the company subjected to the audit.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote against or withhold votes from audit committee members if\nthe company receives an Adverse Opinion on the company\u0092s financial statements from its auditors.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Takeover Defense\n\nPoison Pills\n\nShareholder rights plans, typically known as poison pills, take the form of rights or warrants issued to\nshareholders and are triggered when a potential acquiring\nstockholder reaches a certain threshold of ownership. When triggered, poison pills generally allow\nshareholders to purchase shares from, or sell shares back to, the target company (\u0093flip-in pill\u0094) and/or the\npotential acquirer\n(\u0093flip-out pill\u0094) at a price far out of line with fair market value.\n\nDepending on the type of pill, the triggering event can either transfer wealth\nfrom the target company or dilute the equity holdings of current shareholders. Poison pills insulate\nmanagement from the threat of a change in control and provide the target board with veto power over takeover\nbids. Because poison pills greatly\nalter the balance of power between shareholders and management, shareholders should be allowed to make their\nown evaluation of such plans.\n\nIn evaluating\nmanagement proposals on poison pills, Public Fund Advisory Services considers the company\u0092s rationale for\nadopting the pill and its existing governance structure in determining whether or not the pill appropriately\nserves in shareholders\u0092\nbest interests. The rationale for adopting the pill should be thoroughly explained by the company.\nAdditionally, Public Fund Advisory Services examines the company\u0092s existing governance structure including:\nboard independence, existing takeover\ndefenses, or any problematic governance concerns.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals that ask a company to submit its poison pill for shareholder          \n       ratification.                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Vote case-by-case on shareholder proposals to redeem a company\u0092s poison pill.  \n                                                                                     \n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Vote case-by-case on management proposals to ratify a poison pill.  \n                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote against or withhold from any board where a dead-hand poison pill provision is in place.

Directors of companies with these  \n       lethal protective devices should be held fully accountable.                                          \n                                                                                                            \nNet Operating Loss (NOL) Poison Pills/Protective Amendments\n\nThe financial crisis prompted widespread losses in certain industries. This resulted in previously\nprofitable companies considering the adoption of a poison pill\nand/or NOL protective amendment to protect their NOL tax assets, which may be lost upon an acquisition of 5\npercent of a company\u0092s shares.\n\nWhen evaluating\nmanagement proposals seeking to adopt NOL pills or protective amendments, the purpose behind the proposal,\nits terms, and the company\u0092s existing governance structure should be taken into account to assess whether\nthe structure actively promotes\nboard entrenchment or adequately protects shareholder rights. While the high estimated tax value of NOLs\nwould typically benefit shareholders, the ownership acquisition limitations contained in an NOL\npill/protective amendment coupled with a\ncompany\u0092s problematic governance structure could serve as an antitakeover device.\n\nGiven the low ownership thresholds involved, shareholders want to ensure\nthat such pills/amendments do not remain in effect permanently. Public Fund Advisory Services will closely\nreview whether the pill/amendment contains a sunset provision or a commitment to cause the expiration of the\nNOL pill/protective amendment\nupon exhaustion or expiration of the NOLs.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Many companies have sought shareholder approval for charter or bylaw\namendments that would prohibit the removal of directors except for cause, thus ensuring that directors would\nretain their directorship for\ntheir full-term unless found guilty of self-dealing. By requiring cause to be demonstrated through due\nprocess, management insulates the directors from removal even if a director has been performing poorly, not\nattending meetings, or not acting in\nthe best interests of shareholders.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals that provide that directors may be removed only for cause.  \n                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals which seek to restore the authority of shareholders to remove directors with or   \n       without cause.                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals that provide only continuing directors may elect replacements to fill board   \n       vacancies.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals that permit shareholders to elect directors to fill board vacancies.  \n                                                                                                \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Proposals\nto fix the size of the board at a specific number can prevent management from increasing the board size\nwithout shareholder approval when facing a proxy context. By increasing the size of the board, management\ncan make it more difficult for\ndissidents to gain control of the board. Fixing the size of the board also prevents a reduction in the size\nof the board as a strategy to oust independent directors.

As a result, shareholders can be pressured to vote with\nmanagement at companies with which they maintain or would like to establish a business relationship.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals that request corporations to adopt confidential voting, the use of    \n       independent tabulators,                                                                              \n       and the use of independent inspectors for an election as long as the proposals include clauses for   \n  \u00a7    proxy contests. In the case of a contested election, management is permitted to request that the     \n       dissident group honor its confidential voting policy.                                                \n       If the dissidents agree, the policy remains in place. If the dissidents do not agree, the            \n       confidential voting policy is waived.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                               \n  \u00a7    Vote for management proposals to adopt confidential voting procedures.  \n                                                                               \nShareholder Ability to Call Special Meetings\n\nMost state corporation statutes allow shareholders to call a special meeting when they want to take action\non certain matters that arise between regularly scheduled\nannual meetings. Sometimes this right applies only if a shareholder or a group of shareholders own a\nspecified percentage of shares, with ten percent being the most common. Shareholders may lose the ability to\nremove directors, initiate a\nshareholder resolution, or respond to a beneficial offer without having to wait for the next scheduled\nmeeting if they are unable to act at a special meeting of their own calling.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to call special meetings.  \n                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Generally vote for proposals that remove restrictions on the right of shareholders to act            \n       independently of management.                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Vote against provisions that would require advance notice of more than sixty days.  \n                                                                                           \nShareholder Ability to Act by Written Consent\n\nConsent solicitations allow shareholders to vote on and respond to shareholder and management proposals by\nmail without having to act at a physical meeting. A consent\ncard is sent by mail for shareholder approval and only requires a signature for action. Some corporate\nbylaws require supermajority votes for consents, while at others standard annual meeting rules apply.\nShareholders may lose the ability to remove\ndirectors, initiate a shareholder resolution, or respond to a beneficial offer without having to wait for\nthe next scheduled meeting if they are unable to act by written consent.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to take action by written         \n       consent.                                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Generally vote for proposals to allow or make easier shareholder action by written consent.  \n                                                                                                    \nUnequal Voting Rights\n\nIncumbent managers are able to use unequal voting rights through the creation of a separate class of shares\nthat has superior voting rights to the common shares of\nregular shareholders. This separate class of shares with disproportionate voting power allows management to\nconcentrate its power and insulate itself from the wishes of the majority of\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Dual class exchange offers involve a transfer\nof voting rights from one group of shareholders to another group of shareholders typically through the\npayment of a preferential dividend. A dual class recapitalization plan also establishes two classes of\ncommon stock with unequal voting rights,\nbut initially involves an equal distribution of preferential and inferior voting shares to current\nshareholders.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Vote for resolutions that seek to maintain or convert to a one-share-one-vote capital structure.  \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally vote against requests for the creation or continuation of dual class capital structures    \n  \u00a7    or the creation of new                                                                               \n       or additional super-voting shares.                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nSupermajority Shareholder Vote Requirement to Amend the Charter or Bylaws\n\nSupermajority shareholder vote requirements for charter or bylaw amendments are often the result of \u0093lock-\nin\u0094 votes,\nwhich are the votes required to repeal new provisions to the corporate charter. Supermajority provisions\nviolate the principle that a simple majority of voting shares should be all that is necessary to effect\nchange regarding a company and its\ncorporate governance provisions. Requiring more than this may entrench managers by blocking actions that are\nin the best interests of shareholders.\n\nThe general\nlack of credit availability for financially distressed companies has resulted in \u0093rescue\u0094 or highly dilutive\nstock and warrant issuances, which often comprise a majority of the company\u0092s voting stock upon conversion.\nWhen an investor\ntakes control of the company through the conversion of securities, the new owners often seek statutory\namendments, such as adopting written consent, or allowing 50 percent shareholders to call a special meeting,\nthat allow effective control over the\ncompany with little or no input from minority shareholders.\n\nIn such cases, the existing supermajority vote requirements would serve to protect minority\nshareholders\u0092 interests. The reduction in the vote requirements, when coupled with low quorum requirements\n(in Nevada and other states) could shift the balance in power away from small shareholders while overly\nempowering large shareholders.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote against management proposals to require a supermajority shareholder vote to approve charter     \n       and bylaw amendments.                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote against management proposals seeking to lower supermajority shareholder vote requirements when  \n  \u00a7    they accompany                                                                                       \n       management sponsored proposals to also change certain charter or bylaw amendments.                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for management or shareholder proposals to reduce supermajority vote requirements for charter   \n       and bylaw amendments.                                                                                \n  \u00a7    However, for companies with shareholders who have significant ownership levels, vote on a            \n       case-by-case basis, taking into account 1) ownership structure, 2) quorum requirements, and 3)       \n       supermajority vote requirements.                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nManagement Proposals to Ratify Existing Charter or Bylaw Provisions\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n\nGenerally vote against management proposals to ratify provisions of the company\u0092s existing charter or\nbylaws, unless these governance provisions align with best\npractice.\n\nIn addition, voting against or withhold from individual directors, members of the governance committee, or\nthe full board may be warranted,\nconsidering:\n                                                                                             \n  \u00a7    The presence of a shareholder proposal addressing the same issue on the same ballot;  \n                                                                                             \n                                                       \n  \u00a7    The board\u0092s rationale for seeking ratification;  \n                                                       \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Firms have also argued that making Delaware the sole forum for\nlawsuits avoids the possibility\nof duplicative suits arising out of the same events. A number of shareholder advocates have, however,\ncountered that exclusive venue provisions deprive shareholders of the flexibility to choose the forum in\nwhich to assert claims of wrongdoing.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote against management proposals to restrict the\nvenue for shareholder claims by adopting charter or bylaw provisions that seek to establish an exclusive\njudicial forum.\n\nFee-Shifting Bylaws\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote against bylaws that mandate fee-shifting\nwhenever plaintiffs are not completely successful on the merits (i.e., in cases where the plaintiffs are\npartially successful).\n\nBundled Proposals\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on bundled or conditional proxy proposals.

Mergers & Acquisitions / Corporate Restructurings\n\nA number of academic and industry studies have estimated that nearly three quarters of all corporate\nacquisitions fail to create economically meaningful shareholder\nvalue. These studies have also demonstrated that the larger the deal the greater the risk in realizing long-\nterm value for shareholders of the acquiring firm. These risks include integration challenges, over-\nestimation of expected synergies,\nincompatible corporate cultures and poor succession planning. Indeed, some studies have found that smaller\ndeals within specialized industries on average outperform \u0093big bet\u0094 larger deals by a statistically\nsignificant factor.\n\nIn analyzing M&A deals, private placements or other transactional related items on proxy, Public Fund\nAdvisory Services performs a well-rounded analysis that\nseeks to balance all facets of the deal to ascertain whether the proposed acquisition is truly going to\ngenerate long-term value for shareholders and enhance the prospects of the ongoing corporation.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Votes on mergers and acquisitions are always considered on a\ncase-by-case basis, taking into account the following factors:\n                                                   \n  \u00a7    Impact of the merger on shareholder value;  \n                                                   \n                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Perspective of ownership (target vs. acquirer) in the deal;  \n                                                                    \n                                                                \n  \u00a7    Form and mix of payment (i.e. stock, cash, debt, etc.);  \n                                                                \n                                                   \n  \u00a7    Fundamental value drivers behind the deal;  \n                                                   \n                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Anticipated financial and operating benefits realizable through combined synergies;  \n                                                                                            \n                                        \n  \u00a7    Offer price (cost vs. premium);  \n                                        \n                                                          \n  \u00a7    Change-in-control payments to executive officers;  \n                                                          \n                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Financial viability of the combined companies as a single entity;  \n                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n       Was the deal put together in good faith?

At the same\ntime, the acquirer states that once control has been obtained, the target\u0092s remaining shares will be\npurchased with cash, cash and\nsecurities, or only securities. Since the payment offered for the remaining stock is, by design, less\nvaluable than the original offer for the controlling shares, shareholders are forced to sell out early to\nmaximize the value of their shares.\nStandard fair price provisions require that in the absence of board or shareholder approval of the\nacquisition the bidder must pay the remaining shareholders the same price for their shares that brought\ncontrol.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for fair price proposals as long as the shareholder vote requirement embedded in the provision  \n  \u00a7    is no more than a                                                                                    \n       majority of disinterested shares.                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to lower the shareholder vote requirement in existing fair price      \n       provisions.                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

While the number of bankruptcies has risen as evidenced by many firms, including General Motors\nand Lehman Brothers, the prevalence of these reorganizations can vary year over year due to, among other\nthings, market conditions and a\ncompany\u0092s ability to sustain its operations. Additionally, the amount of time that lapses between a\nparticular company\u0092s entrance into Chapter 11 and its submission of a plan of reorganization varies\nsignificantly depending on the\ncomplexity, timing, and jurisdiction of the particular case. These plans are often put to a vote of\nshareholders (in addition to other interested parties), as required by the Bankruptcy Code.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on proposals to common shareholders on\nbankruptcy plans of reorganization, considering the following factors including, but not limited to:\n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Estimated value and financial prospects of the reorganized company;  \n                                                                            \n                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Percentage ownership of current shareholders in the reorganized company;  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n       Whether shareholders are adequately represented in the reorganization process (particularly through  \n  \u00a7    the existence of an                                                                                  \n       Official Equity Committee);                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The cause(s) of the bankruptcy filing, and the extent to which the plan of reorganization addresses  \n       the cause(s);                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                               \n  \u00a7    Existence of a superior alternative to the plan of reorganization; and  \n                                                                               \n                                               \n  \u00a7    Governance of the reorganized company.  \n                                               \nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Corporations (SPACs)\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on SPAC mergers and acquisitions taking into\naccount the following:\n                                                                                                            \n       Valuation - Is the value being paid by the SPAC reasonable?

Capital Structure\n\nThe management of a corporation\u0092s capital structure involves a number of important issues including dividend\npolicy, types of\nassets, opportunities for growth, ability to finance new projects internally, and the cost of obtaining\nadditional capital. Many financing decisions have a significant impact on shareholder value, particularly\nwhen they involve the issuance of\nadditional common stock, preferred stock, or debt.\n\nCommon Stock Authorization\n\nState statutes and stock exchanges require shareholder approval for increases in the number of common\nshares. Corporations increase their supply of common stock for a\nvariety of ordinary business purposes: raising new capital, funding stock compensation programs, business\nacquisitions, implementation of stock splits, or payment of stock dividends.\n\nClear justification should accompany all management requests for shareholder approval of increases in\nauthorized common stock. Public Fund Advisory Services supports\nincreases in authorized common stock to fund stock splits that are in shareholders\u0092 interests.

Stock splits/dividends do not affect\nthe equity of the company. An understanding of forward and reverse stock splits and stock dividends is\nrelevant because proposals to\nincrease authorized common shares may be tied to the implementation of a planned stock distribution.\n\nShareholders can effectively cancel a split or dividend if\nthe company does not have sufficient shares to implement a split without an increase in authorized shares.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for management proposals to increase the common\nshare authorization for stock split or stock dividend, provided that the increase in authorized shares is\nreasonable in accordance with Public Fund Advisory Services\u0092 Common Stock Authorization policy.\n\nReverse Stock Splits\n\nReverse splits exchange multiple shares for a lesser amount to increase share price. Increasing share price\nis sometimes necessary to restore a company\u0092s share\nprice to a level that will allow it to be traded on the national stock exchanges. In addition, some\nbrokerage houses have a policy of not monitoring or investing in very low priced shares. Reverse stock\nsplits can help maintain stock liquidity.\n\nEvaluation of management proposals to implement a reverse stock split will take into account whether there\nis a corresponding proportional decrease in authorized\nshares. Without a corresponding decrease, a reverse stock split is effectively an increase in authorized\nshares by way of reducing the number of shares outstanding, while leaving the number of authorized shares to\nbe issued at the pre-split level.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for management proposals to implement a reverse stock\nsplit if:\n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The number of authorized shares will be proportionately reduced; or  \n                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The effective increase in authorized shares is equal to or less than the company\u0092s existing           \n       authorization.                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nVote case-by-case on proposals that do not meet either of the above conditions, taking into consideration\nthe following factors:\n                                                                                \n  \u00a7    Stock exchange notification to the company of a potential delisting; or  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n       Disclosure of substantial doubt about the company\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern without    \n  \u00a7    additional                                                                                           \n       financing;                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                   \n  \u00a7    The company\u0092s rationale; or  \n                                   \n                                     \n  \u00a7    Other factors as applicable.  \n                                     \nShareholders should only vote for non-proportionate reverse stock splits in the most dire of situations.\nCompanies should provide disclosure of external evidence that\na potential delisting is imminent to separate the true emergencies from vague potential risks to\nshareholders.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The purpose of\npar value stock is to establish the maximum responsibility\nof a stockholder in the event that a corporation becomes insolvent.

The absence of these rights could cause stockholders\u0092 interest in a company to be reduced by the\nsale of additional shares without\ntheir knowledge and at prices unfavorable to them. Preemptive rights, however, can make it difficult for\ncorporations to issue large blocks of stock for general corporate purposes.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The burden of proof will be on the company to establish that it has a need for the higher limit.\n\nRenewal of such mandates should be sought at each year\u0092s annual meeting.\n\nVote case-by-case on share issuances for a specific transaction or financing proposal.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

State of Incorporation\n\nVoting on State Takeover Statutes\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Review on a case-by-case basis proposals to opt in or out of\nstate takeover statutes (including control share acquisition statutes, control share cash-out statutes,\nfreeze out provisions, fair price provisions, stakeholder laws, poison pill endorsements, severance pay and\nlabor contract provisions, anti-greenmail provisions, and disgorgement provisions). Public Fund Advisory\nServices generally supports opting into stakeholder protection statutes if they provide comprehensive\nprotections for employees and community stakeholders. Public Fund Advisory Services is less supportive of\ntakeover statutes that only serve to protect incumbent management from accountability to shareholders and\nwhich negatively influence shareholder value.\n\nReincorporation Proposals\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Management or shareholder proposals to change a company\u0092s state\nof incorporation should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, giving consideration to both financial and\ncorporate governance concerns including the following:\n                                     \n  \u00a7    Reasons for reincorporation;  \n                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Comparison of company\u0092s governance practices and provisions prior to and following the                \n       reincorporation; and                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                \n  \u00a7    Comparison of corporation laws of original state and destination state.  \n                                                                                \nVote for reincorporation when the economic factors outweigh any neutral or negative governance changes.\n\nOffshore Reincorporations and Tax Havens\n\nFor a company that seeks to reincorporate, Public Fund Advisory Services evaluates the merits of the move on\na case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the\ncompany\u0092s strategic rationale for the move, the potential economic ramifications, potential tax benefits,\nand any corporate governance changes that may impact shareholders. Public Fund Advisory Services believes\nthere are a number of concerns\nassociated with a company looking to reincorporate from the United States to offshore locales such as\nBermuda, the Cayman Islands or Panama. With more U.S.-listed companies seeking to move offshore,\nshareholders are beginning to understand the web\nof complexities surrounding the legal, tax, and governance implications involved in such a transaction. .\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Vote case-by-case on proposed offshore moves, taking into consideration:  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n       Legal recourse for U.S. stockholders of the new company and the enforcement of legal judgments       \n  \u00a7    against the company under                                                                            \n       the U.S. securities laws;                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The transparency (or lack thereof) of the new locale\u0092s legal system;  \n                                                                            \n                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Adoption of any shareholder-unfriendly corporate law provisions;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Actual, quantifiable tax benefits associated with foreign incorporation;  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Potential for accounting manipulations and/or discrepancies;  \n                                                                     \n                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Any pending U.S. legislation concerning offshore companies;  \n                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n       Prospects of reputational harm and potential damage to brand name via increased media coverage       \n  \u00a7    concerning corporate                                                                                 \n       expatriation.                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally vote for shareholder requests calling for \u0093expatriate\u0094 companies that are domiciled abroad   \n  \u00a7    yet                                                                                                  \n       predominantly owned and operated in America to re-domesticate back to a U.S. state jurisdiction.     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

U.S. policies will also apply to\ncompanies listed on U.S. exchanges as Foreign Private Issuers (FPIs) and that may be exempt from the\ndisclosure and corporate governance\nrequirements that apply to most companies traded on U.S. exchanges, including a number of SEC rules and\nstock market listing requirements.

Corporate Responsibility & Accountability\n\nSocial, Environmental and Sustainability Issues\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services generally supports social, workforce, and environmental shareholder-sponsored\nresolutions if they seek to create responsible corporate\ncitizens while at the same time attempting to enhance long-term shareholder value. Public Fund Advisory\nServices typically supports proposals that ask for disclosure reporting of information that is not available\noutside the company that is not\nproprietary in nature. Such reporting is particularly most vital when it appears that a company has not\nadequately addressed shareholder concerns regarding social, workplace, environmental and/or other issues. A\ndetermination whether the request is\nrelevant to the company\u0092s core business and in-line with industry practice will be made on a case-by-case\nbasis.

In order to be able to intelligently monitor their investments, shareholders\noften need information that is best provided by the company in which they have invested on behalf of their\nend beneficiaries. Qualified\nrequests satisfying the aforementioned criteria usually merit support.\n\nProposals requesting that the company cease certain actions that the proponent believes\nare harmful to society or some segment of society will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Special\nattention will be made to the company\u0092s legal and ethical obligations, its ability to remain profitable, and\npotential negative publicity if\nthe company fails to honor the request. A high standard will need to be met by proponents requesting\nspecific action like divesture of a business line or operation, legal remuneration, or withdrawal from\ncertain high-risk markets.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

GENERAL CSR RELATED\n\nSpecial Policy Review and Shareholder Advisory Committees\n\nThese resolutions propose the establishment of special committees of the board to address broad corporate\npolicy and provide forums for ongoing dialogue on issues\nincluding, but not limited to: shareholder relations, the environment, occupational health and safety, and\nexecutive compensation.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Support these proposals when they appear to offer a potentially\neffective method for enhancing shareholder value.\n                                                                                                            \n   International Operations                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nThe rise of globalization has put increasing importance on the need for U.S. companies to periodically\nmonitor their business operations abroad. As a means to\npreserve brand integrity and protect against potentially costly litigation and negative public relations,\nPublic Fund Advisory Services generally supports shareholder proposals which call for a report on the\ncompany\u0092s core business policies and\nprocedures of its operations outside the United States.\n\nMany of the resolutions which address a company\u0092s international policies can include: impact of\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI) in emerging market economies; corporate safeguards against money laundering;\nterrorist financing; economic de-stabilization concerns; relationships with international financial\ninstitutions (IFIs); and product\nsales/marketing abroad (i.e., tobacco, pharmaceutical drug pricing).\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally support proposals asking for policy clarification and\nreporting on international operations that can materially impact the company\u0092s short and long-term bottom-\nline.\n\nAffirm Political Non-Partisanship\n\nEmployees should not be put in a position where professional standing and goodwill within the corporation\ncould be jeopardized as a result of political beliefs.\nResponsible employment practices should protect workers from an environment characterized by political\nindoctrination or intimidation. Corporations should not devote resources to partisan political activities,\nnor should they compel their employees\nto contribute to or support particular causes. Moreover, it is wise for a corporation to maintain a\npolitically neutral stance as to avoid potentially embarrassing conflicts of interests that could negatively\nimpact the company\u0092s brand name\nwith consumers.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally support proposals affirming political non-\npartisanship within the company.\n\nPolitical Contributions, Lobbying Reporting & Disclosure\n\nChanges in legislation that governs corporate political giving have, rather than limiting such\ncontributions, increased the complexity of tracking how much money corporations contribute to the political\nprocess and where that money ultimately ends up. In January 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court\u0092s decision in\nCitizens United vs. Federal Election Commission lifted restrictions on corporate spending in federal\nelections. A company\u0092s involvement in the political process could impact shareholder value if such\nactivities are not properly overseen and managed.\n\nShareholders have the right to know about corporate political activities, and management\u0092s knowledge that\nsuch information can be made publicly available should\nencourage a company\u0092s lawful and responsible use of political contributions.\n                                                                \n  W W W . I S S G O V E R N A N C E .

Given the significant reputational and financial risk involved in political giving, shareholders\nshould expect management to have\nthe necessary capabilities to monitor and track all monies distributed toward political groups and causes.\nThese internal controls should be fully consistent with Section 404 requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nof 2002.\n\nWhile political contributions, lobbying and other corporate political activity can benefit the strategic\ninterests of a company, it is important that accountability\nmechanisms are in place to ensure that monies disbursed in support of political objectives actually generate\nidentifiable returns on shareholder wealth. Such mechanisms serve to insure against the use of shareholder\nfunds in the furtherance of\nnarrow management agendas.\n\nWhen analyzing the proposals, special consideration will be made if the target company has been the subject\nof significant controversy\nstemming from its contributions or political activities, if the company fails to disclose a policy to\nshareholders that outlines the process by which the company considers its political contributions and\nlobbying activities, or if the company has\nrecently been involved in significant controversy or litigation related to the company\u0092s political\ncontributions or governmental affairs.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n

ENVIRONMENT & CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nShareholder proposals addressing environmental and energy concerns\nhave been plentiful in recent years, and generally seek greater disclosure on an issue or seek to improve a\ncompany\u0092s environmental practices in order to protect the world\u0092s natural resources. In addition, some\nproponents cite the negative\nfinancial implications for companies with poor environmental practices, including liabilities associated\nwith site clean-ups and lawsuits, as well as arguments that energy efficient products and clean\nenvironmental practices are sustainable business\npractices that will contribute to long-term shareholder value. Shareholders say the majority of independent\natmospheric scientists agree that global warming poses a serious problem to the health and welfare of all\ncountries, citing the findings of\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world\u0092s most authoritative scientific body on the\nsubject. Shareholder proponents argue that companies can report on their greenhouse gas emissions within a\nfew months at reasonable\ncost.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nScientists generally agree that gases released by chemical reactions including the burning of fossil fuels\ncontribute to a \u0093greenhouse effect\u0094 that traps\nthe planet\u0092s heat. Environmentalists claim that the greenhouse gases produced by the industrial age have\ncaused recent weather crises such as heat waves, rainstorms, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and\nreceding coastlines. With notable\nexceptions, a number of business leaders have described the rise and fall of global temperatures as\nnaturally occurring phenomena and depicted corporate impact on climate change as minimal.\n\nShareholder proposals asking a company to issue a report to shareholders \u0096 at reasonable cost and omitting\nproprietary information \u0096 on greenhouse gas\nemissions ask that the report include descriptions of efforts within companies to reduce emissions, their\nfinancial exposure and potential liability from operations that contribute to global warming, and their\ndirect or indirect efforts to promote\nthe view that global warming is not a threat. Proponents argue that there is scientific proof that the\nburning of fossil fuels causes global warming, that future legislation may make companies financially liable\nfor their contributions to global\nwarming, changing market dynamics and consumer preferences may impact demand for fossil fuels, and thus\nshareholder value, and that a report on the company\u0092s role in global warming can be assembled at reasonable\ncost.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Generally vote for shareholder proposals calling for a company to commit to reducing its greenhouse  \n  \u00a7    gas emissions under a                                                                                \n       reasonable timeline.                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally vote for resolutions requesting that a company disclose information on the financial,      \n  \u00a7    physical, or regulatory                                                                              \n       risks related to climate change on its operations and investments, or on how the company             \n       identifies, measures, and manages such risks.                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nGenerally vote for proposals requesting a report on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from company operations\nand/or products and operations.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Increased use of renewable energy is expected to reduce the negative environmental\nimpact of energy companies. In addition, as supplies of oil and coal exist in the earth in limited\nquantities, renewable energy sources\nrepresent a competitive, and some would even argue essential, long-term business strategy.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally support shareholder proposals seeking increased\ninvestment in renewable energy sources, taking into account whether the terms of the resolution are\nrealistic or overly restrictive for management to pursue.\n\n16 Variations of this request also include climate\ntransition related ambitions, or commitment to reporting on the implementation of a climate plan.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Indeed, the term sustainability is complex and poses significant challenges for companies\non many levels. Many in the investment community have termed this broader responsibility the \u0093triple bottom\nline,\u0094 referring to the\ntriad of performance goals related to economic prosperity, social responsibility and environmental quality.\nIn essence, the concept requires companies to balance the needs and interests of their various stakeholders\nwhile operating in a manner that\nsustains business growth for the long-term, supports local communities and protects the environment and\nnatural capital for future generations.\n\nReporting and\nenhanced disclosure addressing sustainable development is important to companies namely because it offers a\nformal structure for decision making that helps management teams anticipate and address important global\ntrends that can have serious\nconsequences for business and society. Shareholders may request general sustainability reports on a specific\nlocation or operation, often requesting that the company detail the environmental, social, legal and other\nrisks and/or potential\nliabilities of the specific project in question.\n\nA number of companies have begun to report on sustainability issues using established standards in the\nmarketplace. Such reporting focuses on corporate compliance and measurement regarding key economic,\nenvironmental, and social performance indicators. As a best practice, companies release annual\nsustainability reports in conjunction to regular\nannual statement of operations.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally support shareholder proposals seeking greater\ndisclosure on the company\u0092s environmental and social practices, and/or associated risks and liabilities.\n                                                                                                            \n   Operations in Protected or Sensitive Areas                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nOperating in regions protected or established under national or international categorization guidelines,\nincluding wildlife refuges, national forests, and\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) categorized areas, expose\ncompanies to increased oversight and the potential for associated risk and controversy. While it is\nimportant for a company to have the flexibility\nto operate in these regions to take advantage of strategic placement or growth, additional disclosure could\nbe an important mitigating factor to address increased risk and oversight. Restrictions to the company\u0092s\noperations, damaging public\nrelations, and costly litigation resulting from failure to comply with the requirements associated with\nprotected or categorized regions could have a significant impact on shareholder value.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally support shareholder requests for reports outlining\npotential environmental damage from operations in protected regions, including wildlife refuges, unless the\ncompany does not currently have operations or plans to develop operations in these protected regions.\n\nHydraulic Fracturing\n\nShareholder proponents have elevated concerns on the use of hydraulic fracturing, an increasingly\ncontroversial process in which water, sand, and a mix of chemicals\nis blasted horizontally into tight layers of shale rock to extract natural gas. As this practice has gained\nmore widespread use, environmentalists have raised concerns that the chemicals mixed with sand and water to\naid the fracturing process can\ncontaminate ground water supplies. Proponents of resolutions at companies that employ hydraulic fracturing\nare also concerned that wastewater produced by the process could overload the waste treatment plants to\nwhich it is shipped. Shareholders have\nasked companies that utilize hydraulic fracturing to report on the environmental impact of the practice and\nto disclose policies designed to reduce hazards from the process.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for requests seeking greater transparency on the practice\nof hydraulic fracturing and its associated risks.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The Ceres\nRoadmap 2030, formulated by Ceres (formerly known as the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible\nEconomies, CERES), require signing companies to address environmental issues, including protection of the\nbiosphere, sustainable use of natural\nresources, reduction and disposal of wastes, energy conservation, and employee and community risk reduction.\nA signatory to the Ceres Roadmap 2030 would disclose its efforts in such areas through a standardized report\nsubmitted to Ceres and made\navailable to the public.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services supports proposals that improve a company\u0092s public image, reduce exposure to\nliabilities, and\nestablish standards so that environmentally responsible companies and markets are not at a competitive\nfinancial disadvantage.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Vote for requests asking a company to formally adopt the Ceres Roadmap 2030.  \n                                                                                     \n                                                                              \n  \u00a7    Vote for adoption of reports to shareholders on environmental issues.  \n                                                                              \nLand Use\n\nMany\nlarge retail stores and real estate development firms have received criticism over their policies and\nprocesses for acquiring and developing land. Often, in such cases, there are organizations that support as\nwell as those that oppose the proposed\ndevelopment.\n\nMany of these requests brought forth by the respective stakeholders raise serious issues that can have a\nreal impact on short-term shareholder\nvalue. However in some cases, additional reporting may be duplicative of existing disclosure or may fail to\nprovide added benefit to shareholders commensurate with the associated cost or burden of providing\nadditional information. Some of the\ncompanies targeted with such resolutions have been subject to recent litigation, significant fines stemming\nfrom their land use practices, and/or recent community boycotts.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally support shareholder resolutions that request better\ndisclosure of detailed information on a company\u0092s policies related to land use or development or compliance\nwith local and national laws and zoning requirements.\n\nWater Use\n\nShareholders may ask for a company to prepare a report evaluating the business risks linked to water use and\nimpacts on the company\u0092s supply chain, including\nsubsidiaries and bottling partners. Such proposals also ask companies to disclose current policies and\nprocedures for mitigating the impact of operations on local communities in areas of water scarcity.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals seeking the preparation of a\nreport on a company\u0092s risks linked to water use.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

WORKPLACE PRACTICES & HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity\n\nThese proposals generally request that a company establish a policy of reporting to shareholders its\nprogress with equal opportunity and affirmative action programs.\nThe costs of violating federal laws that prohibit discrimination by corporations are high and can affect\ncorporate earnings.\n\nThe Equal Opportunities Employment\nCommission (EEOC) does not release the company\u0092s filings to the public unless it is involved in litigation,\nand it is difficult to obtain from other sources. Companies need to be sensitive to minority employment\nissues as the work force becomes\nincreasingly diverse. This information can be provided with little cost to the company and does not create\nan unreasonable burden on management.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals calling for action on equal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination.  \n                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for proposals requesting legal and regulatory compliance and public reporting related to        \n  \u00a7    non-discrimination,                                                                                  \n       affirmative action, workplace health and safety, environmental issues, and labor policies and        \n       practices that affect long-term corporate performance.                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals advocating for non-discrimination in salary, wages, and all benefits.  \n                                                                                                 \nHigh-Performance Workplace\n\nHigh-performance workplace practices emphasize employee training, participation, and feedback. The concept\nof a high-performance workplace has been endorsed by the\nU.S. Department of Labor and refers to a workplace that is designed to provide workers with the information,\nskills, incentives, and responsibility to make decisions essential for innovation, quality improvement and\nrapid response to changes in the\nmarketplace. These standards embrace a \u0093what is good for the worker is good for the company\u0094 philosophy.\nStudies have shown that improvement in human resources practices is associated with increases in total\nreturn to shareholders.\nHigh-performance workplace standards proposals can include linking compensation to social measures such as\nemployee training, morale and safety, environmental performance and workplace lawsuits.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally support proposals that incorporate high-performance\nworkplace standards.\n\nWorkplace Safety\n\nIn light of fatal accidents at oil refineries (Tesoro \u0096 Anacortes refinery, April 2010; and BP \u0096 Texas City\nrefinery, March 2005), the 2010 BP Deepwater\nHorizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico, and the explosion at Massey Energy\u0092s Upper Big Branch mine in 2010,\nshareholders have sought greater transparency and accountability regarding workplace safety by filing\nresolutions at a number of\ncorporations.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for shareholder proposals requesting requests\nfor workplace safety reports, including reports on accident risk reduction efforts.\n                                                                \n  W W W . I S S G O V E R N A N C E . C O    F-135    66\u00a0of\u00a073  \n  M                                                             \n                                                                \nNon-Discrimination in Retirement Benefits\n\nA cash balance plan is a defined benefit plan that treats an earned retirement benefit as if it were a\ncredit from a defined contribution plan, but which provides a\nstated benefit at the end of its term. Because employer contributions to these plans are credited evenly\nover the life of a plan and not based on a seniority formula, they may reduce payouts to long-term employees\nwho are currently vested in plans.\n\nCash-balance pension conversions have undergone significant congressional and federal agency scrutiny in the\nwake of high-profile EEOC complaints on age\ndiscrimination and employee anger at several large blue-chip companies. While significant policy reform is\nunlikely in the short-term, business interests are worried enough that the National Association of\nManufacturers and other pro-business\nlobbies have formed a coalition on Capitol Hill to preserve the essential features of the plans and to\noverturn an IRS ruling.\n\nDriving the push behind\nconversions from traditional pension plans to cash-balance plans are the substantial savings that companies\ngenerate in the process. Critics point out that this savings is gained at the expense of the most senior\nemployees.

These\npredatory practices include: lending to borrowers with inadequate income, who will then default; not\nreporting on payment performances of borrowers to credit agencies; implying that credit life insurance is\nnecessary to obtain the loan (packing);\nunnecessarily high fees; refinancing with high additional fees rather than working out a loan that is in\narrears (flipping); and high pre-payment fees.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                              \n  \u00a7    Support proposals calling for full compliance with fair-lending laws.  \n                                                                              \n                                                                \n  \u00a7    Support reporting on overall lending policies and data.  \n                                                                \nMacBride Principles\n\nThese resolutions have called for the adoption of the MacBride Principles for operations located in Northern\nIreland. They request companies operating abroad to\nsupport the equal employment opportunity policies that apply in facilities they operate domestically. The\nprinciples were established to address the sectarian hiring problems between Protestants and Catholics in\nNorthern Ireland. It is well\ndocumented that Northern Ireland\u0092s Catholic community faced much higher unemployment figures than the\nProtestant community. In response to this problem, the U.K. government instituted the New Fair Employment\nAct of 1989 (and subsequent\namendments) to address the sectarian hiring problems.\n\nMany companies believe that the Act adequately addresses the problems and that further action, including\nadoption of the MacBride Principles, only duplicates the efforts already underway. In evaluating a proposal\nto adopt the MacBride Principles, shareholders must decide whether the principles will cause companies to\ndivest, and therefore worsen the\nunemployment problem, or whether the principles will promote equal hiring practices. Proponents believe that\nthe Fair Employment Act does not sufficiently address the sectarian hiring problems.

These conditions include the use of slave, child,\nor prison labor, undemocratically elected governments, widespread reports by human rights advocates, fervent\npro-democracy protests, or\neconomic sanctions and boycotts.\n\nMany proposals refer to the seven core conventions, commonly referred to as the \u0093Declaration on Fundamental\nPrinciples and\nRights At Work,\u0094 ratified by the International Labor Organization (ILO). The seven conventions fall under\nfour broad categories: i) right to organize and bargain collectively; ii) non-discrimination in employment;\niii) abolition of forced\nlabor; and iv) end of child labor. Each member nation of the ILO body is bound to respect and promote these\nrights to the best of their abilities.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Support the principles and codes of conduct relating to company investment and/or operations in      \n  \u00a7    countries with patterns                                                                              \n       of human rights abuses or pertaining to geographic regions experiencing political turmoil (Northern  \n       Ireland, Columbia, Burma, former Soviet Union, and China).                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Support the implementation and reporting on ILO codes of conduct.  \n                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n       Support independent monitoring programs in conjunction with local and respected religious and human  \n  \u00a7    rights groups to                                                                                     \n       monitor supplier and licensee compliance with Codes.                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Support requests that a company conduct an assessment of the human rights risks in its operation or  \n  \u00a7    in its supply chain,                                                                                 \n       or report on its human rights risk assessment process.                                               \n                                                                                                            \nIV.

Current reporting requirements for companies that operate nuclear facilities are\nmanaged by the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission (NRC) and include detailed reports on safety and security that are available to the public.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally support shareholder resolutions requesting that\ncompanies report on risks associated with their nuclear reactor designs and/or the production and interim\nstorage of irradiated fuel rods.\n                                                                                                            \n   Concentrated Area Feeding Operations (CAFOs)                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nThe level of pollution resulting from CAFOs has drawn increased attention in recent years as certain legal\ndecisions have established the precedent that a company can\nbe held liable for the actions of the contract farms it sources from. Fines and remediation expenses\nstemming from these cases have been significant and could have a notable impact on the companies\u0092 operations\nand shareholder value.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally support resolutions requesting that companies report\nto shareholders on the risks and liabilities associated with concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs)\nunless the company has publicly disclosed guidelines for its corporate and contract farming operations\n(including compliance monitoring), or if the company does not directly source from CAFOs.\n\nPharmaceutical Product Reimportation\n\nOne of the most visible aspects of the legal and political debate over rising health care costs in the\nUnited States can be seen through prescription drug\nreimportation through Canada. While U.S. and Canadian regulations limit reimportation, several states have\ntaken steps to encourage employees to actively seek less expensive medications through reimportation.\n\nShareholder action at major pharmaceutical companies has hinged around requesting increased disclosure of\nthe financial and legal risks associated with company\npolicies, or called on companies to change distribution limits to increase product availability in Canada,\nthereby encouraging product reimportation to the United States. The level of public concern over this issue\nand associated impact that a\npoorly developed policy could have on the companies suggest that additional disclosure of company policies\nrelated to reimportation could be beneficial to shareholders and generally merits support.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Generally support shareholder proposals requesting that companies report on the financial and legal  \n  \u00a7    impact of their                                                                                      \n       policies regarding prescription drug reimportation, unless such information is already publicly      \n       disclosed.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally support shareholder proposals requesting that companies adopt specific policies to         \n  \u00a7    encourage or not constrain                                                                           \n       prescription drug reimportation.                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nPharmaceutical Product Pricing\n\nPharmaceutical drug pricing, both within the United States and internationally, has raised many questions of\nthe companies that are responsible for creating and\nmarketing these treatments. Shareholder proponents, activists and even some legislators have called upon\ndrug companies to restrain pricing of prescription drugs.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Seniors have the greatest need for prescription drugs, accounting for a\nsignificant portion of all prescription drug sales, but they often live on fixed incomes and are\nunderinsured.\n\nProponents note that efforts to reign-in pharmaceutical costs will not negatively impact research and\ndevelopment (R&D) costs and that retail drug prices are\nconsistently higher in the U.S. than in other industrialized nations. Pharmaceutical companies often respond\nthat adopting a formal drug pricing policy could put the company at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the AIDS crisis in Africa, many shareholders have called on companies to address the\nissue of affordable drugs for the treatment of AIDS, as\nwell as TB and Malaria throughout the developing world. When analyzing such resolutions, consideration\nshould be made of the strategic implications of pricing policies in the market.\n\nPublic Fund Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Proposals asking a company to implement price restraints on its pharmaceutical products will be      \n  \u00a7    evaluated on a                                                                                       \n       case-by-case basis, taking into account the following factors:                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Whether the proposal focuses on a specific drug and region;  \n                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n       Whether the economic benefits of providing subsidized drugs (e.g., public goodwill) outweigh the     \n  \u00a7    costs in terms of                                                                                    \n       reduced profits, lower R&D spending, and harm to competitiveness;                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       The extent that reduced prices can be offset through the company\u0092s marketing expenditures without     \n  \u00a7    significantly                                                                                        \n       impacting R&D spending;                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Whether the company already limits price increases of its products;  \n                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Whether the company already contributes life-saving pharmaceuticals to the needy and Third World     \n       countries; and                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                       \n  \u00a7    The extent to which peer companies implement price restraints.  \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally support proposals requesting that companies implement specific price restraints for its    \n  \u00a7    pharmaceutical products                                                                              \n       in developing markets or targeting certain population groups.                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally support proposals requesting that companies evaluate their global product pricing          \n  \u00a7    strategy, considering the                                                                            \n       existing level of disclosure on pricing policies, any deviation from established industry pricing    \n       norms, and the company\u0092s existing philanthropic initiatives.                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals that call on companies to develop a policy to provide affordable      \n  \u00a7    HIV, AIDS, TB and Malaria                                                                            \n       drugs to citizens in the developing world.                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

The U.S.\nDepartment of Labor (DOL) has stated that the fiduciary act of\nmanaging plan assets that are shares of corporate stock includes the voting of proxies appurtenant to those\nshares of stock and that trustees may delegate this duty to an investment manager. ERISA section 3(38)\ndefines an investment manager as any\nfiduciary who is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisor Act of 1940. ISS is a\nregistered investment adviser under the Investment Advisor Act of 1940.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services will vote the proxies of its clients solely in the interest of their\nparticipants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of\nproviding benefits to them. The interests of participants and beneficiaries will not be subordinated to\nunrelated objectives. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services shall act with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence\nunder the circumstances then\nprevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the\nconduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims. When proxies due to Taft-Hartley Advisory\nServices\u0092 clients have not\nbeen received, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services will make reasonable efforts to obtain missing proxies. Taft-\nHartley Advisory Services is not responsible for voting proxies it does not receive.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services shall analyze each proxy on a case-by-case basis, informed by the guidelines\nelaborated below, subject to the requirement that all\nvotes shall be cast solely in the long-term interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plans.\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services does not intend for these guidelines to be exhaustive. Hundreds of issues\nappear on proxy ballots every year, and\nit is neither practical nor productive to fashion voting guidelines and policies which attempt to address\nevery eventuality.

Director Elections\n\nElecting directors is the single most important stock ownership right that shareholders can exercise. By\nelecting directors who share their views, shareholders can\nhelp to define performance standards against which management can be held accountable. Taft-Hartley Advisory\nServices holds directors to a high standard when voting on their election, qualifications, and compensation.\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services\nevaluates directors fairly and objectively, rewarding them for significant contributions and holding them\nultimately accountable to shareholders for corporate performance. Institutional investors should use their\nvoting rights in uncontested\nelections to influence financial performance and corporate strategies for achieving long term shareholder\nvalue.\n\nDirector accountability, independence and\ncompetence have become issues of prime importance to investors given the failings in oversight exposed by\nthe global financial crisis. There is also concern over the environment in the boardrooms of certain\nmarkets, where past failures appear to be\nno impediment to continued or new appointments at major companies and may not be part of the evaluation\nprocess at companies in considering whether an individual is, or continues to be, fit for the role and best\nable to serve shareholders\u0092\ninterests.\n\nVoting on Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections\n\nVotes concerning the entire board of directors and members of key board committees are examined using the\nfollowing factors:\n\nBoard Independence:Without independence from management, the board and/or its committees may be unwilling or\nunable to effectively set company strategy and scrutinize performance or executive compensation.\n\nBoard Competence:Companies should seek a diverse board of directors who can add value to the board through\nspecific skills or expertise and who can devote sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. While\ndirectors should not be constrained by arbitrary limits such as age or term limits, directors who are unable\nto attend board and committee meetings and/or who are overextended (i.e. serving on too many boards) raise\nconcern on the director\u0092s ability to effectively serve in shareholders\u0092 best interests.\n\nBoard Accountability: Practices that promote accountability include: transparency into a company\u0092s\ngovernance practices, annual board elections, and providing shareholders the ability to remove problematic\ndirectors and to vote on takeover defenses or other charter/bylaw amendments. These practices help reduce\nthe opportunity for management entrenchment.\n\nBoard Responsiveness:Directors should be responsive to shareholders, particularly in regard to shareholder\nproposals that receive a majority vote or management proposals that receive low shareholder support, and to\ntender offers where a majority of shares are tendered. Boards should also be sufficiently responsive to high\nwithhold/against votes on directors. Furthermore, shareholders should expect directors to devote sufficient\ntime and resources to oversight of the company.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Votes on individual director nominees are always made on a\ncase-by-case basis. Specific director nominee withhold/against1 votes can be triggered by one or more\nof the following factors:\n\nBoard Independence\n                                                                                                            \n       Lack of a board that is at least two-thirds (67 percent) independent \u0096 i.e. where the composition of  \n  \u00a7    non-independent                                                                                      \n       board members is in excess of 33 percent of the entire board;                                        \n                                                                                                            \n1 In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use\n\u0093Withhold\u0094 as the valid contrary vote option in director elections; companies with a majority vote standard\nuse \u0093Against\u0094. However, it will vary by company and the proxy must be checked to determine the valid\ncontrary vote option\nfor the particular company.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Since executive compensation is so heavily\ncorrelated to the managerial power\nrelationship in the boardroom, the separation of the CEO and chair positions is a critical step in\ncurtailing excessive pay, which ultimately can become a drain on shareholder value.\n\nArguments have been made that a smaller company and its shareholders can benefit from the full-time\nattention of a joint chair and CEO. This may be so in select\ncases, and indeed, using a case-by-case review of circumstances there may be worthy exceptions. But, even in\nthese cases, it is the general view of many institutions that a person should only serve in the position of\njoint CEO and chair on a\ntemporary basis, and that these positions should be separated following their provisional combination.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services strongly believes that the\npotential for conflicts of interest in the board\u0092s supervisory and oversight duties trumps any possible\ncorollary benefits that could ensue from a dual CEO/chair scenario. Instead of having an ingrained quid pro\nquo situation whereby a company\nhas a single leader overseeing both management and the boardroom, Taft-Hartley fiduciaries believe that it\nis the board\u0092s implicit duty to assume an impartial and objective role in overseeing the executive team\u0092s\noverall performance.\nShareholder interests are placed in jeopardy if the CEO of a company is required to report to a board that\nshe/he also chairs.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

This objectivity is obviously compromised when a chair is in charge of\nevaluating her/his own performance or has a past or present affiliation with management. Moreover, the\nunification of chair and CEO poses a\ndirect threat to the smooth functioning of the entire board process since it is the ultimate responsibility\nof the chair to set the agenda, facilitate discussion, and make sure that directors are given complete\naccess to information in order to make\ninformed decisions.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Generally vote against or withhold votes from any non-independent director who serves as board       \n       chair.                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Generally vote against or withhold votes from a CEO who is also serving in the role of chair at the  \n       same company.                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Generally support shareholder proposals calling for the separation of the CEO and chair positions.  \n                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally support shareholder proposals calling for a non-executive director to serve as chair who   \n  \u00a7    is not a former CEO or                                                                               \n       senior-level executive of the company.                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nCompetence\n\nExcessive Directorships\n\nAs new regulations mandate that directors be more engaged and vigilant in protecting shareholder\ninterests or else risk civil and/or criminal sanctions, board members have to devote more time and effort to\ntheir oversight duties. Recent surveys of U.S. directors confirm a desire for limiting board memberships, to\nbetween three and five seats.\nIn view of the increased demands placed on corporate board members, Taft-Hartley fiduciaries believe that\ndirectors who are overextended may be impairing their ability to serve as effective representatives of\nshareholders. Taft-Hartley Advisory\nServices will recommend a vote against or withhold from directors serving on an excessive number of other\nboards, which could compromise their primary duties of care and loyalty.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote against or withhold votes from directors\nserving on an excessive number of boards.

When\nevaluating whether to vote against or withhold votes from director nominees, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services\nwill evaluate underperforming\ncompanies that exhibit sustained poor performance as measured by total returns to shareholders over a one-,\nthree-, and five-year period.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory\nServices views deficient oversight mechanisms and the lack of board accountability to shareholders\nespecially in the context of sustained poor performance, as problematic. As part of the framework for\nassessing director\n\n8 Although all of a CEO\u0092s subsidiary boards with publicly-traded common stock will be counted as separate\nboards, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services will not recommend a\nwithhold/against vote for the CEO of a parent company board or any of the controlled (>50 percent ownership)\nsubsidiaries of that parent, but will do so at subsidiaries that are less than 50 percent controlled and\nboards outside the\nparent/subsidiary relationships.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

A\ngovernance structure that discourages director accountability may lead to board and management entrenchment.\nFor example, the existence of\nseveral anti-takeover provisions* has the cumulative effect of deterring legitimate tender offers, mergers,\nand corporate transactions that may have ultimately proved beneficial to shareholders. When a company\nmaintains entrenchment devices,\nshareholders of poorly performing companies are left with few effective routes to beneficial change.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services will assess the\ncompany\u0092s response to the ongoing performance issues, and consider recent board and management changes,\nboard independence, overall governance practices, and other factors that may have an impact on shareholders.\nIf a company exhibits sustained\npoor performance coupled with a lack of board accountability and oversight, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services\u0092\nevaluation may also consider the company\u0092s operational metrics and other factors as warranted.\n\n*Problematic provisions include but are not limited to:\n                                      \n  \u00a7    A classified board structure;  \n                                      \n                                          \n  \u00a7    A supermajority vote requirement;  \n                                          \n                                                                                                            \n       Either a plurality vote standard in uncontested director elections or a majority vote standard with  \n  \u00a7    no plurality                                                                                         \n       carve-out for contested elections;                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                 \n  \u00a7    The inability for shareholders to call special meetings;  \n                                                                 \n                                                                  \n  \u00a7    The inability for shareholders to act by written consent;  \n                                                                  \n                                        \n  \u00a7    A multi-class structure; and/or  \n                                        \n                                                \n  \u00a7    A non-shareholder approved poison pill.  \n                                                \nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote against or withhold votes from all director nominees if\nthe board lacks accountability and oversight, coupled with sustained poor performance relative to peers.\nSustained poor performance is measured by one-, three-, and five-year total shareholder returns in the\nbottom half of a company\u0092s four-digit GICS industry group (Russell 3000 companies only). Sustained poor\nperformance for companies outside the Russell 3000 universe is defined as underperforming peers or index on\nthe basis of one-, three-, and five-year total shareholder returns.\n\nClassified Boards ~ Annual Elections\n\nThe ability to elect directors is the single most important use of the shareholder franchise, and all\ndirectors should be accountable on an annual basis. Annually\nelected boards provide the best governance system for accountability to shareholders. A classified board is\na board that is divided into separate classes, with directors serving overlapping terms. A company with a\nclassified board usually divides\nthe board into three classes. Under this system, only one class of nominees comes up to shareholder vote at\nthe AGM each year.\n\nAs a consequence of these\nstaggered terms, shareholders only have the opportunity to vote on a single director approximately once\nevery three years. A classified board makes it difficult to change control of the board through a proxy\ncontest since it would normally take two\nyears to gain control of a majority of board seats. Under a classified board, the possibility of management\nentrenchment greatly increases. Classified boards can reduce director accountability by shielding directors,\nat least for a certain period of\ntime, from the consequences of their actions. Continuing directors who are responsible for a problematic\ngovernance issue at the board/committee level would avoid shareholders\u0092 reactions to their actions because\nthey would not be up for\nelection in that year. Ultimately, in these cases, the full board should be responsible for the actions of\nits directors.\n\nMany in management believe that\nstaggered boards provide continuity. Some shareholders believe that in certain cases a staggered board can\nprovide consistency and continuity in regard to decision-making and commitment that may be important to the\nlong-term financial future of the\ncompany.

While recognizing that boards have a fiduciary duty to\nuse all available means to protect shareholders\u0092 interests, as a best governance principle, boards should\nseek shareholder ratification\nof a poison pill (or an amendment thereof) within a reasonable period, to ensure that the features of the\npoison pill support the interests of shareholders and do not merely serve as a management entrenchment\ndevice. Boards that fail to do so should\nbe held accountable for ultimately disregarding shareholders\u0092 interests. In applying this principle to\nvoting in uncontested director elections, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services considers the term of the pill an\nimportant factor, as shorter-term\npills are generally less onerous as a takeover defense when compared to longer term pills, and may in some\ncases provide the board with a valuable tool to maximize shareholder value in the event of an opportunistic\noffer.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n\nGenerally vote against or withhold votes from all nominees (except new nominees3, who should be considered\non a case-by-case basis) if;\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The company has a poison pill (with a term of over one year) that was not approved by                \n       shareholders9;                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       The board makes a material adverse change to an existing pill, including, but not limited to,        \n  \u00a7    extension, renewal, or                                                                               \n       lowering the trigger, without shareholder approval; or                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                  \n  \u00a7    The company has a poison pill with a deadhand or slowhand  \n       feature10.                                                 \n                                                                  \nVote case-by-case on nominees if the board adopts an initial short-term\npill10 (with a term of one year or less) without shareholder approval, taking into consideration:\n                                                  \n  \u00a7    The disclosed rationale for the adoption;  \n                                                  \n                     \n  \u00a7    The trigger;  \n                     \n                                                                                          \n  \u00a7    The company\u0092s market capitalization (including absolute level and sudden changes);  \n                                                                                          \n                                                                   \n  \u00a7    A commitment to put any renewal to a shareholder vote; and  \n                                                                   \n                                   \n  \u00a7    Other factors as relevant.  \n                                   \n9 Approval prior to, or in connection, with a company\u0092s becoming publicly-traded, or in connection with a\nde-SPAC transaction, is insufficient.\n\n10 If a short-term pill with a deadhand or slowhand feature\nis enacted but expires before the next shareholder vote, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services will generally still\nrecommend withhold/against nominees at the next shareholder meeting following its adoption.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Diversity brings different\nperspectives to a board that in turn leads to a more varied\napproach to board issues. Taft-Hartley fiduciaries generally believe that increasing diversity in the\nboardroom would better reflect a company\u0092s workforce, customers, and community and enhance shareholder\nvalue.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Support proposals asking the board to make greater efforts to search for qualified female and        \n  \u00a7    minority candidates for                                                                              \n       nomination to the board of directors.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  \u00a7    Support endorsement of a policy of board inclusiveness.  \n                                                                \n                                                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Support reporting to shareholders on a company\u0092s efforts to increase diversity on their boards.  \n                                                                                                       \nStock Ownership Requirements\n\nCorporate directors should own some amount of stock of the companies on which they serve as board members.\nStock ownership is a simple method to align the interests\nof directors with company shareholders. Nevertheless, many highly qualified individuals such as academics\nand clergy who can offer valuable perspectives in boardrooms may be unable to purchase individual shares of\nstock. In such a circumstance, the\npreferred solution is to look at the board nominees individually and take stock ownership into consideration\nwhen voting on the merits of each candidate.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote against shareholder proposals requiring directors to own\na minimum amount of company stock in order to qualify as a director nominee or to remain on the board.\n\nBoard and Committee Size\n\nWhile there is no hard and fast rule among institutional investors as to what may be an optimal board size,\nthere is an acceptable range that companies should strive\nto meet and not exceed. A board that is too large may function inefficiently. Conversely, a board that is\ntoo small may allow the CEO to exert disproportionate influence or may stretch the time requirements of\nindividual directors too thin.\n\nProposals seeking to set board size will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Given that the preponderance\nof boards in the U.S. range between five and fifteen\ndirectors, many institutional investors believe this benchmark is a useful standard for evaluating such\nproposals.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

While term of office limitations can rid\nthe board of non-performing directors over time, it can also unfairly force experienced and effective\ndirectors off the board. When evaluating shareholder proposals on director term limits, consider whether the\ncompany\u0092s performance has been\npoor and whether problematic or entrenching governance provisions are in place at the company. Additionally,\nconsider board independence, including whether the board chair is independent.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote against shareholder proposals to limit the\ntenure of outside directors.\n\nCumulative Voting\n\nMost corporations provide that shareholders are entitled to cast one vote for each share owned. Under a\ncumulative voting scheme, the shareholder is\npermitted to have one vote per share for each director to be elected. Shareholders are permitted to\napportion those votes in any manner they wish among the director candidates. Thus, under a cumulative voting\nscheme, shareholders have the\nopportunity to elect a minority representative to a board by cumulating their votes, thereby ensuring\nminority representation for all sizes of shareholders.\n\nFor\nexample, if there is a company with a ten-member board and 500 shares outstanding-the total number of votes\nthat may be cast is 5,000. In this case a shareholder with 51 shares (10.2 percent of the outstanding\nshares) would be guaranteed one board\nseat because all votes may be cast for one candidate. Without cumulative voting, anyone controlling 51\npercent of shares would control the election of all ten directors.\n\nWith the advent and prevalence of majority voting for director elections, shareholders now have greater\nflexibility in supporting candidates for a company\u0092s\nboard of directors. Cumulative voting and majority voting are two different voting mechanisms designed to\nachieve two different outcomes. While cumulative voting promotes the interests of minority shareholders by\nallowing them to get some\nrepresentation on the board, majority voting promotes a democratic election of directors for all\nshareholders and ensures board accountability in uncontested elections. Though different in philosophic\nview, cumulative voting and majority voting can\nwork together operationally, with companies electing to use majority voting for uncontested elections and\ncumulative voting for contested elections to increase accountability and ensure minority representation on\nthe board.\n\nIn contested elections, similar to cumulative voting, proxy access allows shareholder access to the ballot\nwithout a veto from the nominating committee, but unlike\ncumulative voting, it also requires majority support to elect such directors.\n\nAt controlled companies, where majority insider control would preclude minority\nshareholders from having any representation on the board, cumulative voting would allow such representation\nand shareholder proposals for cumulative voting would be supported.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Generally vote against proposals to eliminate cumulative voting;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Taft-Hartley fiduciaries believe shareholders should have a greater voice in regard to\nthe election of directors and view majority threshold voting as a viable alternative to the current\ndeficiencies of the plurality system in the\nU.S.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Generally support reasonably crafted shareholders proposals calling for directors to be elected      \n       with an affirmative                                                                                  \n       majority of votes cast and/or the elimination of the plurality standard for electing directors       \n  \u00a7    (including binding resolutions requesting that the board amend the company\u0092s bylaws), provided the    \n       proposal includes a carve-out for a plurality                                                        \n       voting standard when there are more director nominees than board seats (e.g. in contested            \n       elections).                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Taft-Hartley Advisory Services may recommend a vote against or withhold votes from members of the    \n       board at companies                                                                                   \n       without the carve-out for plurality voting in contested elections, as the use of a majority vote     \n  \u00a7    standard can act as an anti-takeover defense in contested elections. (e.g. although the dissident    \n       nominees may have received more shares cast, as long                                                 \n       as the combination of withhold/against votes and the votes for the management nominees keep the      \n       dissident nominees under 50%, the management nominees will win, due to the holdover rules). This     \n       clearly contradicts the expressed will of shareholders.                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       In addition to supporting proposals seeking a majority vote standard in director elections,          \n       Taft-Hartley Advisory                                                                                \n  \u00a7    Services also support a post-election \u0093director resignation policy\u0094 that addresses the situation of    \n       holdover directors to accommodate both shareholder proposals and the need for stability and          \n       continuity of the board.                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nProxy Access\n\nThe current director election process as it exists leaves much to be desired. Companies currently nominate\nfor election only one candidate for each board seat.\nShareholders who oppose a candidate have no easy way to do so unless they are willing to undertake the\nconsiderable expense of running an independent candidate for the board. The only way for shareholders to\nregister dissent about a certain director\ncandidate is to vote against or \u0093withhold\u0094 support from that nominee. But because directors are still\nlargely elected by a plurality (those nominees receiving the most votes win board seats) at a large\nproportion of firms in the U.S.,\nnominees running unopposed are typically reelected despite shareholder opposition.\n\nMany investors view proxy access as an important shareholder right, one that\nis complementary to other best-practice corporate governance features. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services is\ngenerally supportive of reasonably crafted shareholder proposals advocating for the ability of long-term\nshareholders to cost-effectively\nnominate director candidates that represent their interests on management\u0092s proxy card. Shareholder\nproposals that have the potential to result in abuse of the proxy access right by way of facilitating\nhostile takeovers will generally not be\nsupported.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for management and shareholder proposals for\nproxy access with the following provisions:\n                                                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Ownership threshold: maximum requirement not more than three percent (3%)\u00a0of the voting power;  \n                                                                                                       \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Charter amendments may also include limited liability wherein a person\u0092s\nfinancial liability is limited to a\nfixed sum, or personal financial assets are not at risk if the individual loses a lawsuit that results in\nfinancial award/damages to the plaintiff. In contrast, shareholder proposals seek to provide for personal\nmonetary liability for fiduciary\nbreaches arising from gross negligence.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services may support these proposals when the company persuasively argues that such\naction is\nnecessary to attract and retain directors but will likely oppose management proposals and support\nshareholder proposals in order to promote greater accountability.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case, considering the stated rationale for the\nproposed change, on proposals to limit or eliminate entirely director and officer liability in regard to:\n(i) breach of the director\u0092s fiduciary \u0093duty of loyalty\u0094 and \u0093duty of care\u0094 to shareholders; (ii) acts or\nomissions not made in \u0093good faith\u0094 or involving intentional misconduct or knowledge of violations under the\nlaw; (iii) acts involving the unlawful purchases or redemptions of stock; (iv) payment of unlawful\ndividends; or (v) use of the position as director for receipt of improper personal benefits.\n\nDirector and Officer Indemnification\n\nIndemnification is the payment by a company of the expenses of directors who become involved in litigation\nas a result of their\nservice to a company. Proposals to indemnify a company\u0092s directors differ from those to eliminate or reduce\ntheir liability because with indemnification directors may still be liable for an act or omission, but the\ncompany will bear the\nexpense. Taft-Hartley fiduciaries may support these proposals when the company persuasively argues that such\naction is necessary to attract and retain directors, but should generally oppose indemnification when it is\nbeing proposed to insulate\ndirectors from actions that have already occurred.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Compensation\n\nThe housing market collapse and resulting credit crisis resulted in significant erosion of shareholder\nvalue, unprecedented levels of market volatility, and a lack of\nconfidence among financial market participants. Many Taft-Hartley trustees have questioned the role of\nexecutive compensation in incentivizing inappropriate or excessive risk-taking behavior by executives that\ncould threaten a corporation\u0091s\nlong-term viability. Further, generous severance packages and other payments to departing executives of\nfailed institutions have heightened attention on the issue of pay for performance.\n\nTrustees of Taft-Hartley funds, which have lost significant value in their investments as a result of the\nfinancial crisis, have little patience for \u0093pay for\nfailure\u0094 and continue to press for the adoption of executive compensation practices aimed at creating and\nsustaining long-term shareholder value.\n\nCompanies\nhave long argued that legally binding executive compensation obligations cannot be modified. The Capital\nPurchase Program implemented under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the \u0093bail out\u0094 program\nfor the U.S. financial\nsystem, set the tone for executive compensation reform and requires participating firms to accept certain\nlimits and requirements on executive compensation, regardless of existing contractual arrangements. A number\nof firms agreed to these\nrequirements.\n\nEvolving disclosure requirements have opened a wider window into compensation practices and processes,\ngiving shareholders more opportunity and\nresponsibility to ensure that pay is designed to create and sustain shareholder value. Companies in the U.S.\nare now required to evaluate and discuss potential risks arising from misguided or misaligned compensation\nprograms. The Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation\n(management \u0093Say on Pay\u0094), an advisory vote on the frequency of Say on Pay, as well as a shareholder\nadvisory vote on golden parachute\ncompensation. The advent of \u0093Say on Pay\u0094 votes for shareholders in the U.S. has provided a new communication\nmechanism and impetus for constructive engagement between shareholders and managers/directors on pay issues.\n\nEvaluation of Executive Pay\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services believes that executive pay programs should be fair, competitive, reasonable,\nand appropriate, and that pay for performance should be a\ncentral tenet in executive compensation philosophy. When evaluating executive and director pay programs and\npractices, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services looks for the following best practice considerations in the design\nand administration of executive\ncompensation programs:\n                                                                                                            \n       Appropriate pay-for-performance alignment with emphasis on long-term shareholder value: executive    \n       pay practices                                                                                        \n       must be designed to attract, retain, and appropriately motivate the key employees who drive          \n  \u00a7    shareholder value creation over the long term. Evaluating appropriate alignment of pay incentives    \n       with shareholder value creation includes taking into                                                 \n       consideration, among other factors, the link between pay and performance, the mix between fixed and  \n       variable pay, performance goals, and equity-based plan costs.                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Avoiding arrangements that risk \u0093pay for failure\u0094: this includes assessing the appropriateness of      \n  \u00a7    long                                                                                                 \n       or indefinite contracts, excessive severance packages, and guaranteed compensation.                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Independent and effective compensation committee: oversight of executive pay programs by directors   \n  \u00a7    with                                                                                                 \n       appropriate skills, knowledge, experience, and a sound process for compensation decision-making      \n       (e.g., including access to independent expertise and advice when needed) should be promoted.         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Clear, comprehensive compensation disclosures: shareholders expect companies to provide informative  \n  \u00a7    and timely                                                                                           \n       disclosures that enable shareholders to evaluate executive pay practices fully and fairly.           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Avoiding inappropriate pay to non-executive directors: compensation to outside directors should not  \n  \u00a7    compromise                                                                                           \n       their independence and ability to make appropriate judgments in overseeing managers\u0092 pay and          \n       performance.                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Granting stock options and restricted stock to executives that vest in five years   \n  \u00a7    does not necessarily provide a long-term focus, as executives can sell off the company shares once   \n       they vest. However, requiring senior executives to                                                   \n       hold company stock until retirement or after retirement can encourage a long-term focus on company   \n       performance.                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nPay-For-Performance Evaluation\n\nStock-based pay is often the main driver for excessive executive compensation, which could be fueled by poor\nplan\ndesign or administration. Therefore, it is important to closely examine any discrepancies between CEO pay\nand total shareholder returns over a sustained period of time in assessing equity-based compensation. Many\ninvestors do not consider standard\nstock options or time-vested restricted stock to be performance-based. If a company provides performance-\nbased incentives to its executives, the company should provide complete disclosure of the performance\nmeasures and goals to\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Complete and transparent disclosure enables shareholders to better comprehend the company\u0092s pay for\nperformance linkage.\n\nWhen financial or\noperational measures are utilized in incentive awards, the achievements related to these measures should\nultimately translate into superior shareholder returns in the long-term. The use of non-GAAP financial\nmetrics makes it very challenging for\nshareholders to ascertain the rigor of the program as shareholders often cannot tell the type of adjustments\nbeing made and if the adjustments were made consistently.\n\nPay-for-performance should be a central tenet in executive compensation philosophy.

The SEC has issued\nrules on executive and director\ncompensation that require expansive disclosure and a total compensation figure for each of the named\nexecutive officers. Poorly designed executive compensation plans or those lacking in transparency can be\nreflective of a poorly performing\ncompensation committee.\n\nExecutive compensation will continue to be in the spotlight in the ensuing years, particularly when\nshareholders are expected to have\naccess to more complete information.\n\nProblematic pay elements are generally evaluated case-by-case considering the context of a company\u0092s overall\npay\nprogram and demonstrated pay-for-performance philosophy.

This non-binding shareholder vote on compensation must\nbe included in a proxy or\nconsent or authorization at least once every 3 years.\n\nIn general, the management say on pay (MSOP) ballot item is the primary focus of voting on executive pay\npractices \u0096 dissatisfaction with compensation practices can be expressed by voting against MSOP rather than\nvoting against or withhold from the compensation committee. However, if there is no MSOP on the ballot, then\nthe negative vote will\napply to members of the compensation committee. In addition, in egregious cases, or if the board fails to\nrespond to concerns raised by a prior MSOP proposal, then Taft-Hartley fiduciaries should vote against or\nwithhold votes from compensation\ncommittee members (or, if the full board is deemed accountable, all directors). If the negative factors\ninvolve equity-based compensation, then a vote against an equity-based plan proposal presented for\nshareholder approval may be warranted.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Evaluate executive pay and practices, as well as certain aspects of outside director compensation    \n  \u00a7    on a case-by-case                                                                                    \n       basis.                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  \u00a7    Vote against management say on pay (MSOP) proposals if:  \n                                                                \n                                                                                              \n  \u00a7    There is an unmitigated misalignment between CEO pay and company performance (pay for  \n       performance);                                                                          \n                                                                                              \n                                                         \n  \u00a7    The company maintains problematic pay practices;  \n                                                         \n                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    The board exhibits poor communication and responsiveness to shareholders; or  \n                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n       The board has failed to demonstrate good stewardship of investors\u0092 interests regarding executive      \n  \u00a7    compensation                                                                                         \n       practices.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

The MSOP is at its essence a communication vehicle, and communication is most useful when\nit is received in a consistent and timely manner. Support for an annual MSOP vote is merited for many of the\nsame reasons Taft-Hartley\nAdvisory Services supports annual director elections rather than a classified board structure: because this\nprovides the highest level of accountability and direct communication by enabling the MSOP vote to\ncorrespond to the majority of the\ninformation presented in the accompanying proxy statement for the applicable shareholders\u0092 meeting. Having\nMSOP votes every two or three years, covering all actions occurring between the votes, would make it\ndifficult to create the meaningful\nand coherent communication that the votes are intended to provide. Under triennial elections, for example, a\ncompany would not know whether the shareholder vote references the compensation year being discussed or a\nprevious year, making it more\ndifficult to understand the implications of the vote.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for annual advisory votes on compensation, which provide\nthe most consistent and clear communication channel for shareholder concerns about companies\u0092 executive pay\nprograms.\n\nAdvisory Vote on Golden Parachutes in an Acquisition, Merger, Consolidation, or Proposed Sale\n\nThis is a proxy item regarding specific advisory votes on \u0093golden parachute\u0094 arrangements for Named\nExecutive Officers (NEOs) that is\nrequired under The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services\nplaces particular emphasis on severance packages that provide inappropriate windfalls and cover certain\nexecutive tax liabilities.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on proposals to approve the company\u0092s golden\nparachute compensation, consistent with Taft-Hartley Advisory Services\u0092 policies on problematic pay\npractices related to severance packages.

Indeed, a number of academic studies have found that there is\nlimited correlation between executive stock ownership and company performance. Misused stock options can\ngive executives an incentive to\ninflate their company\u0092s earnings, take excessive risks, and make irresponsibly optimistic forecasts in order\nto keep stock prices high and their paychecks gargantuan.\n\nTherefore, it is vital for shareholders to fully analyze all equity plans that appear on ballot.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:In general, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services evaluates executive\nand director compensation plans on a case-by-case basis. When evaluating equity-based compensation items on\nballot, the following elements will be considered:\n                                                                                                            \n       Dilution: Vote against plans in which the potential voting power dilution (VPD) of all shares        \n  \u00a7    outstanding exceeds                                                                                  \n       ten percent.                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Full Market Value: Awards must be granted at 100 percent of fair market value on the date of grant.  \n  \u00a7    However, in                                                                                          \n       instances when a plan is open to broad-based employee participation and excludes the five most       \n       highly compensated employees, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services accept a 15 percent discount.           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Burn Rate: Vote against plans where the company\u0092s value-adjusted burn rate exceeds the greater of:    \n       (1)\u00a0an                                                                                               \n       industry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the company\u0092s GICS group segmented  \n  \u00a7    by S&P 500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&P 500) and non-Russell 3000 index; and (2)\u00a0a de minimis   \n       threshold established                                                                                \n       separately for each of the S&P 500, the Russell 3000 index less the S&P 500, and the non-Russell     \n       3000 index.                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Liberal Definition of Change-in-Control: Vote against equity plans if the plan provides for the      \n       accelerated                                                                                          \n  \u00a7    vesting of equity awards even though an actual change in control may not occur.

Stock options, restricted stock and other forms of\nnon-cash compensation should be performance-based with an eye toward improving long-term corporate value.\nWell-designed stock option plans can align the interests of executives and shareholders by providing that\nexecutives benefit when stock prices\nrise so that the employees of the company, along with shareholders, prosper together. Likewise, option plans\nshould not allow for the benefits of share price gains without the risk of share price declines. Poorly\ndesigned stock option plans can\nencourage excessive risk-taking behavior and incentivize executives to pursue corporate strategies that\npromote short-term stock price to the ultimate detriment of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMany plans sponsored by management provide goals so easily attained that executives can realize massive\nrewards even though shareholder value is not created.\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services supports option plans when they provide legitimately challenging performance\ntargets that serve to truly motivate executives in the pursuit of sustained superior performance. Moreover,\nequity pay plans should be\ndesigned in a fashion that ensures executive compensation is veritably performance driven and \u0093at risk\u0094 such\nthat executives are penalized (by either reducing or withholding compensation) for failure to meet pre-\ndetermined performance\nhurdles. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services will oppose those plans that offer unreasonable benefits to\nexecutives that are not generally available to other shareholders or employees.\n\nVoting Power Dilution (VPD) Calculation\n\nVoting power dilution, or VPD, measures the amount of voting power represented by the number of shares\nreserved over the life of the plan. Industry norm dictates that\nten percent dilution over the life of a ten-year plan is reasonable for most mature companies. Restricted\nstock plans or stand-alone stock bonus plans that are not coupled with stock option plans can be held to a\nlower dilution cap.\n\nVoting power dilution may be calculated using the following formula:\n\nA: Shares reserved for this amendment or plan\n\nB: Shares available under this plan and/or continuing plans\nprior to proposed amendment\n\nC: Shares granted but\nunexercised under this plan and/or continuing plans\n\nD: All\noutstanding shares plus any convertible equity, outstanding warrants, or debt\n                                                           \n  The formula can be applied as follows:    A + B + C      \n                                            A + B + C + D  \n                                                           \nFair Market Value, Dilution and Repricing\n\nConsideration will be made as to whether the proposed plan is being offered at fair market value or at a\ndiscount; whether the plan excessively dilutes the earnings\nper share of the outstanding shares; and whether the plan gives management the ability to replace or reprice\n\u0093underwater\u0094 options. Repricing is an amendment to a previously granted stock option contract that reduces\nthe option exercise\nprice. Options are \u0093underwater\u0094 when their current price is below the current option contract price. Options\ncan also be repriced through cancellations and re-grants. The typical new grant would have a ten-year term,\nnew vesting\nrestrictions, and a lower exercise price reflecting the current lower market price.\n                                                                \n  W W W . I S S G O V E R N A N C E . C O    F-172    30\u00a0of\u00a072  \n  M                                                             \n                                                                \nBurn Rate\n\nThe annual burn rate is a measure of dilution that illustrates how rapidly a company is deploying shares\nreserved for equity compensation plans.\nA \u0093Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\u0094 is used for stock plan evaluations. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services will\ngenerally oppose plans whose Value-Adjusted Burn Rates exceed the greater of: (1) an industry-specific\nthreshold based on three-year\nburn rates within the company\u0092s GICS group segmented by S&P 500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&P 500) and\nnon-Russell 3000 index; and (2) a de minimis threshold established separately for each of the S&P 500, the\nRussell 3000\nindex less the S&P 500, and the non-Russell 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-rate benchmark changes will be\nlimited to a predetermined range above or below the prior year\u0092s burn-rate benchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate is calculated as follows:\n\nValue-Adjusted Burn\nRate = ((# of options * option\u0092s dollar value using a Black-Scholes model) + (# of full-value awards * stock\nprice)) / (Weighted average common shares * stock price).\n\nExecutive Concentration Ratio\n\nIn examining stock option awards, restricted stock and other forms of long-term incentives, it is important\nto consider internal pay equity; that is, the\nconcentration and distribution of equity awards to a company\u0092s top five executives (\u0093named officers\u0094) as a\npercentage of overall grants. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services will consider voting against equity\ncompensation plans whose\nannual grant rate to top executives exceeds one percent of shares outstanding.\n\nEvergreen Provisions\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services will oppose plans that reserve a specified percentage of outstanding shares\nfor award each year (evergreen plans)\ninstead of having a termination date. Such plans provide for an automatic increase in the shares available\nfor grant with or without limits on an annual basis. Because they represent a transfer of shareholder value\nand have a dilutive impact on a\nregular basis, evergreen plans are expensive to shareholders. Evergreen features also minimize the frequency\nthat companies seek shareholder approval in increasing the number of shares available under the plan.\n\nOption Exchange Programs/Repricing Options\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a\nshareholder vote.\n\nVote case-by-case on management proposals seeking approval to exchange/reprice options taking\ninto consideration the following factors:\n                                                                                                            \n       Historic trading patterns: the stock price should not be so volatile that the options are likely to  \n  \u00a7    be back                                                                                              \n       \u0093in-the-money\u0094 over the near term;                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                              \n  \u00a7    Rationale for the re-pricing: was the stock price decline beyond management\u0092s control?  \n                                                                                              \n                                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Option vesting: does the new option vest immediately or is there a black-out period?  \n                                                                                             \n                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Term of the option: the term should remain the same as that of the replaced option;  \n                                                                                            \n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Exercise price: should be set at fair market or a premium to market;  \n                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Participants: the plan should be broad-based and executive officers and directors must be excluded;  \n                                                                                                            \n                                            \n  \u00a7    Is this a value-for-value exchange?  \n                                            \n                                                                      \n  \u00a7    Are surrendered stock options added back to the plan reserve?  \n                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Timing--repricing should occur at least one year out from any precipitous drop in company\u0092s stock     \n       price.                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nIf the surrendered options are added back to the equity plans for re-issuance, then Taft-Hartley Advisory\nServices will also take into\nconsideration the impact on the company\u0092s equity plans and its three-year average burn rate.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The proposal\nshould clearly articulate why the board is choosing to conduct an exchange program at this point in time.\nRepricing underwater options after a\nrecent precipitous drop in the company\u0092s stock price demonstrates poor timing and warrants additional\nscrutiny. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services does not view market deterioration, in and of itself, as an\nacceptable reason for companies to\nreprice stock options and/or reset goals under performance plans. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services also\nconsiders the terms of the surrendered options, such as the grant date, exercise price and vesting schedule.\nGrant dates of surrendered options\nshould be far enough back (two to three years) so as not to suggest that repricings are being done to take\nadvantage of short-term downward price movements. Similarly, the exercise price of surrendered options\nshould be above the 52-week high for\nthe stock price.\n\nRestricted Stock\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services supports the use of performance-vesting restricted stock as long as the\nabsolute amount of restricted stock being granted is a\nreasonable proportion of an executive\u0092s overall compensation. The best way to align the interests of\nexecutives with shareholders is through direct stock holdings, coupled with at-risk variable compensation\nthat is tied to explicit and\nchallenging performance benchmarks. Performance-vesting restricted stock both adds to executive\u0092s direct\nshare holdings and incorporates at-risk features.\n\nTo reward performance and not job tenure, restricted stock vesting requirements should be performance-based\nrather than time lapsing. Such plans should explicitly\ndefine the performance criteria for awards to senior executives and may include a variety of corporate\nperformance measures in addition to the use of stock price targets. In addition, executives should be\nrequired to hold their vested restricted\nstock as long as they remain employees of the company.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) - Qualified Plans\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on qualified employee stock purchase plans.\nVote for plans if:\n                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Purchase price is at least 85 percent of fair market value;  \n                                                                    \n                                                  \n  \u00a7    Offering period is 27 months or less; and  \n                                                  \n                                                                                                      \n  \u00a7    The number of shares allocated to the plan is five percent or less of the outstanding shares.  \n                                                                                                      \nEmployee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) \u0096 Non-Qualified Plans\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on nonqualified employee stock purchase\nplans.

For example, compensation devices like executive pensions\n(SERPs), deferred compensation plans, below-market-rate loans or guaranteed post-retirement consulting fees\ncan amount to significant\nliabilities to shareholders and it is often difficult for investors to find adequate disclosure of their\nfull terms. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services opposes any perquisite or benefit to executives that exceeds what\nis generally offered to other\ncompany employees.

Given the large size of a typical\nannual equity compensation award, holding requirements that are based on a multiple of cash compensation may\nbe inadequate.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on shareholder proposals asking companies to\nadopt policies requiring senior executive officers to retain a portion of the net shares acquired through\ncompensation plans while employed or following the termination of their employment.\n\nPay for Superior Performance\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for shareholder proposals that request the\nboard to establish a pay-for-superior performance standard in the company\u0092s executive compensation programs\nfor senior executives.\n\nPerformance-Based Options\n\nStock options are intended to align the interests of management with those of shareholders. However, stock\noption grants without performance-based elements can\nexcessively compensate executives for stock increases due solely to a general stock market rise, rather than\nimproved or superior company stock performance. When option grants reach the hundreds of thousands, a\nrelatively small increase in the share\nprice may permit executives to reap millions of dollars without providing material benefits to shareholders.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services advocates for\nperformance-based awards \u0096 such as premium-priced or indexed \u0096 which encourage executives to outperform\npeers, certain indices, or the broader market rather than being rewarded for any minimal rise in the share\nprice, which can occur if\nthere are not empirical performance measures incorporated into the structure of the options. Additionally,\nit should be noted that performance-accelerated vesting and premium priced options allow fixed plan\naccounting, whereas performance-vested and\nindexed options entail certain expensing requirements.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for shareholder proposals that seek to provide\nfor performance-based options such as indexed and/or premium priced options.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Auditors\n\nAuditors play an integral role in certifying the integrity and reliability of corporate financial statements\non which investors rely to gauge the financial well-being\nof a company and the viability of an investment. The well-documented auditor-facilitated bankruptcies and\nscandals at several large public companies in recent years underscore the catastrophic consequences that\ninvestors can suffer when the audit\nprocess breaks down.\n\nAuditor Independence\n\nThe wave of accounting scandals over the past decade illuminates the need to ensure auditor independence in\nthe face of consulting services to audit clients. The\nratio of non-audit services to total revenues at the large accounting firms grew significantly leading up to\nthe accounting scandals. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services believes the ratio of non-audit fees should make up\nno more than one-quarter of all\nfees paid to the auditor so as to properly discourage even the appearance of any undue influence upon an\nauditor\u0092s objectivity.\n\nUnder SEC rules, disclosed\ncategories of professional fees paid for audit and non-audit services are as follows: (1) Audit Fees, (2)\nAudit-Related Fees, (3) Tax Fees, and (4) All Other Fees. Under the reporting requirements, companies are\nrequired to\ndescribe \u0096 in qualitative terms \u0096 the types of services provided under the three categories other than Audit\nFees. The following fee categories are defined as: A) tax compliance or preparation fees are excluded from\nour calculations of\nnon-audit fees; and B) fees for consulting services for tax-avoidance strategies and tax shelters will be\nincluded in \u0093other fees\u0094 and will be considered non-audit fees if the proxy disclosure does not indicate the\nnature of the tax\nservices. In circumstances where \u0093Other\u0094 fees include fees related to significant one-time capital structure\nevents: initial public offerings, bankruptcy emergence, and spin-offs; and the company makes public\ndisclosure of the amount and\nnature of those fees which are an exception to the standard \u0093non-audit fee\u0094 category, then such fees may be\nexcluded from the non-audit fees considered in determining the ratio of non-audit to audit/audit-related\nfees/tax compliance and\npreparation for purposes of determining whether non-audit fees are excessive.\n\nAs auditors are the backbone upon which a company\u0092s financial health is\nmeasured, auditor independence is absolutely essential for rendering objective opinions upon which investors\nthen rely. When an auditor is paid excessive consulting fees in addition to fees paid for auditing, the\ncompany-auditor relationship is left\nopen to conflicts of interest.\n\nAuditor Ratification\n\nThe ratification of auditors is an important component of good governance. In light of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002 and increased shareholder scrutiny, some\ncompanies are opting to take auditor ratification off the ballot. Neglecting to include the ratification of\nauditors on the proxy takes away the fundamental shareholder right to ratify the company\u0092s choice of\nauditor. Whereas shareholder\nratification of auditors was once considered routine by many shareowners, accounting scandals have caused\nshareholders to be more vigilant about the integrity of the auditors certifying their companies\u0092 financial\nstatements. It is now viewed as\nbest practice for companies to place the item on ballot.\n\nAlthough U.S. companies are not legally required to allow shareholders to ratify their appointment of\nindependent auditors, submission of the audit firm for approval at the annual meeting on an annual basis\ngives shareholders the means to weigh in on their satisfaction (or lack thereof) of the auditor\u0092s\nindependent execution of their duties.\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services believes mandatory auditor ratification is in line with sound and transparent\ncorporate governance and remains an important mechanism to ensure the integrity of the auditor\u0092s work. In\nthe absence of legislation\nmandating shareholder ratification of auditors, the failure by a company to present its selection of\nauditors for shareholder ratification should be discouraged as it undermines good governance and\ndisenfranchises shareholders.\n\nProposals to ratify auditors is examined for potential conflicts of interest, with particular attention to\nthe fees paid to the auditor, as well as whether the\nratification of auditors has been put up for shareholder vote.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Such long-standing relationships\nfoster an undesirable coziness between audit firms and their clients, which can cause the auditors to lose\ntheir independence and become less questioning especially where lucrative contracts for the provision of\nnon-audit consulting services are\ninvolved. Mandatory auditor rotation is a widely supported safeguard against improper audits and is viewed\nby many as an effective mechanism for mitigating the potential risks borne by long-term auditor-client\nrelationships.\n\nProponents of compulsory audit firm rotation contend that rotation policies promote objectivity and\nindependence among auditors and minimize the scope of vested\ninterests developing in the audit. Opponents of audit firm rotation argue that regular re-tendering is a\ncostly practice, likely to reduce audit quality and increase the risk of audit failure in the early years\ndue to the time required to gain\ncumulative knowledge of an often complex and geographically diverse business. A solution around this\napparent negative effect of mandatory rotation is to keep a longer rotation period.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services recommends that companies not maintain the same audit firm in excess of seven\nyears, and will vote against auditors if their tenure at\na company exceeds seven years. A revolving seven-year rotation period allows the auditor to develop\ncumulative knowledge of a company\u0092s business and the effect of changes in the business along with the\ncorresponding changes in its risks,\nthereby enhancing the quality of the audit and trammeling potential loss of auditor objectivity and\nindependence. Many institutional investors argue that the increased costs associated with compulsory auditor\nrotation are a lesser evil\nvis-\u00e0-vis the larger evil of the costs to shareholders when the objectionable coziness between clients and\nlong-standing auditors leads to gross erosion of shareholder value.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally support shareholder proposals to ensure auditor\nindependence through measures such as mandatory auditor rotation (no less than every seven years).\n\nAuditor Indemnification and Limitation of Liability\n\nIndemnification clauses allow auditors to avoid\nliability for potential damages, including punitive damages. Eliminating concerns about being sued for\ncarelessness could lead to; 1) potential impairment of external auditor independence and impartiality by\ncontractual clauses limiting their\nliability; and 2) a decrease in the quality and reliability of the audit given the lack of consequence for\nan inadequate audit.\n\nGiven the substantial settlements\nagainst auditors in recent years for poor audit practices and the cost of such insurance to the company and\nits shareholders, there are legitimate concerns over the broader use of indemnification clauses. Such\nagreements may weaken the objectivity,\nimpartiality and performance of audit firms.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services believes it is important for shareholders to understand the full risks and\nimplications of these agreements and determine what impact they could have on shareholder value. At the\npresent time, however, due to poor disclosure in this area, it is difficult to identify the existence and\nextent of limited liability provisions\nand auditor agreements, and investors lack the information needed to make informed decisions regarding these\nagreements.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

As such, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services reviews the use\nof indemnification clauses and limited liability provisions in auditor agreements on a case-by-case basis,\nwhen disclosure is present.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote against or withhold from audit committee members if there\nis persuasive evidence that the audit committee entered into an inappropriate indemnification agreement with\nits auditor that limits the ability of the company, or its shareholders, to pursue legitimate legal recourse\nagainst the audit firm.\n\nDisclosures Under Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that companies document and assess the effectiveness of their\ninternal financial controls.\nBeginning in 2005, most public companies must obtain annual attestation of the effectiveness of their\ninternal controls over financial reporting from their outside auditors. Companies with significant material\nweaknesses identified in the\nSection 404 disclosures potentially have ineffective internal financial reporting controls. This may lead to\ninaccurate financial statements, which hampers shareholders\u0092 ability to make informed investment decisions,\nand may lead to\ndestruction of public confidence and shareholder value. The audit committee is ultimately responsible for\nthe integrity and reliability of the company\u0092s financial information and its system of internal controls.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote against or withhold votes from audit committee members under certain circumstances when a       \n  \u00a7    material weakness rises to                                                                           \n       a level of serious concern, if there are chronic internal control issues, or if there is an absence  \n       of established effective control mechanisms.                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote against management proposals to ratify auditors if there is reason to believe that the          \n  \u00a7    independent auditor has                                                                              \n       rendered an opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company\u0092s financial position.     \n                                                                                                            \nAdverse Opinions\n\nAn Adverse Opinion on the company\u0092s financial statements is issued when the auditor determines that the\nfinancial statements\nare materially misstated and, when considered as a whole, do not conform to GAAP. It essentially states that\nthe information contained is materially incorrect, unreliable, and inaccurate in order to assess the\ncompany\u0092s financial position and\nresults of operations.\n\nAdverse opinions on companies\u0092 financial statements are generally very rare because they essentially state\nthat a significant portion\nof the financial statements are unreliable and the auditor had no choice but to issue an adverse opinion\nafter a long process of seeking resolution with the company subjected to the audit.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote against or withhold votes from audit committee members if\nthe company receives an adverse opinion on the company\u0092s financial statements from its auditors.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Takeover Defenses\n\nPoison Pills\n\nShareholder rights plans, typically known as poison pills, take the form of rights or warrants issued to\nshareholders and are triggered when a potential acquiring\nstockholder reaches a certain threshold of ownership. When triggered, poison pills generally allow\nshareholders to purchase shares from, or sell shares back to, the target company (\u0093flip-in pill\u0094) and/or the\npotential acquirer\n(\u0093flip-out pill\u0094) at a price far out of line with fair market value.\n\nDepending on the type of pill, the triggering event can either transfer wealth\nfrom the target company or dilute the equity holdings of current shareholders. Poison pills insulate\nmanagement from the threat of a change in control and provide the target board with veto power over takeover\nbids. Because poison pills greatly\nalter the balance of power between shareholders and management, shareholders should be allowed to make their\nown evaluation of such plans.\n\nIn evaluating\nmanagement proposals on poison pills, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services considers the company\u0092s rationale for\nadopting the pill and its existing governance structure in determining whether or not the pill appropriately\nserves in shareholders\u0092\nbest interests. The rationale for adopting the pill should be thoroughly explained by the company.\nAdditionally, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services examines the company\u0092s existing governance structure including:\nboard independence, existing\ntakeover defenses, or any problematic governance concerns.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals that ask a company to submit its poison pill for shareholder          \n       ratification.                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Vote case-by-case on shareholder proposals to redeem a company\u0092s poison pill.  \n                                                                                     \n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Vote case-by-case on management proposals to ratify a poison pill.  \n                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote against or withhold from any board where a dead-hand poison pill provision is in place. From a  \n  \u00a7    shareholder                                                                                          \n       perspective, there is no justification for a dead-hand provision. Directors of companies with these  \n       lethal protective devices should be held fully accountable.                                          \n                                                                                                            \nNet Operating Loss (NOL) Poison Pills/Protective Amendments\n\nThe financial crisis prompted widespread losses in certain industries. This resulted in previously\nprofitable companies considering the adoption of a poison pill\nand/or NOL protective amendment to protect their NOL tax assets, which may be lost upon an acquisition of 5\npercent of a company\u0092s shares.\n\nWhen evaluating\nmanagement proposals seeking to adopt NOL pills or protective amendments, the purpose behind the proposal,\nits terms, and the company\u0092s existing governance structure should be taken into account to assess whether\nthe structure actively promotes\nboard entrenchment or adequately protects shareholder rights. While the high estimated tax value of NOLs\nwould typically benefit shareholders, the ownership acquisition limitations contained in an NOL\npill/protective amendment coupled with a\ncompany\u0092s problematic governance structure could serve as an antitakeover device.\n\nGiven the low ownership thresholds involved, shareholders want to ensure\nthat such pills/amendments do not remain in effect permanently. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services will closely\nreview whether the pill/amendment contains a sunset provision or a commitment to cause the expiration of the\nNOL pill/protective amendment\nupon exhaustion or expiration of the NOLs.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote against proposals to adopt a poison pill/ protective amendment for the stated purpose of        \n  \u00a7    protecting a company\u0092s                                                                                \n       net operating losses (\u0093NOLs\u0094) if the term of the pill/ protective amendment would exceed the shorter   \n       of three years and the exhaustion of the NOL.                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Many companies have sought shareholder approval for charter or bylaw\namendments that would prohibit the removal of directors except for cause, thus ensuring that directors would\nretain their directorship for\ntheir full-term unless found guilty of self-dealing. By requiring cause to be demonstrated through due\nprocess, management insulates the directors from removal even if a director has been performing poorly, not\nattending meetings, or not acting in\nthe best interests of shareholders.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals that provide that directors may be removed only for cause.  \n                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals which seek to restore the authority of shareholders to remove directors with or   \n       without cause.                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals that provide only continuing directors may elect replacements to fill board   \n       vacancies.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals that permit shareholders to elect directors to fill board vacancies.  \n                                                                                                \nShareholder Ability to Alter the Size of the Board\n\nProposals that would allow management to increase or decrease the size of the board at its own discretion\nare often used by companies as a takeover defense.

Shareholder Rights\n\nConfidential Voting\n\nThe confidential ballot ensures that voters are not subject to real or perceived coercion. In an open voting\nsystem, management can determine who has voted against\nits nominees or proposals before a final vote count. As a result, shareholders can be pressured to vote with\nmanagement at companies with which they maintain or would like to establish a business relationship.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals that request corporations to adopt confidential voting, the use of    \n       independent tabulators,                                                                              \n       and the use of independent inspectors for an election as long as the proposals include clauses for   \n  \u00a7    proxy contests. In the case of a contested election, management is permitted to request that the     \n       dissident group honor its confidential voting policy.                                                \n       If the dissidents agree, the policy remains in place. If the dissidents do not agree, the            \n       confidential voting policy is waived.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                               \n  \u00a7    Vote for management proposals to adopt confidential voting procedures.  \n                                                                               \nShareholder Ability to Call Special Meetings\n\nMost state corporation statutes allow shareholders to call a special meeting when they want to take action\non certain matters that arise between regularly scheduled\nannual meetings. Sometimes this right applies only if a shareholder or a group of shareholders own a\nspecified percentage of shares, with ten percent being the most common. Shareholders may lose the ability to\nremove directors, initiate a\nshareholder resolution, or respond to a beneficial offer without having to wait for the next scheduled\nmeeting if they are unable to act at a special meeting of their own calling.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to call special meetings.  \n                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Generally vote for proposals that remove restrictions on the right of shareholders to act            \n       independently of management.                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Vote against provisions that would require advance notice of more than sixty days.  \n                                                                                           \nShareholder Ability to Act by Written Consent\n\nConsent solicitations allow shareholders to vote on and respond to shareholder and management proposals by\nmail without having to act at a physical meeting. A consent\ncard is sent by mail for shareholder approval and only requires a signature for action. Some corporate\nbylaws require supermajority votes for consents, while at others standard annual meeting rules apply.\nShareholders may lose the ability to remove\ndirectors, initiate a shareholder resolution, or respond to a beneficial offer without having to wait for\nthe next scheduled meeting if they are unable to act by written consent.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to take action by written         \n       consent.                                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Generally vote for proposals to allow or make easier shareholder action by written consent.  \n                                                                                                    \nUnequal Voting Rights\n\nIncumbent managers are able to use unequal voting rights through the creation of a separate class of shares\nthat has superior voting rights to the common shares of\nregular shareholders. This separate class of shares with disproportionate\n                                                                \n  W W W . I S S G O V E R N A N C E .

Dual class exchange offers involve a\ntransfer of voting rights from one group of shareholders to another group of shareholders typically through\nthe payment of a preferential dividend.\nA dual class recapitalization plan also establishes two classes of common stock with unequal voting rights,\nbut initially involves an equal distribution of preferential and inferior voting shares to current\nshareholders.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Vote for resolutions that seek to maintain or convert to a one-share-one-vote capital structure.  \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally vote against requests for the creation or continuation of dual class capital structures    \n  \u00a7    or the creation of new                                                                               \n       or additional super-voting shares.                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nSupermajority Shareholder Vote Requirement to Amend the Charter or Bylaws\n\nSupermajority shareholder vote requirements for charter or bylaw amendments are often the result of \u0093lock-\nin\u0094 votes,\nwhich are the votes required to repeal new provisions to the corporate charter. Supermajority provisions\nviolate the principle that a simple majority of voting shares should be all that is necessary to effect\nchange regarding a company and its\ncorporate governance provisions. Requiring more than this may entrench managers by blocking actions that are\nin the best interests of shareholders.\n\nThe general\nlack of credit availability for financially distressed companies has resulted in \u0093rescue\u0094 or highly dilutive\nstock and warrant issuances, which often comprise a majority of the company\u0092s voting stock upon conversion.\nWhen an investor\ntakes control of the company through the conversion of securities, the new owners often seek statutory\namendments, such as adopting written consent, or allowing 50 percent shareholders to call a special meeting,\nthat allow effective control over the\ncompany with little or no input from minority shareholders.\n\nIn such cases, the existing supermajority vote requirements would serve to protect minority\nshareholders\u0092 interests.

Firms have also argued that making Delaware the sole forum for\nlawsuits avoids the possibility\nof duplicative suits arising out of the same events. A number of shareholder advocates have, however,\ncountered that exclusive venue provisions deprive shareholders of the flexibility to choose the forum in\nwhich to assert claims of wrongdoing.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote against management proposals to restrict the\nvenue for shareholder claims by adopting charter or bylaw provisions that seek to establish an exclusive\njudicial forum.\n\nFee-Shifting Bylaws\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote against bylaws that mandate fee-shifting\nwhenever plaintiffs are not completely successful on the merits (i.e., in cases where the plaintiffs are\npartially successful).\n\nBundled Proposals\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on bundled or conditional proxy proposals.\nIn the case of items that are conditioned upon each other, examine the benefits and costs of the packaged\nitems. In instances when the joint effect of the conditioned items is not in shareholders\u0092 best interests,\nvote against the proposals. If the combined effect is positive, support such proposals.\n\n6. Mergers & Acquisitions / Corporate Restructurings\n\nA number of academic and industry studies have estimated that nearly three quarters of all corporate\nacquisitions fail to create economically meaningful shareholder\nvalue. These studies have also demonstrated that the larger the deal the greater the risk in realizing long-\nterm value for shareholders of the acquiring firm. These risks include integration challenges, over-\nestimation of expected synergies,\nincompatible corporate cultures and poor succession planning. Indeed, some studies have found that smaller\ndeals within specialized industries on average outperform \u0093big bet\u0094 larger deals by a statistically\nsignificant factor.\n\nIn analyzing M&A deals, private placements or other transactional related items on proxy, Taft-Hartley\nAdvisory Services performs a well-rounded analysis that\nseeks to balance all facets of the deal to ascertain whether the proposed acquisition is truly going to\ngenerate long-term value for shareholders and enhance the prospects of the ongoing corporation.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Votes on mergers and acquisitions are always considered on a\ncase-by-case basis, taking into account the following factors:\n                                                   \n  \u00a7    Impact of the merger on shareholder value;  \n                                                   \n                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Perspective of ownership (target vs. acquirer) in the deal;  \n                                                                    \n                                                                \n  \u00a7    Form and mix of payment (i.e. stock, cash, debt, etc.);  \n                                                                \n                                                   \n  \u00a7    Fundamental value drivers behind the deal;  \n                                                   \n                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Anticipated financial and operating benefits realizable through combined synergies;  \n                                                                                            \n                                        \n  \u00a7    Offer price (cost vs. premium);  \n                                        \n                                                          \n  \u00a7    Change-in-control payments to executive officers;  \n                                                          \n                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Financial viability of the combined companies as a single entity;  \n                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n       Was the deal put together in good faith?

In\nsuch a hostile takeover, the bidder offers cash for enough shares to gain control of the target. At the same\ntime, the acquirer states that once control has been obtained, the target\u0092s remaining shares will be\npurchased with cash, cash and\nsecurities, or only securities. Since the payment offered for the remaining stock is, by design, less\nvaluable than the original offer for the controlling shares, shareholders are forced to sell out early to\nmaximize the value of their shares.\nStandard fair price provisions require that in the absence of board or shareholder approval of the\nacquisition the bidder must pay the remaining shareholders the same price for their shares that brought\ncontrol.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for fair price proposals as long as the shareholder vote requirement embedded in the provision  \n  \u00a7    is no more than a                                                                                    \n       majority of disinterested shares.                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to lower the shareholder vote requirement in existing fair price      \n       provisions.                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nAppraisal Rights\n\nRights of appraisal provide shareholders who do not approve of the terms of certain corporate transactions\nthe right to demand a judicial review in order to determine\nthe fair value for their shares.

While the number of bankruptcies has risen as evidenced by many firms, including General Motors\nand Lehman Brothers, the prevalence of these reorganizations can vary year over year due to, among other\nthings, market conditions and a\ncompany\u0091s ability to sustain its operations. Additionally, the amount of time that lapses between a\nparticular company\u0091s entrance into Chapter 11 and its submission of a plan of reorganization varies\nsignificantly depending on the\ncomplexity, timing, and jurisdiction of the particular case. These plans are often put to a vote of\nshareholders (in addition to other interested parties), as required by the Bankruptcy Code.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on proposals to common shareholders on\nbankruptcy plans of reorganization, considering the following factors including, but not limited to:\n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Estimated value and financial prospects of the reorganized company;  \n                                                                            \n                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Percentage ownership of current shareholders in the reorganized company;  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n       Whether shareholders are adequately represented in the reorganization process (particularly through  \n  \u00a7    the existence of an                                                                                  \n       official equity committee);                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The cause(s) of the bankruptcy filing, and the extent to which the plan of reorganization addresses  \n       the cause(s);                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                               \n  \u00a7    Existence of a superior alternative to the plan of reorganization; and  \n                                                                               \n                                               \n  \u00a7    Governance of the reorganized company.  \n                                               \nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Corporations (SPACs)\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on SPAC mergers and acquisitions taking into\naccount the following:\n                                                                                                            \n       Valuation - Is the value being paid by the SPAC reasonable?

Capital Structure\n\nThe management of a corporation\u0092s capital structure involves a number of important issues including dividend\npolicy, types of assets, opportunities for growth,\nability to finance new projects internally, and the cost of obtaining additional capital. Many financing\ndecisions have a significant impact on shareholder value, particularly when they involve the issuance of\nadditional common stock, preferred\nstock, or debt.\n\nCommon Stock Authorization\n\nState statutes and stock exchanges require shareholder approval for increases in the number of common\nshares. Corporations increase their supply of common stock for a\nvariety of ordinary business purposes: raising new capital, funding stock compensation programs, business\nacquisitions, implementation of stock splits, or payment of stock dividends.\n\nClear justification should accompany all management requests for shareholder approval of increases in\nauthorized common stock. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services supports\nincreases in authorized common stock to fund stock splits that are in shareholders\u0092 interests. Dual requests\non the same ballot, in which an increase in common stock is requested in tandem with a reverse stock split\nin which shares are not\nproportionately reduced may not be in shareholder best interests. Although the reverse stock split may be\nneeded in the face of imminent delisting, there is little justification in effectively approving two\nincreases in common stock on the same\nballot.\n\nGeneral Authorization Requests\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n\nVote case-by-case on proposals to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock that are to be\nused for general corporate purposes.\n\nVote for an increase of up to 50 percent of current authorized shares.\n\nGenerally vote against proposed increases, even if less than or equal to 50 percent, if the proposal or the\ncompany\u0092s prior or ongoing use of authorized shares\nis problematic, including, but not limited to:\n                                                                                                            \n       The proposal seeks to increase the number of authorized shares of the class of common stock that     \n  \u00a7    has superior voting                                                                                  \n       rights to other share classes;                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       On the same ballot is a proposal for a reverse split for which support is warranted despite the      \n  \u00a7    fact that it would result                                                                            \n       in an excessive increase in the share authorization;                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                           \n  \u00a7    The company has a non-shareholder approved poison pill (including an NOL pill); or  \n                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n       The company has previous sizeable placements (within the past 3 years) of stock with insiders at     \n  \u00a7    prices substantially                                                                                 \n       below market value, or with problematic voting rights, without shareholder approval.                 \n                                                                                                            \nHowever, generally vote for proposed increases above 50\npercent of the current authorized shares when there is disclosure of specific and severe risks to\nshareholders of not approving the request, such as:\n                                                                                                            \n       In or subsequent to the company\u0092s most recent 10-K filing, the company discloses that there is        \n  \u00a7    substantial doubt                                                                                    \n       about its ability to continue as a going concern;                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       The company states that there is a risk of imminent bankruptcy or imminent liquidation if            \n  \u00a7    shareholders do not approve the                                                                      \n       increase in authorized capital; or                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                    \n  \u00a7    A government body has in the past year required the company to increase its capital ratios.  \n                                                                                                    \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Stock splits/dividends do not affect the equity of the company. An understanding of\nforward and reverse stock splits and stock dividends is relevant because proposals to increase authorized\ncommon shares may be tied to the\nimplementation of a planned stock distribution.\n\nShareholders can effectively cancel a split or dividend if the company does not have sufficient shares to\nimplement a split without an increase in authorized shares.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for management proposals to increase the common\nshare authorization for stock split or stock dividend, provided that the increase in authorized shares is\nreasonable in accordance with Taft-Hartley Advisory Services\u0092 Common Stock Authorization policy.\n\nReverse Stock Splits\n\nReverse splits exchange multiple shares for a lesser amount to increase share price. Increasing share price\nis sometimes necessary to\nrestore a company\u0092s share price to a level that will allow it to be traded on the national stock exchanges.\nIn addition, some brokerage houses have a policy of not monitoring or investing in very low priced shares.\nReverse stock splits can help\nmaintain stock liquidity.\n\nEvaluation of management proposals to implement a reverse stock split will take into account whether there\nis a corresponding\nproportional decrease in authorized shares. Without a corresponding decrease, a reverse stock split is\neffectively an increase in authorized shares by way of reducing the number of shares outstanding, while\nleaving the number of authorized shares to\nbe issued at the pre-split level.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for management proposals to implement a reverse stock\nsplit if:\n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The number of authorized shares will be proportionately reduced; or  \n                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The effective increase in authorized shares is equal to or less than half of the company\u0092s existing   \n       authorization.                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nVote case-by-case on proposals that do not meet either of the above conditions, taking into consideration\nthe following factors:\n                                                                                \n  \u00a7    Stock exchange notification to the company of a potential delisting; or  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n       Disclosure of substantial doubt about the company\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern without    \n  \u00a7    additional                                                                                           \n       financing;                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                   \n  \u00a7    The company\u0092s rationale; or  \n                                   \n                                     \n  \u00a7    Other factors as applicable.  \n                                     \n                                                                \n  W W W .

The burden of proof will be on the\ncompany to establish that it has a need for the higher limit.\n\nRenewal of such mandates should be sought at each year\u0092s annual meeting.\n\nVote case-by-case on share issuances for a specific transaction or financing proposal.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

State of Incorporation\n\nVoting on State Takeover Statutes\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Review on a case-by-case basis proposals to opt in or\nout of state takeover statutes (including control share acquisition statutes, control share cash-out\nstatutes, freeze out provisions, fair price provisions, stakeholder laws, poison pill endorsements,\nseverance pay and labor contract provisions,\nanti-greenmail provisions, and disgorgement provisions). Taft-Hartley Advisory Services generally supports\nopting into stakeholder protection statutes if they provide comprehensive protections for employees and\ncommunity stakeholders. Taft-Hartley\nAdvisory Services is less supportive of takeover statutes that only serve to protect incumbent management\nfrom accountability to shareholders and which negatively influence shareholder value.\n\nReincorporation Proposals\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Management or shareholder proposals to change a\ncompany\u0092s state of incorporation should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, giving consideration to both\nfinancial and corporate governance concerns including the following:\n                                     \n  \u00a7    Reasons for reincorporation;  \n                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Comparison of company\u0092s governance practices and provisions prior to and following the                \n       reincorporation; and                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                \n  \u00a7    Comparison of corporation laws of original state and destination state.  \n                                                                                \nVote for reincorporation when the economic factors outweigh any neutral or negative governance changes.\n\nOffshore Reincorporations and Tax Havens\n\nFor a company that seeks to reincorporate, Taft-Hartley Advisory Services evaluates the merits of the move\non a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the\ncompany\u0092s strategic rationale for the move, the potential economic ramifications, potential tax benefits,\nand any corporate governance changes that may impact shareholders. Taft-Hartley Advisory Services believes\nthere are a number of concerns\nassociated with a company looking to reincorporate from the United States to offshore locales such as\nBermuda, the Cayman Islands or Panama. With more U.S.-listed companies seeking to move offshore,\nshareholders are beginning to understand the web\nof complexities surrounding the legal, tax, and governance implications involved in such a transaction.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Vote case-by-case on proposed offshore moves, taking into consideration:  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n       Legal recourse for U.S. stockholders of the new company and the enforcement of legal judgments       \n  \u00a7    against the company under                                                                            \n       the U.S. securities laws;                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The transparency (or lack thereof) of the new locale\u0092s legal system;  \n                                                                            \n                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Adoption of any shareholder-unfriendly corporate law provisions;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Actual, quantifiable tax benefits associated with foreign incorporation;  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Potential for accounting manipulations and/or discrepancies;  \n                                                                     \n                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Any pending U.S. legislation concerning offshore companies;  \n                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n       Prospects of reputational harm and potential damage to brand name via increased media coverage       \n  \u00a7    concerning corporate                                                                                 \n       expatriation.                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally vote for shareholder requests calling for \u0093expatriate\u0094 companies that are domiciled abroad   \n  \u00a7    yet                                                                                                  \n       predominantly owned and operated in America to re-domesticate back to a U.S. state jurisdiction.     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

U.S. policies will also apply to\ncompanies listed on U.S. exchanges as Foreign Private Issuers (FPIs) and that may be exempt from the\ndisclosure and corporate governance\nrequirements that apply to most companies traded on U.S. exchanges, including a number of SEC rules and\nstock market listing requirements. Corporations that have reincorporated outside the U.S. have found\nthemselves subject to a combination of\ngovernance regulations and best practice standards that may not be entirely compatible with an evaluation\nframework based solely on the country of incorporation.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Corporate Responsibility & Accountability\n\nSocial, Environmental and Sustainability Issues\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services generally supports social, workforce, and environmental shareholder-sponsored\nresolutions if they seek to create responsible corporate\ncitizens while at the same time attempting to enhance long-term shareholder value. Taft-Hartley Advisory\nServices typically supports proposals that ask for disclosure reporting of information that is not available\noutside the company that is not\nproprietary in nature. Such reporting is particularly most vital when it appears that a company has not\nadequately addressed shareholder concerns regarding social, workplace, environmental and/or other issues.

In order to be able to intelligently monitor their investments, shareholders\noften need information that is best provided by the company in which they have invested on behalf of their\nend beneficiaries. Qualified\nrequests satisfying the aforementioned criteria usually merit support.\n\nProposals requesting that the company cease certain actions that the proponent believes\nare harmful to society or some segment of society will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Special\nattention will be made to the company\u0092s legal and ethical obligations, its ability to remain profitable, and\npotential negative publicity if\nthe company fails to honor the request. A high standard will need to be met by proponents requesting\nspecific action like divesture of a business line or operation, legal remuneration, or withdrawal from\ncertain high-risk markets.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

GENERAL CSR RELATED\n\nSpecial Policy Review and Shareholder Advisory Committees\n\nThese resolutions propose the establishment of special committees of the board to address broad corporate\npolicy and provide forums for ongoing dialogue on issues\nincluding, but not limited to: shareholder relations, the environment, occupational health and safety, and\nexecutive compensation.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Support these proposals when they appear to offer a\npotentially effective method for enhancing shareholder value.\n                                                                                                            \n   International Operations                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nThe rise of globalization has put increasing importance on the need for U.S. companies to periodically\nmonitor their business operations abroad. As a means to\npreserve brand integrity and protect against potentially costly litigation and negative public relations,\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services generally supports shareholder proposals which call for a report on the\ncompany\u0092s core business policies\nand procedures of its operations outside the United States.\n\nMany of the resolutions which address a company\u0092s international policies can include: impact of\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI) in emerging market economies; corporate safeguards against money laundering;\nterrorist financing; economic de-stabilization concerns; relationships with international financial\ninstitutions (IFIs); and product\nsales/marketing abroad (i.e., tobacco, pharmaceutical drug pricing).\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally support proposals asking for policy clarification\nand reporting on international operations that can materially impact the company\u0092s short and long-term\nbottom-line.\n\nAffirm Political Non-Partisanship\n\nEmployees should not be put in a position where professional standing and goodwill within the corporation\ncould be jeopardized as a result of political beliefs.\nResponsible employment practices should protect workers from an environment characterized by political\nindoctrination or intimidation. Corporations should not devote resources to partisan political activities,\nnor should they compel their employees\nto contribute to or support particular causes. Moreover, it is wise for a corporation to maintain a\npolitically neutral stance as to avoid potentially embarrassing conflicts of interests that could negatively\nimpact the company\u0092s brand name\nwith consumers.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally support proposals\naffirming political non-partisanship within the company.\n\nPolitical Contributions, Lobbying Reporting & Disclosure\n\nChanges in legislation that governs corporate political giving have, rather than limiting such\ncontributions,\nincreased the complexity of tracking how much money corporations contribute to the political process and\nwhere that money ultimately ends up. In January 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court\u0092s decision in Citizens United\nvs. Federal Election Commission lifted restrictions on corporate spending in federal elections. A company\u0092s\ninvolvement in the political process could impact shareholder value if such activities are not properly\noverseen and managed.\n\nShareholders have the right to know about corporate political activities, and management\u0092s knowledge that\nsuch information can be made publicly available should\nencourage a company\u0092s lawful and responsible use of political contributions.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Given the significant reputational and financial risk involved in political giving, shareholders\nshould expect management to have\nthe necessary capabilities to monitor and track all monies distributed toward political groups and causes.\nThese internal controls should be fully consistent with Section 404 requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nof 2002.\n\nWhile political contributions, lobbying and other corporate political activity can benefit the strategic\ninterests of a company, it is important that accountability\nmechanisms are in place to ensure that monies disbursed in support of political objectives actually generate\nidentifiable returns on shareholder wealth. Such mechanisms serve to insure against the use of shareholder\nfunds in the furtherance of\nnarrow management agendas.\n\nWhen analyzing the proposals, special consideration will be made if the target company has been the subject\nof significant controversy\nstemming from its contributions or political activities, if the company fails to disclose a policy to\nshareholders that outlines the process by which the company considers its political contributions and\nlobbying activities, or if the company has\nrecently been involved in significant controversy or litigation related to the company\u0092s political\ncontributions or governmental affairs.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n

ENVIRONMENT & CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nShareholder proposals addressing environmental and energy concerns\nhave been plentiful in recent years, and generally seek greater disclosure on an issue or seek to improve a\ncompany\u0092s environmental practices in order to protect the world\u0092s natural resources. In addition, some\nproponents cite the negative\nfinancial implications for companies with poor environmental practices, including liabilities associated\nwith site clean-ups and lawsuits, as well as arguments that energy efficient products and clean\nenvironmental practices are sustainable business\npractices that will contribute to long-term shareholder value. Shareholders say the majority of independent\natmospheric scientists agree that global warming poses a serious problem to the health and welfare of all\ncountries, citing the findings of\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world\u0092s most authoritative scientific body on the\nsubject. Shareholder proponents argue that companies can report on their greenhouse gas emissions within a\nfew months at reasonable\ncost.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nScientists generally agree that gases released by chemical reactions including the burning of fossil fuels\ncontribute to a \u0093greenhouse effect\u0094 that traps\nthe planet\u0092s heat. Environmentalists claim that the greenhouse gases produced by the industrial age have\ncaused recent weather crises such as heat waves, rainstorms, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and\nreceding coastlines. With notable\nexceptions, a number of business leaders have described the rise and fall of global temperatures as\nnaturally occurring phenomena and depicted corporate impact on climate change as minimal.\n\nShareholder proposals asking a company to issue a report to shareholders \u0096 at reasonable cost and omitting\nproprietary information \u0096 on greenhouse gas\nemissions ask that the report include descriptions of efforts within companies to reduce emissions, their\nfinancial exposure and potential liability from operations that contribute to global warming, and their\ndirect or indirect efforts to promote\nthe view that global warming is not a threat. Proponents argue that there is scientific proof that the\nburning of fossil fuels causes global warming, that future legislation may make companies financially liable\nfor their contributions to global\nwarming, changing market dynamics and consumer preferences may impact demand for fossil fuels, and thus\nshareholder value, and that a report on the company\u0092s role in global warming can be assembled at reasonable\ncost.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Generally vote for shareholder proposals calling for a company to commit to reducing its greenhouse  \n  \u00a7    gas emissions under a                                                                                \n       reasonable timeline.                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally vote for resolutions requesting that a company disclose information on the financial,      \n  \u00a7    physical, or regulatory                                                                              \n       risks related to climate change on its operations and investments, or on how the company             \n       identifies, measures, and manages such risks.                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Increased use of renewable energy is expected to reduce the negative environmental\nimpact of energy companies. In addition, as supplies of oil and coal exist in the earth in limited\nquantities, renewable energy sources\nrepresent a competitive, and some would even argue essential, long-term business strategy.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally support shareholder proposals seeking increased\ninvestment in renewable energy sources, taking into account whether the terms of the resolution are\nrealistic or overly restrictive for management\nto pursue.\n\n17 Variations of this request also include climate transition related ambitions, or commitment to reporting\non the implementation of a climate plan.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Indeed, the term sustainability is complex and poses significant challenges for companies\non many levels. Many in the investment community have termed this broader responsibility the \u0093triple bottom\nline,\u0094 referring to the\ntriad of performance goals related to economic prosperity, social responsibility and environmental quality.\nIn essence, the concept requires companies to balance the needs and interests of their various stakeholders\nwhile operating in a manner that\nsustains business growth for the long-term, supports local communities and protects the environment and\nnatural capital for future generations.\n\nReporting and\nenhanced disclosure addressing sustainable development is important to companies namely because it offers a\nformal structure for decision making that helps management teams anticipate and address important global\ntrends that can have serious\nconsequences for business and society. Shareholders may request general sustainability reports on a specific\nlocation or operation, often requesting that the company detail the environmental, social, legal and other\nrisks and/or potential\nliabilities of the specific project in question.\n\nA number of companies have begun to report on sustainability issues using established standards in the\nmarketplace. Such reporting focuses on corporate compliance and measurement regarding key economic,\nenvironmental, and social performance indicators. As a best practice, companies release annual\nsustainability reports in conjunction to regular\nannual statement of operations.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally support\nshareholder proposals seeking greater disclosure on the company\u0092s environmental and social practices, and/or\nassociated risks and liabilities.\n                                                                                                            \n   Operations in Protected or Sensitive Areas                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nOperating in regions protected or established under\nnational or international categorization guidelines, including wildlife refuges, national forests, and\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) categorized areas, expose\ncompanies to increased oversight and the\npotential for associated risk and controversy. While it is important for a company to have the flexibility\nto operate in these regions to take advantage of strategic placement or growth, additional disclosure could\nbe an important mitigating factor\nto address increased risk and oversight. Restrictions to the company\u0092s operations, damaging public\nrelations, and costly litigation resulting from failure to comply with the requirements associated with\nprotected or categorized regions could\nhave a significant impact on shareholder value.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\nGenerally support shareholder requests for reports outlining potential environmental damage from operations\nin protected regions, including wildlife refuges, unless the company does not currently have operations or\nplans to develop operations in\nthese protected regions.\n\nHydraulic Fracturing\n\nShareholder proponents have elevated concerns on the use of hydraulic fracturing, an increasingly\ncontroversial process in which water, sand, and a mix of chemicals\nis blasted horizontally into tight layers of shale rock to extract natural gas. As this practice has gained\nmore widespread use, environmentalists have raised concerns that the chemicals mixed with sand and water to\naid the fracturing process can\ncontaminate ground water supplies. Proponents of resolutions at companies that employ hydraulic fracturing\nare also concerned that wastewater produced by the process could overload the waste treatment plants to\nwhich it is shipped. Shareholders have\nasked companies that utilize hydraulic fracturing to report on the environmental impact of the practice and\nto disclose policies designed to reduce hazards from the process.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for requests seeking greater transparency on the\npractice of hydraulic fracturing and its associated risks.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The Ceres Roadmap 2030, formulated by Ceres (formerly known as the\nCoalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, CERES), require signing companies to address\nenvironmental issues, including protection\nof the biosphere, sustainable use of natural resources, reduction and disposal of wastes, energy\nconservation, and employee and community risk reduction. A signatory to the Ceres Roadmap 2030 would\ndisclose its efforts in such areas through a\nstandardized report submitted to Ceres and made available to the public.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services supports proposals that improve a company\u0092s public\nimage, reduce exposure to liabilities, and establish standards so that environmentally responsible companies\nand markets are not at a competitive financial disadvantage.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Vote for requests asking a company to formally adopt the Ceres Roadmap 2030.  \n                                                                                     \n                                                                              \n  \u00a7    Vote for adoption of reports to shareholders on environmental issues.  \n                                                                              \nLand Use\n\nMany\nlarge retail stores and real estate development firms have received criticism over their policies and\nprocesses for acquiring and developing land. Often, in such cases, there are organizations that support as\nwell as those that oppose the proposed\ndevelopment.\n\nMany of these requests brought forth by the respective stakeholders raise serious issues that can have a\nreal impact on short-term shareholder\nvalue. However, in some cases, additional reporting may be duplicative of existing disclosure or may fail to\nprovide added benefit to shareholders commensurate with the associated cost or burden of providing\nadditional information. Some of the\ncompanies targeted with such resolutions have been subject to recent litigation, significant fines stemming\nfrom their land use practices, and/or recent community boycotts.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally support shareholder resolutions that request\nbetter disclosure of detailed information on a company\u0092s policies related to land use or development or\ncompliance with local and national laws and zoning requirements.\n\nWater Use\n\nShareholders may ask for a company to prepare a report evaluating the business risks linked to water use and\nimpacts on the company\u0092s supply chain, including\nsubsidiaries and bottling partners. Such proposals also ask companies to disclose current policies and\nprocedures for mitigating the impact of operations on local communities in areas of water scarcity.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for shareholder proposals seeking the preparation\nof a report on a company\u0092s risks linked to water use.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

WORKPLACE PRACTICES & HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity\n\nThese proposals generally request that a company establish a policy of reporting to shareholders its\nprogress with equal opportunity and affirmative action programs.\nThe costs of violating federal laws that prohibit discrimination by corporations are high and can affect\ncorporate earnings.\n\nThe Equal Opportunities Employment\nCommission (EEOC) does not release the company\u0092s filings to the public unless it is involved in litigation,\nand it is difficult to obtain from other sources. Companies need to be sensitive to minority employment\nissues as the work force becomes\nincreasingly diverse. This information can be provided with little cost to the company and does not create\nan unreasonable burden on management.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals calling for action on equal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination.  \n                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for proposals requesting legal and regulatory compliance and public reporting related to        \n  \u00a7    non-discrimination,                                                                                  \n       affirmative action, workplace health and safety, environmental issues, and labor policies and        \n       practices that affect long-term corporate performance.                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals advocating for non-discrimination in salary, wages, and all benefits.  \n                                                                                                 \nHigh-Performance Workplace\n\nHigh-performance workplace practices emphasize employee training, participation, and feedback. The concept\nof a high-performance workplace has been endorsed by the\nU.S. Department of Labor and refers to a workplace that is designed to provide workers with the information,\nskills, incentives, and responsibility to make decisions essential for innovation, quality improvement and\nrapid response to changes in the\nmarketplace. These standards embrace a \u0093what is good for the worker is good for the company\u0094 philosophy.\nStudies have shown that improvement in human resources practices is associated with increases in total\nreturn to shareholders.\nHigh-performance workplace standards proposals can include linking compensation to social measures such as\nemployee training, morale and safety, environmental performance and workplace lawsuits.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally support proposals that incorporate\nhigh-performance workplace standards.\n\nWorkplace Safety\n\nIn light of fatal accidents at oil refineries (Tesoro \u0096 Anacortes refinery, April 2010; and BP \u0096 Texas City\nrefinery, March 2005), the 2010 BP Deepwater\nHorizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico, and the explosion at Massey Energy\u0092s Upper Big Branch mine in 2010,\nshareholders have sought greater transparency and accountability regarding workplace safety by filing\nresolutions at a number of\ncorporations.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally vote for shareholder\nproposals requesting for workplace safety reports, including reports on accident risk reduction efforts.\n\nNon-Discrimination in Retirement Benefits\n\nA cash balance plan is a defined benefit plan that treats an earned retirement benefit as if it were a\ncredit from a defined contribution plan, but which provides a\nstated benefit at the end of its term. Because employer contributions to these plans are credited evenly\nover the life of a plan and not based on a seniority formula, they may reduce payouts to long-term employees\nwho are currently vested in plans.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

While significant policy reform is unlikely in the\nshort-term, business interests\nare worried enough that the National Association of Manufacturers and other pro-business lobbies have formed\na coalition on Capitol Hill to preserve the essential features of the plans and to overturn an IRS ruling.\n\nDriving the push behind conversions from traditional pension plans to cash-balance plans are the substantial\nsavings that companies generate in the process.

These\npredatory practices include: lending to borrowers with inadequate income, who will then default; not\nreporting on payment performances of borrowers to credit agencies; implying that credit life insurance is\nnecessary to obtain the loan (packing);\nunnecessarily high fees; refinancing with high additional fees rather than working out a loan that is in\narrears (flipping); and high prepayment fees.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                              \n  \u00a7    Support proposals calling for full compliance with fair-lending laws.  \n                                                                              \n                                                                \n  \u00a7    Support reporting on overall lending policies and data.  \n                                                                \nMacBride Principles\n\nThese resolutions have called for the adoption of the MacBride Principles for operations located in Northern\nIreland. They request companies operating abroad to\nsupport the equal employment opportunity policies that apply in facilities they operate domestically. The\nprinciples were established to address the sectarian hiring problems between Protestants and Catholics in\nNorthern Ireland. It is well\ndocumented that Northern Ireland\u0092s Catholic community faced much higher unemployment figures than the\nProtestant community. In response to this problem, the U.K. government instituted the New Fair Employment\nAct of 1989 (and subsequent\namendments) to address the sectarian hiring problems.\n\nMany companies believe that the Act adequately addresses the problems and that further action, including\nadoption of the MacBride Principles, only duplicates the efforts already underway. In evaluating a proposal\nto adopt the MacBride Principles, shareholders must decide whether the principles will cause companies to\ndivest, and therefore worsen the\nunemployment problem, or whether the principles will promote equal hiring practices. Proponents believe that\nthe Fair Employment Act does not sufficiently address the sectarian hiring problems.

These conditions include the use of\nslave, child, or prison labor, undemocratically elected governments, widespread reports by human rights\nadvocates, fervent pro-democracy\nprotests, or economic sanctions and boycotts.\n\nMany proposals refer to the seven core conventions, commonly referred to as the \u0093Declaration on Fundamental\nPrinciples and Rights At Work,\u0094 ratified by the International Labor Organization (ILO). The seven\nconventions fall under four broad categories: i) right to organize and bargain collectively; ii) non-\ndiscrimination in employment; iii) abolition\nof forced labor; and iv) end of child labor. Each member nation of the ILO body is bound to respect and\npromote these rights to the best of their abilities.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Support the principles and codes of conduct relating to company investment and/or operations in      \n  \u00a7    countries with patterns                                                                              \n       of human rights abuses or pertaining to geographic regions experiencing political turmoil (Northern  \n       Ireland, Columbia, Burma, former Soviet Union, and China).                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Support the implementation and reporting on ILO codes of conduct.  \n                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n       Support independent monitoring programs in conjunction with local and respected religious and human  \n  \u00a7    rights groups to                                                                                     \n       monitor supplier and licensee compliance with Codes.                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Support requests that a company conduct an assessment of the human rights risks in its operation or  \n  \u00a7    in its supply chain,                                                                                 \n       or report on its human rights risk assessment process.                                               \n                                                                                                            \nIV.

Current reporting\nrequirements for companies that operate nuclear facilities are managed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n(NRC) and include detailed reports on safety and security that are available to the public.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally support shareholder resolutions requesting\nthat companies report on risks associated with their nuclear reactor designs and/or the production and\ninterim storage of irradiated fuel rods.\n                                                                                                            \n   Concentrated Area Feeding Operations (CAFOs)                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nThe level of pollution resulting from CAFOs has drawn\nincreased attention in recent years as certain legal decisions have established the precedent that a company\ncan be held liable for the actions of the contract farms it sources from. Fines and remediation expenses\nstemming from these cases have been\nsignificant and could have a notable impact on the companies\u0092 operations and shareholder value.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally support resolutions requesting that companies\nreport to shareholders on the risks and liabilities associated with concentrated animal feeding operations\n(CAFOs) unless the company has publicly disclosed guidelines for its corporate and contract farming\noperations (including compliance\nmonitoring), or if the company does not directly source from CAFOs.\n\nPharmaceutical Product Reimportation\n\nOne of the most visible aspects of the legal and political debate over rising health care costs in the\nUnited States can be seen through prescription\ndrug reimportation through Canada. While U.S. and Canadian regulations limit reimportation, several states\nhave taken steps to encourage employees to actively seek less expensive medications through reimportation.\n\nShareholder action at major pharmaceutical companies has hinged around requesting increased disclosure of\nthe financial and legal risks associated with company\npolicies, or called on companies to change distribution limits to increase product availability in Canada,\nthereby encouraging product reimportation to the United States. The level of public concern over this issue\nand associated impact that a\npoorly developed policy could have on the companies suggest that additional disclosure of company policies\nrelated to reimportation could be beneficial to shareholders and generally merits support.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Generally support shareholder proposals requesting that companies report on the financial and legal  \n  \u00a7    impact of their                                                                                      \n       policies regarding prescription drug reimportation, unless such information is already publicly      \n       disclosed.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally support shareholder proposals requesting that companies adopt specific policies to         \n  \u00a7    encourage or not constrain                                                                           \n       prescription drug reimportation.                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nPharmaceutical Product Pricing\n\nPharmaceutical drug pricing, both within the United States and internationally, has raised many questions of\nthe companies that are responsible for creating and\nmarketing these treatments. Shareholder proponents, activists and even some legislators have called upon\ndrug companies to restrain pricing of prescription drugs.\n\nThe high cost of prescription drugs is a vital issue for senior citizens across the country. Seniors have\nthe greatest need for prescription drugs, accounting for a\nsignificant portion of all prescription drug sales, but they often live on fixed incomes and are\nunderinsured.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Pharmaceutical companies often respond that\nadopting a formal drug pricing\npolicy could put the company at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the AIDS crisis in Africa, many shareholders have called on companies to\naddress the issue of affordable drugs for the treatment of AIDS, as well as TB and Malaria throughout the\ndeveloping world. When analyzing such resolutions, consideration should be made of the strategic\nimplications of pricing policies in the\nmarket.\n\nTaft-Hartley Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Proposals asking a company to implement price restraints on its pharmaceutical products will be      \n  \u00a7    evaluated on a                                                                                       \n       case-by-case basis, taking into account the following factors:                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Whether the proposal focuses on a specific drug and region;  \n                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n       Whether the economic benefits of providing subsidized drugs (e.g., public goodwill) outweigh the     \n  \u00a7    costs in terms of                                                                                    \n       reduced profits, lower R&D spending, and harm to competitiveness;                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       The extent that reduced prices can be offset through the company\u0092s marketing expenditures without     \n  \u00a7    significantly                                                                                        \n       impacting R&D spending;                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Whether the company already limits price increases of its products;  \n                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Whether the company already contributes life-saving pharmaceuticals to the needy and Third World     \n       countries; and                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                       \n  \u00a7    The extent to which peer companies implement price restraints.  \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally support proposals requesting that companies implement specific price restraints for its    \n  \u00a7    pharmaceutical products                                                                              \n       in developing markets or targeting certain population groups.                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Generally support proposals requesting that companies evaluate their global product pricing          \n  \u00a7    strategy, considering the                                                                            \n       existing level of disclosure on pricing policies, any deviation from established industry pricing    \n       norms, and the company\u0092s existing philanthropic initiatives.                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals that call on companies to develop a policy to provide affordable      \n  \u00a7    HIV, AIDS, TB and Malaria                                                                            \n       drugs to citizens in the developing world.                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

In voting their shares, faith-based socially\nresponsible institutional shareholders are concerned not only with sustainable economic returns to\nshareholders and good corporate governance, but also with the ethical behavior of corporations and the\nsocial and environmental impact of their\nactions.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services has, therefore, developed faith-based proxy voting guidelines for Catholic and\nother Christian religious institutions that\nare consistent with the objectives of socially responsible shareholders as well as the teachings of\nCatholicism and Christianity as a whole. On matters of social and environmental impact, the guidelines seek\nto reflect a broad consensus of the\nfaith-based socially responsible investing community. Generally, we take as our frame of reference policies\nand proposals promulgated by the Catholic Bishops\u0092 Pastoral on economics, the Socially Responsible\nInvestment Guidelines adopted by the\nBishops, and the policies developed by members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR).\n\nOn matters of corporate governance, executive\ncompensation, and corporate structure, these faith-based proxy voting guidelines are based on a commitment\nto create and preserve economic value and to advance principles of best practice corporate governance and\nshareholder rights, consistent with\nresponsibilities to society and the environment as a whole.\n\nThe guidelines provide an overview of Catholic Advisory Services\u0092 faith-based proxy voting\npolicy for Catholic and other Christian denomination institutions. We note there may be cases in which the\nfinal vote recommendation varies from the vote guideline due to the fact that we closely examine the merits\nof each proposal and consider\nrelevant information and company-specific circumstances in arriving at our decisions. These guidelines are\nrevised on an annual basis to take into account emerging issues and trends on environmental, social and\ncorporate governance topics, as well\nas the evolution of market standards, regulatory changes and client feedback.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Board of Directors\n\nA corporation\u0092s board of directors sits at the apogee of the corporate governance system. Though they\nnormally delegate responsibility for the management of the\nbusiness to the senior executives they select and oversee, directors bear ultimate responsibility for the\nconduct of the corporation\u0092s business. The role of directors in publicly held corporations has undergone\nconsiderable change in recent\nyears. Once derided as rubber stamps for management, directors of public corporations today are expected to\nserve as effective guardians of shareholders\u0092 interests.\n\nVoting on directors and board-related issues is the most important use of the shareholder franchise, not\nsimply a routine proxy item. Although uncontested director\nelections do not present alternative nominees from whom to choose, a high percentage of opposition votes is\nan expression of shareholder dissatisfaction and should be sufficient to elicit a meaningful response from\nmanagement.\n\nThe role and responsibilities of directors has increasingly been the subject of much discussion and debate,\ngiven the current economic climate and the difficulties\nmany companies now face in their respective markets. Influential organizations, including the American Law\nInstitute, the American Bar Association, the National Association of Corporate Directors, and the Business\nRoundtable have issued reports and\nrecommendations regarding the duties and accountability of corporate boards. Both mainstream and alternative\nmedia outlets have highlighted the numerous gaps within risk oversight of company boards and individual\ndirectors, and many institutional\ninvestors, in response, have capitalized on their rights as stakeholders to prompt changes. Corporations\nhave taken notice, implementing many of the reforms championed by their shareholders.\n\nAlthough differences of opinion remain, a fairly strong consensus has emerged on a number of key issues. It\nis widely agreed that the board\u0092s most important\nresponsibility is to ensure that the corporation is managed in the shareholders\u0092 best long-term economic\ninterest. This will often require boards to consider the impact of their actions on other constituencies,\nincluding employees, customers,\nlocal communities, and the environment.\n                                                                                      \n  \u00a7    The board\u0092s principal functions are widely agreed to consist of the following:  \n                                                                                      \n                                                                                                          \n  \u00a7    To select, evaluate, and if necessary, replace management, including the chief executive officer;  \n                                                                                                          \n                                                                         \n  \u00a7    To review and approve major strategies and financial objectives;  \n                                                                         \n                                                    \n  \u00a7    To advise management on significant issues;  \n                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    To assure that effective controls are in place to safeguard corporate assets, manage risk, and       \n       comply with the law; and                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                         \n  \u00a7    To nominate directors and otherwise ensure that the board functions effectively.  \n                                                                                         \nBoards are expected to have a majority of directors independent of management. The independent directors are\nexpected to organize much of the board\u0092s work, even\nif the chief executive officer also serves as Chair of the board. Key committees of the board are expected\nto be entirely independent of management. It is expected that boards will engage in critical self-evaluation\nof themselves and of individual\nmembers. Individual directors, in turn, are expected to devote significant amounts of time to their duties,\nto limit the number of directorships they accept, and to own a meaningful amount of stock in companies on\nwhose boards they serve. Directors\nare ultimately responsible to the corporation\u0092s shareholders. The most direct expression of this\nresponsibility is the requirement that directors be elected to their positions by the shareholders.\nShareholders are also asked to vote on a number\nof other matters regarding the role, structure, and composition of the board. Catholic Advisory Services\nclassifies directors as either executive, non-independent non-executive, or independent directors.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

All appropriate\nnominees (except new) may be held\naccountable.\n\nRemoval of Shareholder Discretion on Classified Boards: The company has opted into,\nor failed to opt out of, state laws requiring a classified board structure.\n\n1 A \u0093new nominee\u0094 is a director who is being presented\nfor election by shareholders for the first time. Recommendations on new nominees who have served for less\nthan one year are made on a case-by-case basis depending on the timing of their appointment and the\nproblematic governance issue in question.\n\n2 In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use\n\u0093Withhold\u0094 as the contrary vote option in director elections; companies with a majority vote standard use\n\u0093Against\u0094. However, it will vary by company and the proxy must be checked to determine the valid contrary\nvote option for\nthe particular company.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

For private companies, the equivalent positions are\napplicable. A non-employee director serving as an officer due to statutory requirements (e.g. corporate\nsecretary) will generally be classified as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director under \u0093Any material\nrelationship with the company.\u0094 However, if the company provides explicit disclosure that the director is\nnot receiving additional compensation exceeding $10,000 per year for serving in that capacity, then the\ndirector will be classified as an Independent Director.\n\nii \u0093Affiliate\u0094 includes a subsidiary, sibling\ncompany, or parent company. Catholic Advisory Services uses 50 percent control ownership by the parent\ncompany as the standard for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor of an externally managed\nissuer (EMI) is considered an\naffiliate.\n\niii Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the company\u0092s\ninitial public offering (IPO).\n\niv When there is a former CEO of a special purpose\nacquisition company (SPAC) serving on the board of an acquired company, Catholic Advisory Services will\ngenerally classify such directors as independent unless determined otherwise taking into account the\nfollowing factors: the applicable listing\nstandards determination of such director\u0092s independence; any operating ties to the firm; and the existence\nof any other conflicting relationships or related party transactions.\n\nv Catholic Advisory Services will look at the terms of the interim officer\u0092s employment\ncontract to determine if it contains severance pay, long-term health and pension benefits, or other such\nstandard provisions typically contained in contracts of permanent, non-temporary CEOs. Catholic Advisory\nServices will also consider if a formal\nsearch process was under way for a full-time officer at the time.\n\nvi \u0093Immediate\nfamily member\u0094 follows the SEC\u0092s definition of such and covers spouses, parents, children, step-parents,\nstep-children, siblings, in-laws, and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of\nany director, nominee for\ndirector, executive officer, or significant shareholder of the company.\n\nvii\nProfessional services can be characterized as advisory in nature, generally involve access to sensitive\ncompany information or to strategic decision-making, and typically have a commission- or fee-based payment\nstructure. Professional services\ngenerally include, but are not limited to the following: investment banking/financial advisory services;\ncommercial banking (beyond deposit services); investment services; insurance services; accounting/audit\nservices; consulting services; marketing\nservices; legal services; property management services; realtor services; lobbying services; executive\nsearch services; and IT consulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional\nrelationships and not professional\nservices: deposit services; IT tech support services; educational services; and construction services. The\ncase of participation in a banking syndicate by a non-lead bank should be considered a transactional (and\nhence subject to the associated\nmateriality test) rather than a professional relationship. \u0093Of Counsel\u0094 relationships are only considered\nimmaterial if the individual does not receive any form of compensation (in excess of $10,000 per year) from,\nor is a retired partner\nof, the firm providing the professional service. The case of a company providing a professional service to\none of its directors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated, will be considered a\ntransactional rather than a\nprofessional relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be professional services\nunless the company explains why such services are not advisory.\n\nviii A material transactional relationship, including grants to non-profit organizations,\nexists if the company makes annual payments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity exceeding\nthe greater of $200,000 or 5 percent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues, in the case of a company which\nfollows NASDAQ listing standards;\nor the greater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues, in the case of a company which\nfollows NYSE listing standards. In the case of a company which follows neither of the preceding standards,\nCatholic Advisory Services\nwill apply the NASDAQ-based materiality test. (The recipient is the party receiving the financial proceeds\nfrom the transaction).\n\nix Dissident directors who are parties to a voting agreement pursuant to a settlement or similar arrangement\nmay be classified as Independent Directors if an analysis of the following factors\nindicates that the voting agreement does not compromise their alignment with all shareholders\u0092 interests:\nthe terms of the agreement; the duration of the standstill provision in the agreement; the limitations and\nrequirements of actions that\nare agreed upon; if the dissident director nominee(s) is subject to the standstill; and if there any\nconflicting relationships or related party transactions.\n\nx Interlocks include: executive officers serving as directors on each\nother\u0092s compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board); or\nexecutive officers sitting on each other\u0092s boards and at least one serves on the other\u0092s compensation or\nsimilar committees (or, in\nthe absence of such a committee, on the board).\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Although staggered boards can provide continuity for companies at the board level, there are also a\nnumber of downsides to the structure. First, a classified board can also be used to entrench management and\neffectively preclude most takeover\nbids or proxy contests. Board classification forces dissidents and would-be acquirers to negotiate with the\nincumbent board, which has the authority to decide on offers without a shareholder vote. In addition, when a\nboard is classified, it is\ndifficult to remove individual members for either poor attendance or poor performance; shareholders would\nonly have the chance to vote on a given director every third year when he or she comes up for election. The\nclassified board structure can also\nlimit shareholders\u0092 ability to withhold votes from inside directors that sit on key board committee, or to\nwithhold votes from an entire board slate to protest the lack of board diversity. According to ISS\u0092 2012\nBoard Practices study, the\nnumber of S&P 500 companies with classified boards has continued to fall. In 2015, only 17 percent of S&P\n500 companies maintained staggered boards, compared to 2 percent in 2014, 30 percent in 2013, 41 percent in\n2009 and 53 percent in\n2005. While we recognize that there are some advantages to classified boards, based on the latest studies on\nclassified boards, the fact that classified boards can make it more difficult for shareholders to remove\nindividual directors, and the fact\nthat classified boards can be used as an antitakeover device, Catholic Advisory Services recommends against\nthe adoption of classified boards.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals to repeal classified boards and to elect all directors annually.  \n                                                                                            \n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals to classify (stagger) the board of directors.  \n                                                                             \nMajority Vote Threshold for Director Elections\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for management proposals to adopt a majority of\nvotes cast standard for directors in uncontested elections.\n\nVote against if no carve-out for plurality in\ncontested elections is included.\n\nCumulative Voting\n\nMost corporations provide that shareholders are entitled to cast one vote for each share owned. Under a\ncumulative voting scheme the shareholder is permitted to have\none vote per share for each director to be elected. Shareholders are permitted to apportion those votes in\nany manner they wish among the director candidates. Shareholders have the opportunity to elect a minority\nrepresentative to a board through\ncumulative voting, thereby ensuring representation for all sizes of shareholders. For example, if there is a\ncompany with a ten-member board and 500 shares outstanding\u0097the total number of votes that may be cast is\n5,000.

Many companies have sought shareholder approval for charter or bylaw\namendments that would prohibit the removal of directors except for cause, thus ensuring that directors would\nretain their directorship for their\nfull-term unless found guilty of self-dealing. By requiring cause to be demonstrated through due process,\nmanagement insulates the directors from removal even if a director has been performing poorly, not attending\nmeetings, or not acting in the\nbest interests of shareholders.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals that provide that directors may be removed only for cause.  \n                                                                                          \n12 A proxy access right that meets the recommended guidelines.\n\n13 Indemnification: the condition of being secured against\nloss or damage.Limited liability: a person\u0092s financial liability is limited to a fixed sum, or personal\nfinancial assets are not at risk if the individual loses a lawsuit that results in financial award/damages\nto the plaintiff.\nExculpation: to eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director or officer to the corporation or its\nshareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Catholic\nAdvisory Services supports management proposals to fix the size of the board at a specific number, thus\npreventing management, when facing a proxy contest, from increasing the board size without shareholder\napproval. By increasing the size of the\nboard, management can make it more difficult for dissidents to gain control of the board.

Shareholders have expressed strong support for shareholder proposals on majority\nthreshold voting. Catholic Advisory Services believes shareholders should have a greater voice in the\nelection of directors and believes\nmajority threshold voting represents a viable alternative to the plurality system in the U.S. Companies are\nstrongly encouraged to also adopt a post-election policy (also known as a director resignation policy) that\nwill provide guidelines so that\nthe company will promptly address the situation of a holdover director.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for precatory and binding resolutions requesting that the\nboard change the company\u0092s bylaws to stipulate that directors need to be elected with an affirmative\nmajority of votes cast, provided it does not conflict with the state law where the company is incorporated.\nBinding resolutions need to allow for a carve-out for a plurality vote standard when there are more nominees\nthan board seats.\n\nMajority of Independent Directors\n\nCatholic Advisory Services believes that a board independent from management is of vital importance to a\ncompany and its shareholders. Accordingly, Catholic Advisory\nServices will cast votes in a manner that shall encourage the independence of boards.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The independence of key committees has been encouraged by regulation. Catholic\nAdvisory Services believes that initiatives to increase the independent representation of these committees\nor to require that these committees be\nindependent should be supported.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals asking that board audit,\ncompensation, and/or nominating committees be composed exclusively of independent directors.\n\nIndependent Board Chair\n\nOne of the principle functions of the board is to monitor and evaluate the performance of the CEO. The\nchairperson\u0092s duty to oversee management is obviously\ncompromised when he or she is required to monitor himself or herself; or when he or she is a non-independent\ndirector. Generally Catholic Advisory Services recommends a vote for shareholder proposals that would\nrequire that the position of board\nchair be held by an individual with no materials ties to the company other than their board seat.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals that would require the board chair\nto be independent of management.\n\nEstablishment of Board Committees\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for shareholder proposals to establish a new board\ncommittee to address broad corporate policy topics or to provide a forum for ongoing dialogue on issues such\nas the environment, human or labor rights, shareholder relations, occupational health and safety etc. when\nthe formation of such committees appears to be a potentially effective method of protecting or enhancing\nshareholder value. In evaluating such proposals, the following factors will be considered:\n                                                                                                            \n       Existing oversight mechanisms (including current committee structure) regarding the issue for which  \n  \u00a7    board oversight is                                                                                   \n       sought;                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Level of disclosure regarding the issue for which board oversight is sought;  \n                                                                                     \n                                                                                      \n  \u00a7    Company performance related to the issue for which board oversight is sought;  \n                                                                                      \n                                                                                                  \n  \u00a7    Board committee structure compared to that of other companies in its industry sector; and  \n                                                                                                  \n                                                 \n  \u00a7    The scope and structure of the proposal.  \n                                                 \nEstablish/Amend Nominee Qualifications\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on proposals that establish or amend director\nqualifications.

While it is recognized that the\ncompany is in the best position to evaluate the competence of\nthe outside accountants, we believe that outside accountants must ultimately be accountable to shareholders.\nA Blue Ribbon Commission report concluded that audit committees must improve their current level of\noversight of independent accountants.\nGiven the rash of accounting misdeeds that were not detected by audit panels or auditors, shareholder\nratification is an essential step in restoring investor confidence. Shareholders should have the right to\nweigh in on the choice of the audit firm,\nand all companies should put ratification on the ballot of their annual meeting.

Catholic Advisory Services believes that shareholders should have the ability to ratify the\nauditor on an annual basis.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                              \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to allow shareholders to vote on auditor ratification.  \n                                                                                              \n                                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals that ask a company to adopt a policy on auditor independence.  \n                                                                                         \n                                                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals that seek to limit the non-audit services provided by the company\u0092s auditor.  \n                                                                                                       \nAuditor Rotation\n\nTo minimize any conflict of interest that may rise between the company and its auditor, Catholic Advisory\nServices supports the rotation of auditors. Currently, SEC\nrules provide that partners should be rotated every five years. However, Catholic Advisory Services also\nbelieves that the long tenure of audit firms at U.S. companies can be problematic.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals to rotate company\u0092s auditor every\nfive years or more. Catholic Advisory Services believes that proposing a rotation period less than five\nyears is unreasonably restrictive and may negatively affect audit quality and service while increasing\nexpense.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Takeover Defenses / Shareholder Rights\n\nCorporate takeover attempts come in various guises. Usually, a would-be acquirer makes a direct offer to the\nboard of directors of a targeted corporation. The bidder\nmay offer to purchase the company for cash and/or stock. If the board approves the offer, a friendly\ntransaction is completed and presented to shareholders for approval. If, however, the board of directors\nrejects the bid, the acquirer can make a\ntender offer for the shares directly to the targeted corporation\u0092s shareholders. Such offers are referred to\nas hostile tender bids.\n\nNot wishing to wait\nuntil they are subjects of hostile takeover attempts, many corporations have adopted antitakeover measures\ndesigned to deter unfriendly bids or buy time. The most common defenses are the shareholders rights\nprotection plan, also known as the poison\npill, and charter amendments that create barriers to acceptance of hostile bids. In the U.S., poison pills\ndo not require shareholder approval. However, shareholders must approve charter amendments, such as\nclassified boards or supermajority vote\nrequirements. In brief, the very existence of defensive measures can foreclose the possibility of tenders\nand hence, opportunities to premium prices for shareholders.\n\nAnti-takeover statutes generally increase management\u0092s potential for insulating itself and warding off\nhostile takeovers that may be beneficial to shareholders.\nWhile it may be true that some boards use such devices to obtain higher bids and to enhance shareholder\nvalue, it is more likely that such provisions are used to entrench management. The majority of historical\nevidence on individual corporate\nanti-takeover measures indicates that heavily insulated companies generally realize lower returns than those\nhaving managements that are more accountable to shareholders and the market. The evidence also suggests that\nwhen states adopt their own\nanti-takeover devices, or endorse those employed by firms, shareholder returns are harmed. Moreover, the\nbody of evidence appears to indicate that companies in states with the strongest anti-takeover laws\nexperience lower returns than they would\nabsent such statutes.\n\nTakeover Defenses and Shareholder Rights-Related Management Proposals\n\nPoison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plans)\n\nPoison pills are corporate-sponsored financial devices that, when triggered by potential acquirers, do one\nor more of the following: 1) dilute the acquirer\u0092s\nequity holdings in the target company; 2) dilute the acquirer\u0092s voting interests in the target company; or\n3) dilute the acquirer\u0092s equity holdings in the post-merger company. Poison pills generally allow\nshareholders to purchase shares\nfrom, or sell shares back to, the target company (flip-in pill) and/or the potential acquirer (flip-out\npill) at a price far out of line with fair market value. Depending on the type of pill, the triggering event\ncan either transfer wealth from the\ntarget company or dilute the equity holdings of current shareholders. Poison pills insulate management from\nthe threat of a change in control and provide the target board with veto power over takeover bids. Because\npoison pills greatly alter the\nbalance of power between shareholders and management, shareholders should be allowed to make their own\nevaluation of such plans.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on management proposals on poison pill\nratification, focusing on the features of the shareholder rights plan. Rights plans should contain the\nfollowing attributes:\n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    No lower than a 20 percent trigger, flip-in or flip-over provision;  \n                                                                            \n                                            \n  \u00a7    A term of no more than three years;  \n                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    No deadhand, slowhand, no-hand or similar feature that limits the ability of a future board to       \n       redeem the pill;                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Shareholder redemption feature (qualifying offer clause); if the board refuses to redeem the pill    \n  \u00a7    90 days after a                                                                                      \n       qualifying offer is announced, 10 percent of the shares may call a special meeting or seek a         \n       written consent to vote on rescinding the pill; and                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

This has resulted in previously\nprofitable companies considering the adoption of a poison\npill and/or NOL protective amendment to protect their NOL tax assets, which may be lost upon an acquisition\nof 5 percent of a company\u0092s shares.\n\nWhen\nevaluating management proposals seeking to adopt NOL pills or protective amendments, the purpose behind the\nproposal, its terms, and the company\u0092s existing governance structure should be taken into account to assess\nwhether the structure\nactively promotes board entrenchment or adequately protects shareholder rights. While Catholic Advisory\nServices acknowledges the high estimated tax value of NOLs, which benefit shareholders, the ownership\nacquisition limitations contained in an NOL\npill/protective amendment coupled with a company\u0092s problematic governance structure could serve as an\nantitakeover device.\n\nGiven the fact that shareholders\nwill want to ensure that such an amendment does not remain in effect permanently, Catholic Advisory Services\nwill also closely review whether the pill/amendment contains a sunset provision or a commitment to cause the\nexpiration of the NOL\npill/protective amendment upon exhaustion or expiration of the NOLs.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote against proposals to adopt a poison pill for the stated\npurpose of protecting a company\u0092s net operating losses (\u0093NOLs\u0094) if the term of the pill would exceed the\nshorter of three years and the exhaustion of the NOL.\n\nVote case-by-case on management proposals for poison pill ratification, considering the following factors,\nif the term of the pill would be the shorter of three years (or less) and the exhaustion of the NOL:\n                                                                                                    \n  \u00a7    The ownership threshold to transfer (NOL pills generally have a trigger slightly below 5%);

These recent court decisions have encouraged companies to take a closer look at their bylaw\nprovisions to ensure that broad language does not provide loopholes for activist investors. Specifically,\ncompanies are including language\ndesigned to provide more detailed advance notice provisions and to ensure full disclosure of economic and\nvoting interests in a shareholder\u0092s notice of proposals, including derivatives and hedged positions.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on advance notice proposals, giving support to\nthose proposals which allow shareholders to submit proposals/nominations as close to the meeting date as\nreasonably possible and within the broadest window possible, recognizing the need to allow sufficient notice\nfor company, regulatory and shareholder review.\n\nTo be reasonable, the company\u0092s deadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/\nnominations must be no earlier than 120 days prior to the anniversary of the previous year\u0092s meeting and\nhave a submittal window of no shorter than 30 days from the beginning of the notice period (also known as a\n90-120 day window). The\nsubmittal window is the period under which a shareholder must file their proposals/nominations prior to the\ndeadline.\n\nIn general, support additional efforts by\ncompanies to ensure full disclosure in regard to a proponent\u0092s economic and voting position in the company\nso long as the informational requirements are reasonable and aimed at providing shareholders with the\nnecessary information to review\nsuch proposals.\n\n14 \u0093Unfettered\u0094 means no restrictions on agenda items, no\nrestrictions on the number of shareholders who can group together to reach the 10 percent threshold, and\nonly reasonable limits on when a meeting can be called: no greater than 30 days after the last annual\nmeeting and no greater than 90 prior to\nthe next annual meeting.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

In such a hostile takeover, the bidder offers cash for enough shares to gain\ncontrol of the target. At the same time the acquirer states that once control has been obtained, the\ntarget\u0092s remaining shares will be\npurchased with cash, cash and securities or only securities. Since the payment offered for the remaining\nstock is, by design less valuable than the original offer for the controlling shares, shareholders are\nforced to sell out early to maximize\ntheir value.

Since only the hostile\nparty receives payment, usually at a substantial premium over the market value of shares, the practice\ndiscriminates against most shareholders. This transferred cash, absent the greenmail payment, could be put\nto much better use for reinvestment in\nthe company, payment of dividends, or to fund a public share repurchase program.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for proposals to adopt antigreenmail charter or bylaw amendments or otherwise restrict a        \n  \u00a7    company\u0092s ability to                                                                                  \n       make greenmail payments.                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Review on a case-by-case basis antigreenmail proposals when they are bundled with other charter or   \n       bylaw amendments.                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nConfidential Voting\n\nConfidential voting, or voting by secret ballot, is one of the key structural issues in the proxy system. It\nensures that all votes are based on the merits of\nproposals and cast in the best interests of fiduciary clients and pension plan beneficiaries. In a\nconfidential voting system, only vote tabulators and inspectors of election may examine individual proxies\nand ballots; management and shareholders\nare given only vote totals. In an open voting system, management can determine who has voted against its\nnominees or proposals and then re-solicit those votes before the final vote count. As a result, shareholders\ncan be pressured to vote with\nmanagement at companies with which they maintain, or would like to establish, a business relationship.\nConfidential voting also protects employee shareholders from retaliation. Shares held by employee stock\nownership plans, for example, are\nimportant votes that are typically voted by employees.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\nVote for management proposals to adopt confidential voting.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Voting rights for those shares exceeding ownership limits may only be restored\nby approval of either a majority or supermajority of disinterested shares. Thus, control share acquisition\nstatutes effectively require a\nhostile bidder to put its offer to a shareholder vote or risk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder\ncontinues buying up a large block of shares.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing so would enable     \n  \u00a7    the completion of a                                                                                  \n       takeover that would be detrimental to shareholders.                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals to amend the charter to include control share acquisition provisions.  \n                                                                                                     \n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals to restore voting rights to the control shares.  \n                                                                           \nControl Share Cash-Out Provisions\n\nControl share cash-out statutes give dissident shareholders the right to \u0093cash-out\u0094 of their position in a\ncompany at the expense of the shareholder who has\ntaken a control position. In other words, when an investor crosses a preset threshold level, remaining\nshareholders are given the right to sell their shares to the acquirer, who must buy them at the highest\nacquiring price.\n\nC atholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for proposals to opt out of control share cash-out\nstatutes.\n\nDisgorgement Provisions\n\nDisgorgement provisions require an acquirer or potential acquirer of more than a certain percentage of a\ncompany\u0092s stock to disgorge, or pay back, to the company\nany profits realized from the sale of that company\u0092s stock purchased 24 months before achieving control\nstatus. All sales of company stock by the acquirer occurring within a certain period of time (between 18\nmonths and 24 months) prior to the\ninvestor\u0092s gaining control status are subject to these recapture-of-profits provisions.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for proposals to opt out of state disgorgement provisions.\n\nState Takeover Statutes\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote case-by-case on proposals to opt in or out of state\ntakeover statutes (including control share acquisition statutes, control share cash-out statutes, freezeout\nprovisions, fair price provisions, stakeholder laws, poison pill endorsements, severance pay and labor\ncontract provisions, antigreenmail\nprovisions, and disgorgement provisions).\n\nVote for opting into stakeholder protection statutes if they provide comprehensive protections for employees\nand\ncommunity stakeholders. Catholic Advisory Services would be less supportive of takeover statutes that only\nserve to protect incumbent management from accountability to shareholders and which negatively influence\nshareholder value.\n\nFreeze-Out Provisions\n\nFreeze-out provisions force an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a company to wait a\nspecified period of time before gaining control of the\ncompany.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The debate over antitakeover devices centers on whether these devices\nenhance or detract from shareholder value. One theory argues that a company\u0092s board, when armed with these\ntakeover protections, may use\nthem as negotiating tools to obtain a higher premium for shareholders. The opposing view maintains that\nmanagements afforded such protection are more likely to become entrenched than to actively pursue the best\ninterests of shareholders. Such\ntakeover defenses also serve as obstacles to the normal functioning of the marketplace which, when operating\nefficiently, should replace incapable and poorly performing managements.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for shareholder proposals that seek to remove\nantitakeover provisions.\n\nReimburse Proxy Solicitation Expenses\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote case-by-case on proposals to reimburse proxy\nsolicitation expenses. When voting in conjunction with support of a dissident slate, vote for the\nreimbursement of all appropriate proxy solicitation expenses associated with the election.\n\nVote for shareholder proposals calling for the reimbursement of reasonable costs incurred in connection with\nnominating one or more candidates in a contested election\nwhere the following apply:\n                                                                                                           \n  \u00a7    The election of fewer than 50 percent of the directors to be elected is contested in the election;  \n                                                                                                           \n                                                             \n  \u00a7    One or more of the dissident\u0092s candidates is elected;  \n                                                             \n                                                                              \n  \u00a7    Shareholders are not permitted to cumulate their votes for directors;  \n                                                                              \n                                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    The election occurred, and the expenses were incurred, after the adoption of this bylaw.  \n                                                                                                 \nVirtual Shareholder Meetings\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally vote for management proposals allowing for the\nconvening of shareholder meetings by electronic means, so long as they do not preclude in-person meetings.\nCompanies are encouraged to disclose the circumstances under which virtual-only15\nmeetings would be held, and to allow for comparable rights and opportunities for shareholders to participate\nelectronically as they would have during an in-person meeting.\n\n15 Virtual-only shareholder meeting\u0094 refers to a meeting of shareholders that is held exclusively using\ntechnology without a corresponding in-person meeting.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Miscellaneous Governance Provisions\n\nBundled Proposals\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Review on a case-by-case basis bundled or\n\u0093conditional\u0094 proxy proposals. In the case of items that are conditioned upon each other, examine the\nbenefits and costs of the packaged items. In instances where the joint effect of the conditioned items is\nnot in shareholders\u0092 best\ninterests, vote against the proposals. If the combined effect is positive, support such proposals.\n\nAdjourn Meeting\n\nCompanies may ask shareholders to adjourn a meeting in order to solicit more votes. Generally, shareholders\nalready have enough information to\nmake their vote decisions. Once their votes have been cast, there is no justification for spending more\nmoney to continue pressing shareholders for more votes.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Generally vote against proposals to provide management with the authority to adjourn an annual or    \n  \u00a7    special meeting absent                                                                               \n       compelling reasons to support the proposal.                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for proposals that relate specifically to soliciting votes for a merger or transaction if       \n  \u00a7    supporting that merger or                                                                            \n       transaction.

Capital Structure\n\nThe equity in a corporate enterprise (that is, the residual value of the company\u0092s assets after the payment\nof all debts) belongs to the shareholders. Equity\nsecurities may be employed, or manipulated, in a manner that will ultimately enhance or detract from\nshareholder value. As such, certain actions undertaken by management in relation to a company\u0092s capital\nstructure can be of considerable\nsignificance to shareholders. Changes in capitalization usually require shareholder approval or\nratification.\n\nCommon Stock Authorization\n\nState statutes and stock exchanges require shareholder approval for increases in the number of common\nshares. Corporations increase their supply of common stock for a\nvariety of ordinary business purposes: raising new capital, funding stock compensation programs, business\nacquisitions, and implementation of stock splits or payment of stock dividends.\n\nGeneral Authorization Requests\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote case-by-case on proposals to increase the number of\nauthorized shares of common stock that are to be used:\n                                                                                                            \n       If share usage (outstanding plus reserved) is less than 50% of the current authorized shares, vote   \n  \u00a7    for an increase of up                                                                                \n       to 50% of current authorized shares.                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       If share usage is 50% to 100% of the current authorized, vote for an increase of up to 100% of       \n  \u00a7    current authorized                                                                                   \n       shares.                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    If share usage is greater than current authorized shares, vote for an increase of up to the current  \n       share usage.                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       In the case of a stock split, the allowable increase is calculated (per above) based on the          \n  \u00a7    post-split adjusted                                                                                  \n       authorization.                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nGenerally vote against proposed increases, even if within the above ratios, if the proposal or the company\u0092s\nprior or\nongoing use of authorized shares is problematic, including, but not limited to:\n                                                                                                            \n       The proposal seeks to increase the number of authorized shares of the class of common stock that     \n  \u00a7    has superior voting                                                                                  \n       rights to other share classes;

Increasing share price\nis sometimes necessary to restore a company\u0092s share\nprice to a level that will allow it to be traded on the national stock exchanges.

The purpose of\npar value stock is to establish the maximum responsibility\nof a stockholder in the event that a corporation becomes insolvent. Proposals to reduce par value come from\ncertain state level requirements for regulated industries such as banks, and other legal requirements\nrelating to the payment of dividends.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for management proposals to reduce the par value of common stock unless the action is being     \n  \u00a7    taken to facilitate an                                                                               \n       anti-takeover device or some other negative corporate governance action.                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                              \n  \u00a7    Vote for management proposals to eliminate par value.  \n                                                              \nUnequal Voting Rights/Dual Class Structure\n\nIncumbent managers use unequal voting rights with the voting rights of their common shares superior to other\nshareholders in order to concentrate their power and\ninsulate themselves from the wishes of the majority of shareholders. Dual class exchange offers involve a\ntransfer of voting rights from one group of shareholders to another group of shareholders typically through\nthe payment of a preferential\ndividend. A dual class recapitalization also establishes two classes of common stock with unequal voting\nrights, but initially involves an equal distribution of preferential and inferior voting shares to current\nshareholders.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally vote against proposals to create a new class of\ncommon stock unless:\n                                                                                                            \n       The company discloses a compelling rationale for the dual-class capital structure, including: a)     \n  \u00a7    the company\u0092s                                                                                         \n       auditor has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the company\u0092s ability to continue as a    \n       going concern; or b) the new class of shares will be transitory;                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

The absence of these rights could cause stockholders\u0092 interest in a company to be reduced by the\nsale of additional shares without\ntheir knowledge and at prices unfavorable to them. Preemptive rights, however, can make it difficult for\ncorporations to issue large blocks of stock for general corporate purposes. Both corporations and\nshareholders benefit when corporations are\nable to arrange issues without preemptive rights that do not result in a substantial transfer of control.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Review on a case-by-case basis proposals to create or\nabolish preemptive rights. In evaluating proposals on preemptive rights, we look at the size of a company,\nthe characteristics of its shareholder base and the liquidity of the stock.\n\nDebt Restructurings\n\nProposals to increase common and/or preferred shares and to issue shares as part of a debt-restructuring\nplan will be analyzed considering the following issues:\n                                                                                                            \n       Dilution: How much will the ownership interest of existing shareholders be reduced, and how extreme  \n  \u00a7    will                                                                                                 \n       dilution to any future earnings be?                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Change in Control: Will the transaction result in a change in control/management at the company?     \n  \u00a7    Are board                                                                                            \n       and committee seats guaranteed?

Executive and Director Compensation\n\nThe global financial crisis resulted in significant erosion of shareholder value and highlighted the need\nfor greater assurance that executive compensation is\nprincipally performance-based, fair, reasonable, and not designed in a manner that would incentivize\nexcessive risk-taking by managements. The financial crisis raised questions about the role of pay incentives\nin influencing executive behavior and\nmotivating inappropriate or excessive risk-taking that could threaten a corporation\u0092s long-term viability.\nThe safety lapses that led to the disastrous explosions at BP\u0092s Deepwater Horizon oil rig and Massey\nEnergy\u0092s Upper Big Branch\nmine, and the resulting unprecedented losses in shareholder value; a) underscore the importance of\nincorporating meaningful economic incentives around social and environmental considerations in compensation\nprogram design, and b) exemplify the\ncostly liabilities of failing to do so.\n\nEvolving disclosure requirements have opened a wider window into compensation practices and processes,\ngiving\nshareholders more opportunity and responsibility to ensure that pay is designed to create and sustain value.\nCompanies in the U.S. are now required to evaluate and discuss potential risks arising from misguided or\nmisaligned compensation programs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires advisory shareholder votes on\nexecutive compensation (management \u0093say on pay\u0094), an advisory vote on the frequency of say on pay, as well\nas a shareholder advisory vote\non golden parachute compensation. The advent of \u0093say on pay\u0094 votes for shareholders in the U.S. has provided\na new communication mechanism and impetus for constructive engagement between shareholders and\nmanagers/directors on pay issues.\n\nThe socially responsible investing community contends that corporations should be held accountable for their\nactions and decisions, including those around\nexecutive compensation. Catholic Advisory Services believes that executive pay programs should be fair,\ncompetitive, reasonable, and create appropriate incentives, and that pay for performance should be a central\ntenet in executive compensation\nphilosophy. Most investors expect corporations to adhere to certain best practice pay considerations in\ndesigning and administering executive and director compensation programs, including:\n                                                                                                            \n       Appropriate pay-for-performance alignment with emphasis on long-term shareholder value: executive    \n       pay                                                                                                  \n       practices must be designed to attract, retain, and appropriately motivate the key employees who      \n  \u00a7    drive shareholder value creation over the long term.

This non-binding\nshareholder vote on compensation must be included in a proxy or consent or authorization at least once every\nthree years.\n\nIn general, the Say on Pay ballot item is the primary focus of voting on executive pay practices \u0096\ndissatisfaction with compensation practices can be expressed\nby voting against the Say on Pay proposal rather than voting against or withhold from the compensation\ncommittee. However, if there is no Say on Pay on the ballot, then the negative vote will apply to members of\nthe compensation committee. In\naddition, in egregious cases, or if the board fails to respond to concerns raised by a prior Say on Pay\nproposal, then Catholic Advisory Services will recommend vote against or withhold votes from compensation\ncommittee members (or, if the full\nboard is deemed accountable, all directors). If the negative factors involve equity-based compensation, then\na vote against an equity-based plan proposal presented for shareholder approval may be appropriate. In\nevaluating Say on Pay proposals,\nCatholic Advisory Services will also assess to what degree social and environmental considerations are\nincorporated into compensation programs and executive pay decision-making \u0096 to the extent that proxy\nstatement Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis (CD&A) disclosures permit.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Evaluate\nexecutive pay and practices, as well as certain aspects of outside director compensation on a case-by-case\nbasis.\n                                                               \n  \u00a7    Vote against management Say on Pay (\u0093SOP\u0094) proposals if:  \n                                                               \n                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    There is an unmitigated misalignment between CEO pay and company performance  \n       (pay-for-performance);                                                        \n                                                                                     \n                                                         \n  \u00a7    The company maintains problematic pay practices;  \n                                                         \n                                                                                           \n  \u00a7    The board exhibits a significant level of poor communication and responsiveness to  \n       shareholders.                                                                       \n                                                                                           \n                                                                \n  W W W .

The SOP is at\nits essence a\ncommunication vehicle, and communication is most useful when it is received in a consistent and timely\nmanner. Catholic Advisory Services supports an annual SOP vote for many of the same reasons it supports\nannual director elections rather than a\nclassified board structure: because this provides the highest level of accountability and direct\ncommunication by enabling the SOP vote to correspond to the majority of the information presented in the\naccompanying proxy statement for the applicable\nshareholders\u0092 meeting. Having SOP votes every two or three years, covering all actions occurring between the\nvotes, would make it difficult to create the meaningful and coherent communication that the votes are\nintended to provide. Under\ntriennial elections, for example, a company would not know whether the shareholder vote references the\ncompensation year being discussed or a previous year, making it more difficult to understand the\nimplications of the vote.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for annual advisory votes on compensation, which\nprovide the most consistent and clear communication channel for shareholder concerns about companies\u0092\nexecutive pay programs.\n\nAdvisory Vote on Golden Parachutes in an Acquisition, Merger, Consolidation, or Proposed Sale\n\nThis is a proxy item regarding specific advisory\nvotes on \u0093golden parachute\u0094 arrangements for Named Executive Officers (NEOs) that is required under The\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Catholic Advisory Services places particular\nfocus on severance packages\nthat provide inappropriate windfalls and cover certain tax liabilities of executives.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote case-by-case on say on Golden Parachute proposals, including\nconsideration of existing change-in-control arrangements maintained with named executive officers rather\nthan focusing primarily on new or extended\narrangements.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

However, the\npresence of multiple legacy problematic features will also be closely scrutinized.\n\nIn cases where the golden parachute vote is incorporated into a company\u0092s\nadvisory vote on compensation (\u0093management \u0093say on pay\u0094), Catholic Advisory Services will evaluate the \u0093say\non pay\u0094 proposal in accordance with these guidelines, which may give higher weight to that component of the\noverall\nevaluation.\n\nEquity-Based Incentive Plans\n\nAs executive pay levels continue to soar, non-salary compensation remains one of the most sensitive and\nvisible corporate governance issues. The financial crisis\nraised questions about the role of pay incentives in influencing executive behavior, including their\nappetite for risk-taking. Although shareholders may have little say about how much the CEO is paid in salary\nand bonus, they do have a major voice\nin approving stock incentive plans.\n\nStock-based plans can transfer significant amounts of wealth from shareholders to executives and directors\nand are among the\nmost economically significant issues that shareholders are entitled to vote on. Rightly, the cost of these\nplans must be in line with the anticipated benefits to shareholders. Clearly, reasonable limits must be set\non dilution as well as\nadministrative authority. In addition, shareholders must consider the necessity of the various pay programs\nand examine the appropriateness of award types. Consequently, the pros and cons of these proposals\nnecessitate a case-by-case evaluation.\n\nFactors that increase the cost (or have the potential to increase the cost) of plans to shareholders\ninclude: excessive dilution, options awarded at below-market\ndiscounts, permissive policies on pyramiding, restricted stock giveaways that reward tenure rather than\nresults, sales of shares on concessionary terms, blank-check authority for administering committees, option\nrepricing or option replacements,\naccelerated vesting of awards in the event of defined changes in corporate control, stand-alone stock\nappreciation rights, loans or other forms of assistance, or evidence of improvident award policies.\n\nPositive plan features that can offset costly features include: plans with modest dilution potential (i.e.\nappreciably below double-digit levels), bars to pyramiding\nand related safeguards for investor interests. Also favorable are performance programs with a duration of\ntwo or more years, bonus schemes that pay off in non-dilutive, fully deductible cash, 401K and other thrift\nor profit sharing plans, and\ntax-favored employee stock purchase plans. In general, we believe that stock plans should afford incentives,\nnot sure-fire, risk-free rewards.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

SVT is expressed as both a\ndollar amount and as a percentage of market value, and includes the new shares proposed, shares available\nunder existing plans, and shares\ngranted but unexercised (using two measures, in the case of plans subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard\nevaluation, as noted above). All award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are placed on\nthe most expensive types of awards\n(for example, full value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be granted will be the most\nexpensive types. See discussion of specific types of awards.\n\n20 Proposals evaluated under the EPSC policy generally include those to approve or amend (1) stock option\nplans for employees and/or employees and directors, (2) restricted stock\nplans for employees and/or employees and directors, and (3) omnibus stock incentive plans for employees\nand/or employees and directors.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are established based on these top performers\u0092\nhistoric SVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most strongly\ncorrelated to SVT. The benchmark\nindustry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the specific company by plugging the company-\nspecific performance measures, size and cash compensation into the industry cap equations to arrive at the\ncompany\u0092s benchmark.21\n\nRepricing Provisions\n\nVote against plans that expressly permit the repricing or exchange of underwater stock options/stock\nappreciate rights (SARs) without prior\nshareholder approval. \u0093Repricing\u0094 includes the ability to do any of the following:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Amend the terms of outstanding options or SARs to reduce the exercise price of such outstanding      \n       options or SARs;                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Cancel outstanding options or SARs in exchange for options or SARs with an exercise price that is    \n  \u00a7    less than the exercise                                                                               \n       price of the original options or SARs;                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                \n  \u00a7    The cancellation of underwater options in exchange for stock awards; or  \n                                                                                \n                                            \n  \u00a7    Cash buyouts of underwater options.  \n                                            \nWhile the above cover most types of repricing, Catholic Advisory Services may view other provisions as akin\nto repricing depending on the facts and circumstances.\n\nAlso, vote against or withhold from members of the compensation committee who approved repricing (as defined\nabove or otherwise determined by Catholic Advisory\nServices) without prior shareholder approval, even if such repricings are allowed in their equity plan.\n\nVote against plans that do not expressly prohibit\nrepricing or cash buyout of underwater options without shareholder approval if the company has a history of\nrepricing/buyouts without shareholder approval, and the applicable listing standards would not preclude them\nfrom doing so.\n\nPay-for-Performance Misalignment \u0096 Application to Equity Plans\n\nIf the equity plan on the ballot is a vehicle for , vote against the plan.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services may recommend a vote against the equity plan if the plan is determined to\nbe a vehicle for pay-for-performance misalignment. Considerations in voting against the equity plan may\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n                                                          \n  \u00a7    Severity of the pay-for-performance misalignment;  \n                                                          \n                                                                                        \n  \u00a7    Whether problematic equity grant practices are driving the misalignment; and/or  \n                                                                                        \n                                                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Whether equity plan awards have been heavily concentrated to the CEO and/or the other NEOs.  \n                                                                                                    \nThree-Year Value Adjusted Burn Rate\n\nA \u0093Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\u0094 is used for stock plan evaluations. Value-Adjusted Burn Rate benchmarks will be\ncalculated as the greater of: (1) an\nindustry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the company\u0092s GICS group segmented by S&P\n500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&P 500) and non-Russell 3000 index; and (2) a de minimis threshold\nestablished\nseparately for each of the S&P 500, the Russell 3000 index less the S&P 500, and the non-Russell 3000 index.\nYear-over-year burn-rate benchmark changes will be limited to a predetermined range above or below the prior\nyear\u0092s burn-rate\nbenchmark.\n\n21 For plans evaluated under the Equity Plan Scorecard policy, the company\u0092s SVT benchmark is considered\nalong with other factors.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Over\nthe long term, stock prices are an excellent indicator of management performance. However, other factors,\nsuch as economic conditions and investor reaction to the stock market in general and certain industries in\nparticular, can greatly impact the\ncompany\u0092s stock price. As a result, a cash bonus plan can effectively reward individual performance and the\nachievement of business unit objectives that are independent of short-term market share price fluctuations.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on amendments to cash and equity incentive\nplans.\n\nGenerally vote for proposals to amend executive cash, stock, or cash and stock incentive plans if the\nproposal:\n                                                   \n  \u00a7    Addresses administrative features only; or  \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n       Seeks approval for Section\u00a0162(m) purposes only, and the plan administering committee consists       \n       entirely of                                                                                          \n       independent directors, per Catholic Advisory Services\u0092 Classification of Directors.

However, purchase plans are beneficial\nonly when they are well balanced and in the best interests of all shareholders. From a shareholder\u0092s\nperspective, plans with offering periods of 27 months or less are preferable. Plans with longer offering\nperiods remove too much of the market\nrisk and could give participants excessive discounts on their stock purchases that are not offered to other\nshareholders.\n\nQualified Plans\n\nQualified employee stock purchase plans qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the\nInternal Revenue Code.\nSuch plans must be broad-based, permitting all full-time employees to participate. Some companies also\npermit part-time staff to participate. Qualified ESPPs must be expensed under SFAS 123 unless the plan meets\nthe following conditions; a) purchase\ndiscount is 5 percent or below; b) all employees can participate in the program; and 3) no look-back feature\nin the program. Therefore, some companies offer nonqualified ESPPs.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on qualified employee stock purchase plans.

Also, limits are placed on employees\u0092\ncontributions. Some companies provide a maximum dollar value for the year and others specify the limits in\nterms of a percent of base salary, excluding bonus or commissions. For plans that do not qualify under\nSection 423 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, a plan participant will not recognize income by participating in the plan, but will recognize\nordinary compensation income for federal income tax purposes at the time of the purchase.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on nonqualified employee stock purchase plans.\nVote for nonqualified employee stock purchase plans with all the following features:\n                                                                                                            \n       Broad-based participation (i.e., all employees of the company with the exclusion of individuals      \n  \u00a7    with 5 percent or more of                                                                            \n       beneficial ownership of the company);                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Limits on employee contribution, which may be a fixed dollar amount or expressed as a percent of     \n       base salary;                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

The plans are designed to\ndefer a portion of current employee income for retirement purposes.\n\nThe primary difference between ESOPs and other employee benefit plans is that ESOPs invest primarily in the\nsecurities of the employee\u0092s company. In addition, an\nESOP must be created for the benefit of non-management level employees and administered by a trust that\ncannot discriminate in favor of highly paid personnel.\n\nAcademic research of the performance of ESOPs in closely held companies found that ESOPs appear to increase\noverall sales, employment, and sales per employee over\nwhat would have been expected absent an ESOP. Studies have also found that companies with an ESOP are also\nmore likely to still be in business several years later, and are more likely to have other retirement\noriented benefit plans than comparable\nnon-ESOP companies.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for proposals to implement an ESOP or increase authorized\nshares for existing ESOPs, unless the number of shares allocated to the ESOP is excessive (more than five\npercent of outstanding shares).\n\nOption Exchange Programs/Repricing Options\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on management proposals seeking approval to\nexchange/reprice options taking into consideration:\n                                                                                                            \n       Historic trading patterns \u0096 the stock price should not be so volatile that the options are likely to  \n  \u00a7    be back                                                                                              \n       \u0093in-the-money\u0094 over the near term;                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                              \n  \u00a7    Rationale for the re-pricing \u0096 was the stock price decline beyond management\u0092s control?  \n                                                                                              \n                                            \n  \u00a7    Is this a value-for-value exchange?  \n                                            \n                                                                      \n  \u00a7    Are surrendered stock options added back to the plan reserve?  \n                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Timing--repricing should occur at least one year out from any precipitous drop in company\u0092s stock     \n       price;                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Option vesting \u0096 does the new option vest immediately or is there a black-out period?  \n                                                                                             \n                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Term of the option \u0096 the term should remain the same as that of the replaced option;  \n                                                                                            \n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Exercise price \u0096 should be set at fair market or a premium to market;  \n                                                                             \n                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Participants \u0096 executive officers and directors must be excluded.  \n                                                                         \nIf the surrendered options are added back to the equity plans for re-issuance, then also take into\nconsideration the company\u0092s total cost of equity plans and its\nthree-year average burn rate.\n\nIn addition to the above considerations, evaluate the intent, rationale, and timing of the repricing\nproposal.

A 401(k) plan is any\nqualified plan\nunder Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code that contains a cash or deferred arrangement. In its\nsimplest form, an employee can elect to have a portion of his salary invested in a 401(k) plan before any\nincome taxes are assessed. The\nmoney can only be withdrawn before retirement under penalty. However, because the money contributed to the\nplan is withdrawn before taxes (reducing the employee\u0092s income tax), a properly planned 401(k) plan will\nenable an employee to make\nlarger contributions to a 401(k) plan than to a savings plan, and still take the same amount home.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for proposals to implement a 401(k) savings plan for\nemployees.\n\nSeverance Agreements for Executives/Golden Parachutes\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals to ratify or cancel\ngolden parachutes.

Change in control is defined as   \n       a change in the company ownership structure.                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nDirector Compensation\n\nThe board\u0092s legal charge of fulfilling its fiduciary obligations of loyalty and care is put to the ultimate\ntest through the task of the board setting its own\ncompensation. Directors themselves oversee the process for evaluating board performance and establishing pay\npackages for board members.\n\nShareholders provide\nlimited oversight of directors by electing individuals who are primarily selected by the board, or a board\nnominating committee, and by voting on stock-based plans for directors designed by the board compensation\ncommittee. Additionally,\nshareholders may submit and vote on their own resolutions seeking to limit or restructure director pay.\nWhile the cost of compensating non-employee directors is small in absolute terms, compared to the cost of\ncompensating executives, it is still a\ncritical aspect of a company\u0092s overall corporate governance structure.\n\nOverall, director pay levels are rising in part because of the new forms of pay in\nuse at many companies, as well as because of the increased responsibilities arising from the 2002 Sarbanes-\nOxley Act requirements. In addition to an annual retainer fee, many companies also pay fees for attending\nboard and committee meetings, fees\nfor chairing a committee, or a retainer fee for chairing a committee.\n\nDirector compensation packages should be designed to provide value to directors for their\ncontribution. Given that many directors are high-level executives whose personal income levels are generally\nhigh, cash compensation may hold little appeal. Stock-based incentives on the other hand reinforce the\ndirectors\u0092 role of protecting\nand enhancing shareholder value. The stock-based component of director compensation should be large enough\nto ensure that when faced with a situation in which the interests of shareholders and management differ, the\nboard will have a financial\nincentive to think as a shareholder. Additionally, many companies have instituted equity ownership programs\nfor directors. Catholic Advisory Services recommends that directors receive stock grants equal to three\ntimes of their annual retainer, as it\nis a reasonable starting point for companies of all sizes and industries. A vesting schedule for director\ngrants helps directors to meet the stock ownership guidelines and maintains their long-term interests in the\nfirm.\n\nDirector compensation packages should also be designed to attract and retain competent directors who are\nwilling to risk becoming a defendant in a lawsuit and suffer\npotentially adverse publicity if the company runs into financial difficulties or is mismanaged.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Companies\nalso disclose their compensation practices and details of their stock-based compensation plans. While this\nlevel of disclosure is helpful, it does not always provide a comprehensive picture of the company\u0092s\ncompensation practices. For\nshareholders to make informed decisions on compensation levels, they need to have clear, concise information\nat their disposal. Increased disclosure will help ensure that management: (1) has legitimate reasons for\nsetting specific pay levels;\nand (2) is held accountable for its actions.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals seeking increased disclosure on\nexecutive compensation issues including the preparation of a formal report on executive compensation\npractices and policies.\n\nLimit Executive Compensation\n\nProposals that seek to limit executive or director compensation usually focus on the absolute dollar figure\nof the compensation or focus on the ratio of compensation\nbetween the executives and the average worker of a specific company. Proponents argue that the exponential\ngrowth of executive salaries is not in the best interests of shareholders, especially when that pay is\nexorbitant when compared to the\ncompensation of other workers.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for proposals to prepare reports seeking to compare the wages of a company\u0092s lowest paid worker  \n  \u00a7    to the highest                                                                                       \n       paid workers.                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote case-by-case on proposals that seek to establish a fixed ratio between the company\u0092s lowest      \n  \u00a7    paid workers and                                                                                     \n       the highest paid workers.                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nStock Ownership Requirements\n\nCorporate directors should own some amount of stock of the companies on which they serve as board members.\nStock ownership is a simple method to align the interests\nof directors with company shareholders. Nevertheless, many highly qualified individuals such as academics\nand clergy who can offer valuable perspectives in boardrooms may be unable to purchase individual shares of\nstock. In such a circumstance, the\npreferred solution is to look at the board nominees individually and take stock ownership into consideration\nwhen voting on the merits of each candidate.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote against shareholder proposals that mandate a\nminimum amount of stock that directors must own in order to qualify as a director or to remain on the board.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Catholic Advisory Services does not support repricing\nsince it undermines the incentive purpose of the plan. The use of options as an incentive means that\nemployees must bear the same risks as shareholders in holding these options. Shareholder resolutions calling\non companies to abandon the practice of\nrepricing or to submit repricings to a shareholder vote will be supported.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                   \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals seeking to limit repricing.  \n                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals asking the company to have option repricings submitted for            \n       shareholder ratification.                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nSeverance Agreements/Golden Parachutes\n\nGolden parachutes are designed to protect the employees of a corporation in the event of a change in\ncontrol. With Golden Parachutes senior level management employees\nreceive a payout during a change in control at usually two to three times base salary.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals requiring that golden parachutes or\nexecutive severance agreements be submitted for shareholder ratification, unless the proposal requires\nshareholder approval prior to entering into employment contracts.\n\nCash Balance Plans\n\nA cash balance plan is a defined benefit plan that treats an earned retirement benefit as if it was a credit\nfrom a defined contribution plan, but which provides a\nstated benefit at the end of its term. Because employer contributions to these plans are credited evenly\nover the life of a plan, and not based on a seniority formula they may reduce payouts to long-term employees\nwho are currently vested in plans.\n\nCash-balance pension conversions have undergone congressional and federal agency scrutiny following high-\nprofile EEOC complaints on age discrimination and\nemployee anger at companies like IBM. While significant change is unlikely in the short-tm, business\ninterests were concerned enough that the National Association of Manufacturers and other business lobbies\nformed a Capitol Hill coalition to\npreserve the essential features of the plans and to overturn a IRS ruling. Driving the push behind\nconversions from traditional pension plans to cash-balance plans are the substantial savings that companies\ngenerate in the process. Critics point out\nthat these savings are gained at the expense of the most senior employees. Resolutions call on corporate\nboards to establish a committee of outside directors to prepare a report to shareholders on the potential\nimpact of pension-related proposals\nnow being considered by national policymakers in reaction to the controversy spawned by the plans.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                              \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals calling for non-discrimination in retirement benefits.  \n                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking a company to give employees the option of electing to          \n  \u00a7    participate in either a cash                                                                         \n       balance plan or in a defined benefit plan.                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nPerformance-Based Equity Awards\n\nCatholic Advisory Services supports compensating executives at a reasonable rate and believes that executive\ncompensation should be strongly\ncorrelated to performance. Catholic Advisory Services supports equity awards that provide challenging\nperformance objectives and serve to motivate executives to superior performance and as performance-\ncontingent stock options as a significant\ncomponent of compensation.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Standard stock options and performance-accelerated awards do not meet the criteria   \n       to be considered as performance-based awards. Further, premium-priced options should have a          \n       meaningful premium to be considered performance-based                                                \n       awards.                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Second, assess the rigor of the company\u0092s performance-based equity program.

Mergers and Corporate Restructurings\n\nA merger occurs when one corporation is absorbed into another and ceases to exist. The surviving company\ngains all the rights, privileges, powers, duties, obligations\nand liabilities of the merged corporation. The shareholders of the absorbed company receive stock or\nsecurities of the surviving company or other consideration as provided by the plan of merger. Mergers,\nconsolidations, share exchanges, and sale of\nassets are friendly in nature, which is to say that both sides have agreed to the combination or acquisition\nof assets.\n\nShareholder approval for an acquiring\ncompany is generally not required under state law or stock exchange regulations unless the acquisition is in\nthe form of a stock transaction which would result in the issue of 20 percent or more of the acquirer\u0092s\noutstanding shares or voting\npower, or unless the two entities involved require that shareholders approve the deal. Under most state\nlaws, however, a target company must submit merger agreements to a shareholder vote. Shareholder approval is\nrequired in the formation of a\nconsolidated corporation.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nM&A analyses are inherently a balance of competing factors. Bright line rules are difficult if not\nimpossible to apply to a world where every deal is different.\nUltimately, the question for shareholders (both of the acquirer and the target) is the following: Is the\nvaluation fair? Shareholders of the acquirer may be concerned that the deal values the target too highly.\nShareholders of the target may be\nconcerned that the deal undervalues their interests.\n\nVote recommendation will be based on primarily an analysis of shareholder value, which itself can be\naffected by ancillary factors such as the negotiation process. The importance of other factors, including\ncorporate governance and social and environmental considerations however, should not fail to be recognized.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Votes on mergers and acquisitions are considered on a case-by-case\nbasis. A review and evaluation of the merits and drawbacks of the proposed transaction is conducted,\nbalancing various and sometimes countervailing factors including:\n                                                                                                            \n       Valuation: Is the value to be received by the target shareholders (or paid by the acquirer)          \n  \u00a7    reasonable?                                                                                          \n       While the fairness opinion may provide an initial starting point for assessing valuation             \n       reasonableness, emphasis is placed on the offer premium, market reaction and strategic rationale;    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Market reaction: How has the market responded to the proposed deal?

While the number of bankruptcies has\nrisen over the past year as evidenced by many firms, including General Motors and Lehman Brothers, the\nprevalence of these reorganizations can vary year over year due to, among other things, market conditions\nand a company\u0092s ability to sustain\nits operations. Additionally, the amount of time that lapses between a particular company\u0092s entrance into\nChapter 11 and its submission of a plan of reorganization varies significantly depending on the complexity,\ntiming, and jurisdiction of\nthe particular case. These plans are often put to a vote of shareholders (in addition to other interested\nparties), as required by the Bankruptcy Code.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on proposals to common shareholders on\nbankruptcy plans of reorganization, considering the following factors including, but not limited to:\n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Estimated value and financial prospects of the reorganized company;  \n                                                                            \n                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Percentage ownership of current shareholders in the reorganized company;  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n       Whether shareholders are adequately represented in the reorganization process (particularly through  \n  \u00a7    the existence of an                                                                                  \n       official equity committee);                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The cause(s) of the bankruptcy filing, and the extent to which the plan of reorganization addresses  \n       the cause(s);                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Existence of a superior alternative to the plan of reorganization;  \n                                                                           \n                                               \n  \u00a7    Governance of the reorganized company.  \n                                               \nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Corporations (SPACs)\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on SPAC mergers and acquisitions taking into\naccount the following:\n                                                                                                            \n       Valuation: Is the value being paid by the SPAC reasonable?

Among the reasons for this change are:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The number and variety of shareholder resolutions on social and environmental issues has increased;  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Many of the sponsors and supporters of these resolutions are large institutional shareholders with   \n  \u00a7    significant holdings,                                                                                \n       and therefore, greater direct influence on the outcomes;                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       The proposals are more sophisticated \u0096 better written, more focused, and more sensitive to the        \n  \u00a7    feasibility of                                                                                       \n       implementation;                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Investors now understand that a company\u0092s response to social and environmental issues can have        \n  \u00a7    serious economic                                                                                     \n       consequences for the company and its shareholders.                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nGlobal Approach\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for social and environmental shareholder proposals\nthat promote good corporate citizens while enhancing long-term shareholder and stakeholder value.

In order to be able to intelligently monitor their investments, shareholders often need\ninformation best provided by the company in which they have invested. Requests to report such information\nwill merit support. Requests to establish\nspecial committees of the board to address broad corporate policy and provide forums for ongoing dialogue on\nissues including, but not limited to shareholder relations, the environment, human rights, occupational\nhealth and safety, and executive\ncompensation, will generally be supported, particularly when they appear to offer a potentially effective\nmethod for enhancing shareholder value. We will closely evaluate proposals\n                                                                \n  W W W . I S S G O V E R N A N C E .

Catholic Advisory Services supports shareholder proposals that improve the company\u0092s public image,\nand reduce exposure to liabilities.\n\nDiversity and Equality\n\nSignificant progress has been made in recent years in the advancement of women and\nracial minorities in the workplace and the establishment of greater protections against discriminatory\npractices in the workplace. In the U.S, there are many civil rights laws that are enforced by the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission. The\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and nationality.\nHowever, discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, nationality, and sexual preference\ncontinues. The SEC\u0092s revised disclosure\nrules now require information on how boards factor diversity into the director nomination process, as well\nas disclosure on how the board assesses the effectiveness of its diversity policy. Shareholder proposals on\ndiversity may target a\ncompany\u0092s board nomination procedures or seek greater disclosure on a company\u0092s programs and procedures on\nincreasing the diversity of its workforce, and make reference to one or more of the following points:\n                                                                                                            \n       Violations of workplace anti-discrimination laws lead to expensive litigation and damaged corporate  \n  \u00a7    reputations that are                                                                                 \n       not in the best interests of shareholders;                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Employers already prepare employee diversity reports for the EEOC, so preparing a similar report to  \n  \u00a7    shareholders can be                                                                                  \n       done at minimal cost;                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       The presence of women, ethnic minorities and union members in workforce and customer pools gives     \n  \u00a7    companies with                                                                                       \n       diversified boards a practical advantage over their competitors as a result of their unique          \n       perspectives;                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Efforts to include women, minorities and union representatives on corporate boards can be made at    \n       reasonable costs;                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Reports can be prepared \u0093at reasonable expense\u0094 describing efforts to encourage diversified            \n  \u00a7    representation on                                                                                    \n       their boards;                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Board diversification increases the pool of the company\u0092s potential investors because more and more   \n  \u00a7    investors are                                                                                        \n       favoring companies with diverse boards;                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                           \n  \u00a7    A commitment to diversity in the workforce can lead to superior financial returns.  \n                                                                                           \nAdd Women and Minorities to the Board\n\nBoard diversification proposals ask companies to put systems in place to increase the representation of\nwomen, racial minorities, union members or other\nunderrepresented minority groups on boards of directors.

Proponents of these proposals argue that, in the future, there will be a shift toward\nbasing racial and gender discrimination suits on the distribution of corporate wealth through stock options.\nThe appearance of these proposals is\nalso in response to the nationwide wage gap and under representation of minorities and women at the highest\nlevels of compensation.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals asking companies to report on the\ndistribution of stock options by race and gender of the recipient.\n\nPrepare Report/Promote EEOC-Related Activities\n\nFilers of proposals on this issue generally ask a company to make available, at reasonable cost and omitting\nproprietary information, data the company includes in its\nannual report to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) outlining the make-up of its workforce\nby race, gender and position. Shareholders also ask companies to report on any efforts they are making to\nadvance the representation of women\nand ethnic minorities in jobs in which they have been historically underrepresented, such as sales and\nmanagement. The costs of violating federal laws that prohibit discrimination by corporations are high and\ncan affect corporate earnings. The Equal\nOpportunities Employment Commission does not release the companies\u0092 filings to the public, unless it is\ninvolved in litigation, and this information is difficult to obtain from other sources. Companies need to be\nsensitive to minority\nemployment issues as the new evolving work force becomes increasingly diverse. This information can be\nprovided with little cost to the company and does not create an unreasonable burden on management.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals that ask the company to report on its diversity and/or affirmative    \n       action programs.                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals calling for legal and regulatory compliance and public reporting      \n  \u00a7    related to                                                                                           \n       non-discrimination, affirmative action, workplace health and safety, and labor policies and          \n       practices that effect long-term corporate performance.                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals requesting nondiscrimination in salary, wages and all benefits.  \n                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals calling for action on equal employment opportunity and                \n       antidiscrimination.                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nReport on Progress Towards Glass Ceiling Commission Recommendations\n\nIn November 1995, the Glass Ceiling Commission (Commission), a bipartisan panel of leaders from business and\ngovernment, issued a report describing \u0093an unseen\nyet unbreachable barrier that keeps women and minorities from rising to the upper rungs of the corporate\nladder.\u0094 The Commission recommended that companies take practical steps to rectify this disparity, such as\nincluding diversity goals in\nbusiness plans, committing to affirmative action for qualified employees and initiating family-friendly\nlabor policies.

Although an increasing number of U.S. companies have explicitly banned discrimination on the\nbasis of sexual orientation or gender identity in their equal employment opportunity (EEO) statements, many\nstill do not. Shareholder proponents\nand other activist groups concerned with gay and lesbian rights, such as the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and\nthe Pride Foundation, have targeted U.S. companies that do not specifically restrict discrimination on the\nbasis of sexual orientation in\ntheir EEO statements. Shareholder proposals on this topic ask companies to change the language of their EEO\nstatements in order to put in place anti-discrimination protection for their gay and lesbian employees. In\naddition, proposals may seek\ndisclosure on a company\u0092s general initiatives to create a workplace free of discrimination on the basis of\nsexual orientation, including reference to such items as support of gay and lesbian employee groups,\ndiversity training that addresses\nsexual orientation, and non-medical benefits to domestic partners of gay and lesbian employees.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals to include language in EEO statements specifically barring            \n  \u00a7    discrimination on the basis of                                                                       \n       sexual orientation or gender identity.                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals seeking reports on a company\u0092s initiatives to create a workplace free  \n  \u00a7    of                                                                                                   \n       discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote against shareholder proposals that seek to eliminate protection already afforded to gay and     \n       lesbian employees.                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nReport on/Eliminate Use of Racial Stereotypes in Advertising\n\nMany companies continue to use racial stereotypes or images perceived as racially insensitive in their\nadvertising campaigns.

While primarily filed at technology firms, in\n2017, the resolutions were also filed at firms in the financial services, insurance, healthcare, and\ntelecommunication sectors. Proponents\nare expected to continue this campaign by engaging companies and filing shareholder proposals on this issue.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for requests for reports on a company\u0092s pay data by gender,\nrace, or ethnicity, or a report on a company\u0092s policies and goals to reduce any gender, race, or ethinicity\npay gap.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

In instances where companies themselves operate factories in developing countries\nfor example, these advocates have asked that the companies adopt global corporate standards that guarantee\nsustainable wages and safe\nworking conditions for their workers abroad. Companies that contract out portions of their manufacturing\noperations to foreign companies have been asked to ensure that the products they receive from those\ncontractors have not been made using forced\nlabor, child labor, or sweatshop labor. These companies are asked to adopt formal vendor standards that,\namong other things, include some sort of monitoring mechanism. Globalization, relocation of production\noverseas, and widespread use of\nsubcontractors and vendors, often make it difficult to obtain a complete picture of a company\u0092s labor\npractices in global markets. Recent deadly accidents at factories, notably in Bangladesh and in Pakistan,\nhave continued to intensify these\nconcerns. Many investors believe that companies would benefit from adopting a human rights policy based on\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization\u0092s Core Labor Standards.\nEfforts that seek greater\ndisclosure on a company\u0092s global labor practices, including its supply chain, and that seek to establish\nminimum standards for a company\u0092s operations will be supported. In addition, requests for independent\nmonitoring of overseas\noperations will be supported.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services generally supports proposals that call for the adoption and/or enforcement of\nprinciples or codes\nrelating to countries in which there are systematic violations of human rights; such as the use of slave,\nchild, or prison labor; a government that is illegitimate; or there is a call by human rights advocates,\npro-democracy organizations, or\nlegitimately-elected representatives for economic sanctions. The use of child, sweatshop, or forced labor is\nunethical and can damage corporate reputations. Poor labor practices can lead to litigation against the\ncompany, which can be costly and\ntime consuming.\n\nCodes of Conduct and Vendor Standards\n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of shareholder proposals have been submitted that pertain to the\nadoption of codes of conduct or provision, greater disclosure\non a company\u0092s international workplace standards, or that request human rights risk assessment. Companies\nhave been asked to adopt a number of different types of codes, including a workplace code of conduct,\nstandards for international business\noperations, human rights standards, International Labour Organization (ILO) standards and the SA 8000\nprinciples. The ILO is an independent agency of the United Nations which consists of 187 member nations\nrepresented by workers, employers, and\ngovernments. The ILO\u0092s general mandate is to promote a decent workplace for all individuals. The ILO sets\ninternational labor standards in the form of its conventions and then monitors compliance with the\nstandards. The seven conventions of the\nILO fall under four broad categories: Right to organize and bargain collectively, Nondiscrimination in\nemployment, Abolition of forced labor, and End of child labor. Each of the 187 member-nations of the ILO is\nbound to respect and promote these\nrights to the best of their abilities. SA 8000 is a set of labor standards, based on the principles of the\nILO conventions and other human rights conventions, and covers eight workplace conditions, including: child\nlabor, forced labor, health and\nsafety, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary\npractices, working hours and compensation. The Global Sullivan Principles are a set of guidelines that\nsupport economic, social and political justice\nby companies where they do business; to support human rights and to encourage equal opportunity at all\nlevels of employment.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to implement human rights standards and workplace codes of conduct.  \n                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals calling for the implementation and reporting on ILO codes of          \n  \u00a7    conduct, SA 8000 Standards,                                                                          \n       or the Global Sullivan Principles.                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals that call for the adoption of principles or codes of conduct          \n  \u00a7    relating to company                                                                                  \n       investments in countries with patterns of human rights abuses (e.g. Northern Ireland, Burma, former  \n       Soviet Union, and China).                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

They request companies operating abroad to\nsupport the equal employment opportunity policies that apply in facilities they operate domestically. The\nprinciples were established to address the sectarian hiring problems between Protestants and Catholics in\nNorthern Ireland. It is well\ndocumented that Northern Ireland\u0092s Catholic community faced much higher unemployment figures than the\nProtestant community. In response to this problem, the U.K. government instituted the New Fair Employment\nAct of 1989 (and subsequent\namendments) to address the sectarian hiring problems.\n\nMany companies believe that the Act adequately addresses the problems and that further action, including\nadoption of the MacBride Principles, only duplicates the efforts already underway. In evaluating a proposal\nto adopt the MacBride Principles, shareholders must decide whether the principles will cause companies to\ndivest, and therefore worsen the\nunemployment problem, or whether the principles will promote equal hiring practices. Proponents believe that\nthe Fair Employment Act does not sufficiently address the sectarian hiring problems. They argue that the\nMacBride Principles serve to\nstabilize the situation and promote further investment.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals to report on or implement the\nMacBride Principles.\n\nCommunity Impact Assessment/Indigenous Peoples\u0092 Rights\n\nIn recent years, a number of U.S. public\ncompanies have found their operations or expansion plans in conflict with local indigenous groups. In order\nto improve their standing with indigenous groups and decrease any negative publicity companies may face,\nsome concerned shareholders have\nsought reports requesting that companies review their obligations, actions and presence on these groups.\nSome have also requested these companies adopt policies based on the Draft UN Declaration on the Rights of\nIndigenous Peoples and the\nOrganization of American States\u0092 (OAS) American Declaration on rights of Indigenous Peoples. Some companies,\nsuch as Starbucks, have reached agreements with local governments to ensure better business practices for\nproducts produced by\nindigenous groups. Shareholders, concerned with the negative impact that the company\u0092s operations may have\non the indigenous people\u0092s land and community, have sought reports detailing the impact of the company\u0092s\nactions and presence\non these groups.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals asking to prepare reports on a\ncompany\u0092s environmental and health impact on communities.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Through a\npractice known as off-shoring, the outsourcing or moving of manufacturing and service operations to foreign\nmarkets with lower labor costs,\ncompanies have found one method where the perceived savings potential is quite substantial. Shareholder\nopponents of outsourcing argue that there may be long-term consequences to offshore outsourcing that\noutweigh short-term benefits such as\nbacklash from a public already sensitive to off-shoring, security risks from information technology\ndevelopment overseas, and diminished employee morale. Shareholder proposals addressing outsourcing ask that\ncompanies prepare a report to\nshareholders evaluating the risk to the company\u0092s brand name and reputation in the U.S. from outsourcing and\noff-shoring of manufacturing and service work to other countries.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholders proposals asking companies to report on the\nrisks associated with outsourcing or off-shoring.\n\nReport on the Impact of Health Pandemics on Company Operations\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is the most affected region in the world with regard to the HIV/AIDS\npandemic. With limited access to antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS, the increasing death toll is\nexpected to have profound social, political and economic impact on that region and the companies or\nindustries with operations in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica. In the past, shareholder proposals asked companies to develop policies to provide affordable\nHIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis drugs in third-world countries. However, in recent years, shareholders\nhave changed their tactic, asking instead\nfor reports on the impact of these pandemics on company operations, including both pharmaceutical and non-\npharmaceutical companies operating in high-risk areas. This change is consistent with the general shift in\nshareholder proposals towards risk\nassessment and mitigation.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals asking for companies to report on\nthe impact of pandemics, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, on their business strategies.\n\nMandatory Arbitration\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for requests for a report on a company\u0092s use of\nmandatory arbitration on employment-related claims.\n\nSexual Harassment\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for requests for a report on company actions taken\nto strengthen policies and oversight to prevent workplace sexual harassment, or a report on risks posed by a\ncompany\u0092s failure to prevent workplace sexual harassment.\n                                                                                                            \n   Operations in High Risk Markets                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nIn recent years, shareholder advocates and human rights organizations have highlighted concerns associated\nwith companies operating in regions that are politically\nunstable, including state sponsors of terror. The U.S. government has active trade sanction regimes in place\nagainst a number of countries, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria, among others. These\nsanctions are enforced by the Office\nof Foreign Assets Control, which is part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

Concerned shareholders have\nrequested investment withdrawals or cessation of operations in high-risk markets as well as reports on\noperations in high-risk markets. Such\nreports may seek additional disclosure from companies on criteria employed for investing in, continuing to\noperate in, and withdrawing from specific countries.\n\nDepending on the country\u0092s human rights record, investors have also asked companies to refrain from\ncommencing new projects in the country of concern until\nimprovements are made.

The U.S.\nBusiness Principles for Human\nRights of Workers in China may help a company with operations in China avoid being blacklisted by U.S.\nstates and municipalities, many of whom have limited their contracts with companies that fail to adopt\nsimilar principles in other countries\nrecognized for committing gross human rights violations.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals requesting more disclosure on a company\u0092s involvement in China  \n                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote case-by-case on shareholder proposals that ask a company to terminate a project or investment   \n       in China.                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Resolution sponsors generally argue that the Chinese government is using IT company\ntechnologies to track, monitor, identify,\nand, ultimately, suppress political dissent. In the view of proponents, this process of surveillance and\nassociated suppression violates internationally accepted norms outlined in the U.N. Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights.\n\nWhile early shareholder resolutions on Internet issues focused on censorship by repressive regimes and net\nneutrality, proponents have recently raised concerns\nregarding privacy and data security in the wake of increased breaches that result in the misuse of personal\ninformation. On Oct. 13, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a guidance document about\nthe disclosure obligations\nrelating to cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents. In the document, the SEC references the negative\nconsequences that are associated with cyber-attacks, such as: remediation costs, including those required to\nrepair relationships with customers\nand clients; increased cyber-security protection costs; lost revenues from unauthorized use of the\ninformation or missed opportunities to attract clients; litigation; and reputational damage. The document\nsays that while the federal securities laws\ndo not explicitly require disclosure of cybersecurity risks and incidents, some disclosure requirements may\nimpose an obligation on the company to disclose such information and provides scenarios where disclosure may\nbe required. A 2013 study by the\nPonemon Institute found that the median annualized cost of cyber-attacks for the 60 organizations studied\nwas $11.6 million. The study also found that the number of successful cyber-attacks among the 60 companies\nincreased by 18 percent between 2012\nand 2013, from 102 successful attacks on average per week to 122.\n\nMore recently, data security has been the focus of media outlets and a public concern. During\nthe 2013 holiday shopping season, Target, Neiman Marcus, and other retailers were the targets of hackers\nlooking to steal credit card numbers. It is estimated that as many as 40 million customer credit and debit\ncard accounts were stolen at\nTarget alone. These incidents preceded what many people consider the largest data security breach in the\nUnited States. In June 2013, major media outlets began releasing information about leaked classified\ndocuments disclosed by Edward Snowden, an\nNSA contractor. The documents revealed a government-run Internet and telephone surveillance program aimed at\ncollecting metadata. As part of this operation, the government is said to have obtained from major U.S.\ntelecommunications companies the\ncall records of their customers.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Scientists\ngenerally agree that gases released by chemical reactions\nincluding the burning of fossil fuels contribute to a \u0093greenhouse effect\u0094 that traps the planet\u0092s heat.\nEnvironmentalists claim that the Greenhouse Gases(GHG) produced by the industrial age have caused recent\nweather crises such as\nheat waves, rainstorms, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and receding coastlines. Climate change skeptics\nhave described the rise and fall of global temperatures as naturally occurring phenomena and depicted human\nimpact on climate change as\nminimal. Shareholder proposals requesting companies to issue a report to shareholders, \u0093at reasonable cost\nand omitting proprietary information,\u0094 on greenhouse gas emissions ask that the report include descriptions\nof corporate efforts to\nreduce emissions, companies\u0092 financial exposure and potential liability from operations that contribute to\nglobal warming, their direct or indirect efforts to promote the view that global warming is not a threat,\nand their goals in reducing\nthese emissions from their operations. Shareholder proponents argue that there is scientific proof that the\nburning of fossil fuels causes global warming, that future legislation may make companies financially liable\nfor their contributions to\nglobal warming, and that a report on the company\u0092s role in global warming can be assembled at reasonable\ncost.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals seeking information on the financial, physical, or regulatory risks   \n  \u00a7    it faces related to                                                                                  \n       climate change- on its operations and investments, or on how the company identifies, measures, and   \n       manage such risks.                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals calling for the reduction of GHG or adoption of GHG goals in          \n       products and operations.                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals seeking reports on responses to regulatory and public pressures       \n  \u00a7    surrounding climate                                                                                  \n       change, and for disclosure of research that aided in setting company policies around climate         \n       change.                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals requesting reports on greenhouse gas emissions from companies\u0092         \n  \u00a7    operations and/or                                                                                    \n       products.                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nInvest in Clean/Renewable Energy\n\nFilers of proposals on renewable energy ask companies to increase their investment in renewable energy\nsources and to work to develop products that rely more on\nrenewable energy sources. Increased use of renewable energy will reduce the negative environmental impact of\nenergy companies. In addition, as supplies of oil and coal exist in the earth in limited quantities,\nrenewable energy sources represent a\ncompetitive, and some would argue essential, long-term business strategy.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Shareholders propose that corporations\nshould have energy efficient manufacturing processes and should market more energy efficient products. This\ncan be done by utilizing renewable energy sources that are cost-competitive and by implementing energy\nefficient operations.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals requesting a report on company\nenergy efficiency policies and/or goals.\n\nEnvironment\n\nProposals addressing environmental and energy concerns are plentiful, and generally seek greater disclosure\non a particular issue or seek to improve a\ncompany\u0092s environmental practices in order to protect the world\u0092s natural resources. In addition, some\nproponents cite the negative financial implications for companies with poor environmental practices,\nincluding liabilities associated\nwith site clean-ups and lawsuits, as well as arguments that energy efficient products and clean\nenvironmental practices are sustainable business practices that will contribute to long-term shareholder\nvalue. Shareholders proponents point out that\nthe majority of independent atmospheric scientists agree that global warming poses a serious problem to the\nhealth and welfare of our planet, citing the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nShareholder activists argue that\ncompanies can report on their greenhouse gas emissions within a few months at reasonable cost. The general\ntrend indicates a movement towards encouraging companies to have proactive environmental policies, focusing\non maximizing the efficient use of\nnon-renewable resources and minimizing threats of harm to human health or the environment.\n\nEnvironmental/Sustainability Reports\n\nShareholders may request general environmental disclosures or reports on a specific location/operation,\noften requesting that the company detail the environmental\nrisks and potential liabilities of a specific project. Increasingly, companies have begun reporting on\nenvironmental and sustainability issues using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. The GRI was\nestablished in 1997 with the mission of\ndeveloping globally applicable guidelines for reporting on economic, environmental, and social performance.\nThe GRI was developed by Ceres (formerly known as the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies)\nin partnership with the United\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP).\n\nCeres was formed in the wake of the March 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, when a consortium of investors,\nenvironmental\ngroups, and religious organizations drafted what were originally named the Valdez Principles. Later named\nthe Ceres Principles, and now branded the Ceres Roadmap 2030, corporate signatories of the Ceres Roadmap\n2030 pledge to institute\naccountability mechanisms that integrate sustainability considerations into core business systems and\ndecision-making on topics such as governance, stakeholder engagement and disclosure. Signatories also pledge\nto build systems across a\ncorporation\u0092s value chain to enable ongoing improvements in three priority environmental and social impact\nareas (Climate Change, Natural Resources, and Human Rights).\n\nThe Equator Principles are the financial industry\u0092s benchmark for determining, assessing and managing social\nand environmental risk in project financing. First\nlaunched in June 2003, the Principles were ultimately adopted by over\n                                                                \n  W W W . I S S G O V E R N A N C E .

Since its adoption, the Principles have undergone a number of revisions, expanding the use of\nperformance standards and signatory banks\u0092 banks\u0092 commitments to social responsibility, including human\nrights, climate change, and\ntransparency. The fourth iteration of the Principles was launched in November 2019, incorporating amendments\nand new commitment to human rights, climate change, Indigenous Peoples and biodiversity related topics.\nFinancial institutions adopt these\nprinciples to ensure that the projects they finance are developed in a socially responsible manner and\nreflect sound environmental management practices. As of 2019, 101 financial institutions have officially\nadopted the Equator Principles.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals seeking greater disclosure on the company\u0092s environmental and social   \n  \u00a7    practices,                                                                                           \n       and/or associated risks and liabilities.                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals asking companies to report in accordance with the Global Reporting    \n       Initiative (GRI).                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals seeking the preparation of sustainability reports.  \n                                                                                          \n                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to study or implement the Ceres Roadmap 2030.  \n                                                                                     \n                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to study or implement the Equator Principles.  \n                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n   Operations in Environmentally Sensitive Areas                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nCanadian Oil Sands\n\nProposals asking for a report on oil sands operations in the Athabasca region of Alberta, Canada have\nappeared at a number of oil and gas companies. Alberta\u0092s\noil sands contain a reserve largely thought to be one of the world\u0092s largest potential energy sources.\nRising oil sands production in Alberta has been paralleled with concerns from a variety of\nstakeholders\u0097including environmental groups,\nlocal residents, and shareholders\u0097regarding the environmental impacts of the complicated extraction and\nupgrading processes required to convert oil sands into a synthetic crude oil. The high viscosity of bitumen\nmakes its extraction a\nchallenging and resource-intensive process; the most common extraction technique involves pumping steam into\nthe oil sands to lower the viscosity of bitumen in order to pump it to the surface.\n\nOne of the most prominent issues concerning oil sands is the large volume of greenhouse gases (GHG)\nassociated with production. Oil sands are by far one of the most\nenergy-intensive forms of oil production, releasing three times more GHG emissions from production than\nconventional oil.\n\nShareholders have kept up pressure on\nthe issue of potential long-term risks to companies posed by the environmental, social, and economic\nchallenges associated with Canadian oil sands operations. Resolutions on the topic have focused on\nrequesting greater transparency on the\nramifications of oil sands development projects.\n\nArctic National Wildlife Refuge\n\nThe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is a federally protected wilderness along Alaska\u0092s North Slope.\nIn the past, legislation proposed in both the House\nand Senate that, if passed, would allow a portion of this area to be leased to private companies for\ndevelopment and production of oil, has been witnessed. Oil companies have expressed an interest in bidding\nfor these leases given the opportunity.\nIn response, shareholder activists have filed resolutions asking these companies to cancel any plans to\ndrill in the ANWR and cease their lobbying efforts to open the area for drilling. Proponents of shareholder\nproposals on this issue argue that\nthe Coastal Plain section of the ANWR is the most environmentally sensitive area of the refuge, that the\nmajority of Alaska\u0092s North Slope that is not federally designated wilderness already provides the oil\nindustry with sufficient resources\nfor oil production, and that advocates of drilling in ANWR overstate the benefit to be derived from opening\nthe wilderness to oil production. Those in favor of opening the area up to drilling note that only a small\nportion of ANWR would be\nconsidered for exploration, and if drilling were to take place, it would be on less than one percent of the\nentire area, that modern technology reduces the environmental impact of oil drilling on both the land and\nsurrounding wildlife, and that oil\nproduction in ANWR would have considerable benefit to company shareholders, Alaskans, and the United States\nas a whole.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

As this\npractice has gained more widespread use, environmentalists have raised concerns that the chemicals mixed\nwith sand and water to aid the\nfracturing process can contaminate ground water supplies. Proponents of resolutions at companies that employ\nhydraulic fracturing are also concerned that wastewater produced by the process could overload the waste\ntreatment plants to which it is\nshipped.

This legislation empowers the imposition of a ban on tobacco\nadvertising within 1,000 feet of\nschools and playgrounds, require FDA-approved graphic warning labels that occupy 50 percent of the space on\neach package of cigarettes.\n\nIn September 2009, the\nFDA issued a ban on the sale of flavored cigarettes, exercising its regulatory power in a major way over\ntobacco for the first time under the new law.

Shareholder proponents, activists and even some\nlegislators have called upon drug companies to restrain pricing of prescription drugs.\n\nThe high cost of prescription drugs is a vital issue for senior citizens across the country. Seniors have\nthe greatest need for prescription drugs, accounting for a\nsignificant portion of all prescription drug sales, but they often live on fixed incomes and are\nunderinsured.\n\nProponents note that efforts to reign-in\npharmaceutical costs will not negatively impact research and development (R&D) costs and that retail drug\nprices are consistently higher in the U.S. than in other industrialized nations. Pharmaceutical companies\noften respond that adopting a\nformal drug pricing policy could put the company at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the AIDS crisis in Africa, many shareholders have called\non companies to address the issue of affordable drugs for the treatment of AIDS, as well as tuberculosis and\nmalaria throughout the developing world. When analyzing such resolutions, consideration should be made of\nthe strategic implications of\npricing policies in the market.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to prepare a report on drug pricing.  \n                                                                            \n                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to adopt a formal policy on drug pricing.  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals that call on companies to develop a policy to provide affordable      \n  \u00a7    HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis,                                                                             \n       and malaria drugs in third-world nations.                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for proposals asking for reports on the economic effects and legal risks of limiting            \n  \u00a7    pharmaceutical products to                                                                           \n       Canada or certain wholesalers.                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote case-by-case proposals requesting that companies adopt policies not to constrain prescription   \n  \u00a7    drug re-importation by                                                                               \n       limiting supplies to foreign markets.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nGovernment and Military\n\nWeapons-related proposals may target handguns, landmines, defense contracting, or sale of weapons to foreign\ngovernments.\n\nPrepare Report to Renounce Future Landmine Production\n\nAlthough very few companies currently produce landmines, some companies continue to have links to landmine\nproduction or produce components that are used to make\nlandmines. Shareholders have asked companies to renounce the future development of landmines or their\ncomponents, or to prepare a report on the feasibility of such a renouncement.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The\nproposals can take various forms. One resolution simply calls on companies to report on their foreign\nmilitary sales, provide information on\nmilitary product exports, disclose the company\u0092s basis for determining whether those sales should be made,\nand any procedures used to market or negotiate those sales. Another resolution calls for companies to report\non \u0093offsets\u0094 e.g.\nguarantee of new jobs in the purchasing country and technology transfers. Offsets involve a commitment by\nmilitary contractors and the U.S. government to direct benefits back to a foreign government as a condition\nof a military sale.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to report on foreign military sales or offset agreements.  \n                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                      \n  \u00a7    Vote case-by-case on proposals that call for outright restrictions on foreign military sales.  \n                                                                                                      \nDepleted Uranium/Nuclear Weapons\n\nDepleted uranium is the less radioactive uranium that is left behind after enriched uranium is produced for\nnuclear reactor fuel and fissile material for nuclear\nweapons. The main difference is that depleted uranium contains at least three times less U-235 than natural\nuranium. However, it is still weakly radioactive. Shareholders want reports on companies\u0092 policies,\nprocedures and involvement in the\nsaid substance and nuclear weapons.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for\nshareholder proposals requesting a report on involvement, policies, and procedures related to depleted\nuranium and nuclear weapons.\n\nAdopt Ethical Criteria for Weapons Contracts\n\nShareholders have requested that companies review their code of conduct and statements of ethical\ncriteria for military production-related contract bids, awards, and execution to incorporate environmental\nfactors and sustainability issues related to the contract bidding process. Sustainability is a business\nmodel that requires companies to\nbalance the needs and interests of various stakeholders while concurrently sustaining their businesses,\ncommunities, and the environment for future generations.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for shareholder proposals asking companies to review\nand amend, if necessary, the company\u0092s code of conduct and statements of ethical criteria for military\nproduction-related contract bids, awards and execution.\n\nAnimal Welfare\n\nAnimal Rights/Testing\n\nShareholders and animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical\nTreatment of Animals (PETA), may file resolutions calling for the end to painful and unnecessary animal\ntesting on laboratory animals by companies developing products for the cosmetics and medical supply\nindustry. Since advanced testing methods now\nproduce many reliable results without the use of live animals, Catholic Advisory Services generally supports\nproposals on this issue. In cases where it can be determined that alternative testing methods are unreliable\nor are required by law,\nCatholic Advisory Services recommends voting against such proposals.

Catholic Advisory Services is generally supportive of\nincreased transparency around corporate charitable giving. However, some resolutions extend beyond mere\ndisclosure requests and attempt to\ninfluence or restrict companies\u0092 contributions to specific types of beneficiaries in a manner that furthers\nparticular objectives supported by the proposal sponsors. Catholic Advisory Services believes that\nmanagement is better positioned to\ndecide what criteria are appropriate for making corporate charitable contributions.

More\nspecifically, predatory lending includes misleading\nsubprime borrowers about the terms of a loan, charging excessive fees that are folded into the body of a\nrefinancing loan, including life insurance policies or other unnecessary additions to a mortgage, or lending\nto homeowners with insufficient\nincome to cover loan payments.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for shareholder\nproposals seeking the development of a policy or preparation of a report to guard against predatory lending\npractices.\n\nDisclosure on Credit in Developing Countries (LDCs) or Forgive LDC Debt\n\nShareholders have asked banks and other financial services firms to\ndevelop and disclose lending policies for less developed countries. Proponents are concerned that, without\nsuch policies, lending to developing countries may contribute to the outflow of capital, the inefficient use\nof capital, and corruption, all\nof which increase the risk of loan loss. In the interest of promoting improved LDC lending practices and\nresponsible loan disclosure, Catholic Advisory Services generally supports voting for such proposals. In\ncases where it can be determined that\ncompanies have been proactive and responsible in developing policies, Catholic Advisory Services may\nrecommend a vote against the proposal\u0092s adoption. Catholic Advisory Services usually opposes proposals that\ncall for outright loan forgiveness;\nsuch action represents an unacceptable loss to lending institutions and their shareholders.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services may support such proposals at banks that\nhave failed to make reasonable provisions for non-performing loans as a means to encourage a change in\npolicy.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking for disclosure on lending practices in developing countries,   \n  \u00a7    unless the company has                                                                               \n       demonstrated a clear proactive record on the issue.                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                   \n  \u00a7    Vote against shareholder proposals asking banks to forgive loans outright.  \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote case-by-case on shareholder proposals asking for loan forgiveness at banks that have failed to  \n  \u00a7    make reasonable                                                                                      \n       provisions for non-performing loans.                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                        \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals to restructure and extend the terms of non-performing loans.  \n                                                                                        \nCommunity Investing\n\nShareholders may ask for a company to prepare a report addressing the company\u0092s community investing efforts.\n\nSuch proposals also ask companies to review their policies regarding their investments in different\ncommunities.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for proposals that seek a policy review or report\naddressing the company\u0092s community investing efforts.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

However, with the consolidation of the communications industry, a number of large companies\nhave ended up with ownership of cable companies. These cable companies may offer their customers access to\npay-per-view programming or\nchannels intended for adult audiences. Proponents of shareholder proposals on this issue ask cable companies\nand companies with interests in cable companies to assess the costs and benefits of continuing to distribute\nsexually-explicit content,\nincluding the potential negative impact on the company\u0092s image.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for shareholder proposals that seek a review of the\ncompany\u0092s involvement with pornography.\n\nAbortion/Right to Life Issues\n\nShareholder proposals pertaining to abortion and right to life issues are rare. However, in the past\nshareholders\nhave asked companies to stop manufacturing abortifacient drugs; to separate abortifacient drug operations\nfrom other operations; or to discontinue acute-care or physician management practices that involve support\nfor abortion services.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote on shareholder proposals that address right to life\nissues in a manner consistent with the teachings of the Catholic Church on abortion and right to life\nissues.\n\nAnti-Social Proposals\n\nA number of \u0091anti-social\u0092 shareholder proposals have been filed at companies requesting increased\ndisclosure. While these proposals\u0092 requests are very\nsimilar to those submitted by shareholder advocates within traditional socially responsible investor\ncircles, the underlying motives for filing the proposals appear to be very different. In addition to\ncharitable contribution proposals, anti-social\nproposals addressing climate change, sustainability, and conflicts of interest may be seen at shareholder\nmeetings. Despite implicitly different motivations in some of these proposals, the underlying requests for\nincreased disclosure, in some cases,\nmay be worth shareholder support.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote against shareholder proposals that do not seek to ultimately advance the goals of the social    \n       investment community.                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote case-by-case on anti-social shareholder proposals seeking a review or report on the company\u0092s    \n  \u00a7    charitable                                                                                           \n       contributions.                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nViolence and Adult Themes in Video Games\n\nPerceptions of increased sex and violence in video games have led certain shareholders to question the\navailability of adult-themed content to children and teens. The\nEntertainment Software Ratings Board, which provides ratings for video games, has classified approximately\n34 percent of the total games it reviews as either Teen, Mature, or Adults Only.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for shareholder proposals asking for reports on\ncompany policies related to the sale of mature-rated video games to children and teens.\n                                                                \n  W W W . I S S G O V E R N A N C E .

The shareholder sponsors of the resolutions look to\ncompanies to review current compensation practices and to include social or environmental performance\ncriteria such as accounting for \u0093poor\ncorporate citizenship\u0094 and meeting environmental or workplace safety objectives and metrics when evaluating\nexecutive compensation. Some of the non-financial criteria that proponents of these resolutions seek to be\nincorporated in compensation\nprogram design include workplace safety, environmental stewardship, or diversity and customer/employee\nsatisfaction \u0096 as part of a written policy used to align compensation with performance on non-financial\nfactors alongside financial criteria.\n\nProponents believe that factors such as poor environmental performance, workplace lawsuits, etc. could have\na significant adverse impact on a company\u0092s\nfinancial performance if not proactively and adequately addressed, and that these factors should be\nconsidered along with traditional financial considerations when determining executive pay. The significant\nstock price declines and massive\nlosses in shareholder value stemming from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster and the tragic explosion\nat Massey Energy\u0092s Upper Big Branch mine that killed 29 employees is a sobering reminder of the need to have\nthe right management\nincentives in place to ensure that social and environmental risks are actively managed and mitigated\nagainst. Given the proliferation of derivative lawsuits targeted at firms such as Halliburton, Transocean\nand Cameron International that were\nsuppliers to or partners with BP in a capacity that ignored safety considerations or that contributed to the\neconomic and ecological disaster, investors are increasingly mindful of the far-reaching implications that\nexposure to social or\nenvironmental risks could have on shareholder value at portfolio companies.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals calling for linkage of executive pay to non-financial factors         \n  \u00a7    including performance                                                                                \n       against social and environmental goals, customer/employee satisfaction, corporate downsizing,        \n       community involvement, human rights, or predatory lending.                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals seeking reports on linking executive pay to non-financial factors.  \n                                                                                                          \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Socially responsible investors\ninvest for economic gain, as do all investors, but they also require that the companies in which they invest\nconduct their business in a socially and environmentally responsible manner.\n\nThese dual objectives carry through to socially responsible investors\u0092 proxy voting activity once the\nsecurity selection process is completed. In voting their\nshares, socially responsible institutional shareholders are concerned not only with sustainable economic\nreturns to shareholders and good corporate governance but also with the ethical behavior of corporations and\nthe social and environmental impact\nof their actions.\n\nSocial Advisory Services has, therefore, developed proxy voting guidelines that are consistent with the dual\nobjectives of socially responsible\nshareholders. On matters of social and environmental import, the guidelines seek to reflect a broad\nconsensus of the socially responsible investing community. Generally, we take as our frame of reference\npolicies that have been developed by groups\nsuch as the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, the General Board of Pension and Health Benefits\nof the United Methodist Church, Domini Social Investments, and other leading church shareholders and\nsocially responsible mutual fund\ncompanies. Additionally, we incorporate the active ownership and investment philosophies of leading globally\nrecognized initiatives such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the\nUnited Nations Principles for\nResponsible Investment (UNPRI), the United Nations Global Compact, and environmental and social European\nUnion Directives.\n\nOn matters of corporate governance,\nexecutive compensation, and corporate structure, Social Advisory Services guidelines are based on a\ncommitment to create and preserve economic value and to advance principles of good corporate governance\nconsistent with responsibilities to society\nas a whole.\n\nThe guidelines provide an overview of how Social Advisory Services recommends that its clients vote. We note\nthat there may be cases in which the\nfinal vote recommendation on a particular company varies from the vote guideline due to the fact that we\nclosely examine the merits of each proposal and consider relevant information and company-specific\ncircumstances in arriving at our decisions.\nWhere Social Advisory Services acts as voting agent for its clients, it follows each client\u0092s voting policy,\nwhich may differ in some cases from the policies outlined in this document. Social Advisory Services updates\nits guidelines on an\nannual basis to take into account emerging issues and trends on environmental, social, and corporate\ngovernance topics, in addition to evolving market standards, regulatory changes, and client feedback.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Board of Directors\n\nA corporation\u0092s board of directors sits at the apogee of the corporate governance system. Though they\nnormally delegate responsibility for the management of the\nbusiness to the senior executives they select and oversee, directors bear ultimate responsibility for the\nconduct of the corporation\u0092s business. The role of directors in publicly held corporations has undergone\nconsiderable change in recent\nyears. Once derided as rubber stamps for management, directors of public corporations today are expected to\nserve as effective guardians of shareholders\u0092 interests.\n\nVoting on directors and board-related issues is the most important use of the shareholder franchise, not\nsimply a routine proxy item. Although uncontested director\nelections do not present alternative nominees from whom to choose, a high percentage of opposition votes is\nan expression of shareholder dissatisfaction and should be sufficient to elicit a meaningful response from\nmanagement.\n\nThe role and responsibilities of directors has increasingly been the subject of much discussion and debate,\ngiven the current economic climate and the difficulties\nmany companies now face in their respective markets. Influential organizations, including the American Law\nInstitute, the American Bar Association, the National Association of Corporate Directors, and the Business\nRoundtable have issued reports and\nrecommendations regarding the duties and accountability of corporate boards. Both mainstream and alternative\nmedia outlets have highlighted the numerous gaps within risk oversight of company boards and individual\ndirectors, and many institutional\ninvestors, in response, have capitalized on their rights as stakeholders to prompt changes. Corporations\nhave taken notice, implementing many of the reforms championed by their shareholders.\n\nAlthough differences of opinion remain, a fairly strong consensus has emerged on a number of key issues. It\nis widely agreed that the board\u0092s most important\nresponsibility is to ensure that the corporation is managed in the shareholders\u0092 best long-term economic\ninterest. This will often require boards to consider the impact of their actions on other constituencies,\nincluding employees, customers,\nlocal communities, and the environment.\n                                                                                      \n  \u00a7    The board\u0092s principal functions are widely agreed to consist of the following:  \n                                                                                      \n                                                                                                          \n  \u00a7    To select, evaluate, and if necessary, replace management, including the chief executive officer;  \n                                                                                                          \n                                                                         \n  \u00a7    To review and approve major strategies and financial objectives;  \n                                                                         \n                                                    \n  \u00a7    To advise management on significant issues;  \n                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    To assure that effective controls are in place to safeguard corporate assets, manage risk, and       \n       comply with the law; and                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                         \n  \u00a7    To nominate directors and otherwise ensure that the board functions effectively.  \n                                                                                         \nBoards are expected to have a majority of directors independent of management. The independent directors are\nexpected to organize much of the board\u0092s work, even\nif the chief executive officer also serves as Chairman of the board. Key committees of the board are\nexpected to be entirely independent of management. It is expected that boards will engage in critical self-\nevaluation of themselves and of\nindividual members. Individual directors, in turn, are expected to devote significant amounts of time to\ntheir duties, to limit the number of directorships they accept, and to own a meaningful amount of stock in\ncompanies on whose boards they serve.\nDirectors are ultimately responsible to the corporation\u0092s shareholders. The most direct expression of this\nresponsibility is the requirement that directors be elected to their positions by the shareholders.\nShareholders are also asked to vote\non a number of other matters regarding the role, structure, and composition of the board. Social Advisory\nServices classifies directors as either executive, non-independent non-executive, or independent directors.\n\nUncontested Election of Directors\n\nFour broad principles apply when determining votes on director nominees:\n                                                                                                            \n      Board Accountability: Accountability refers to the promotion of transparency into a company\u0092s          \n  1.  governance practices and annual board elections and the provision to shareholders the ability to      \n      remove problematic directors and to vote                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

These practices help reduce the  \n  opportunity for management entrenchment.     \n                                               \n                                                                                                            \n      Board Responsiveness: Directors should be responsive to shareholders, particularly in regard to       \n      shareholder proposals that receive a majority vote or management proposals that receive significant   \n  2.  opposition and to tender offers where a majority of shares are tendered. Furthermore, shareholders    \n      should expect directors to devote sufficient time                                                     \n      and resources to oversight of the company.                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  3.  Director Independence: Without independence from management, the board may be unwilling or unable to  \n      effectively set company strategy and scrutinize performance or executive compensation.                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n      Director Diversity/Competence: Companies should seek a diverse board of directors who can add value   \n      to                                                                                                    \n      the board through their specific skills or expertise and who can devote sufficient time and           \n  4.  commitment to serve effectively. Boards should be of a size appropriate to accommodate diversity,     \n      expertise, and independence, while ensuring active and                                                \n      collaborative participation by all members. Boards should be sufficiently diverse to ensure           \n      consideration of a wide range of perspectives.                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for director nominees, except under the following\ncircumstances (with new nominees1considered on a case-by-casebasis):\n\nBoard Accountability\n\nVote against or withhold from the entire board of directors (except new nominees, who should be considered\ncase-by-case) for the following:\n\nProblematic Takeover Defenses, Capital Structure, and Governance Structures\n\nClassified Board Structure:The board is classified, and a continuing director responsible for a problematic\ngovernance issue at the board/committee level that would warrant an against/withhold recommendation is not\nup for election.

Current interim officers are included in this category. For private companies, the equivalent\npositions are applicable. A non-employeedirector serving as an officer due to statutory requirements (e.g.\ncorporate secretary) will generally be classified as a Non-Independent Non-ExecutiveDirector under \u0093Any\nmaterial relationship with the company.\u0094 However, if the company provides explicit disclosure that the\ndirector is not receiving additional compensation exceeding $10,000 per year for serving in that capacity,\nthen the director will be classified as an Independent Director. ii \u0093Affiliate\u0094 includes a subsidiary,\nsibling company, or parent company. Social Advisory Services uses 50 percent control ownership by the parent\ncompany as the standard for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor of an externally managed\nissuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate. iiiIncludes any former CEO of the company prior to the company\u0092s\ninitial public offering (IPO). ivWhen there is a former CEO of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC)\nserving on the board of an acquired company, Social Advisory Services will generally classify such directors\nas independent unless determined otherwise taking into account the following factors: the applicable listing\nstandards determination of such director\u0092s independence; any operating ties to the firm; and the existence\nof any other conflicting relationships or related party transactions. vSocial Advisory Services will look at\nthe terms of the interim officer\u0092s employment contract to determine if it contains severance pay, long-term\nhealth and pension benefits, or other such standard provisions typically contained in contracts of\npermanent, non-temporaryCEOs. Social Advisory Services will also consider if a formal search process was\nunder way for a full-time officer at the time. vi\u0093Immediate family member\u0094 follows the SEC\u0092s definition of\nsuch and covers spouses, parents, children, step-parents, step-children, siblings, in-laws,and any person\n(other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of any director, nominee for director, executive\nofficer, or significant shareholder of the company. viiProfessional services can be characterized as\nadvisory in nature, generally involve access to sensitive company information or to strategic decision-\nmaking, and typically have a commission- or fee-basedpayment structure. Professional services generally\ninclude, but are not limited to the following: investment banking/financial advisory services; commercial\nbanking (beyond deposit services); investment services; insurance services; accounting/audit services;\nconsulting services; marketing services; legal services; property management services; realtor services;\nlobbying services; executive search services; and IT consulting services. The following would generally be\nconsidered transactional relationships and not professional services: deposit services; IT tech support\nservices; educational services; and construction services. The case of participation in a banking syndicate\nby a non-leadbank should be considered a transactional (and hence subject to the associated materiality\ntest) rather than a professional relationship. \u0093Of Counsel\u0094 relationships are only considered immaterial if\nthe individual does not receive any form of compensation (in excess of $10,000 per year) from, or is a\nretired partner of, the firm providing the professional service. The case of a company providing a\nprofessional service to one of its directors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated,\nwill be considered a transactional rather than a professional relationship. Insurance services and marketing\nservices are assumed to be professional services unless the company explains why such services are not\nadvisory. viiiA material transactional relationship, including grants to non-profitorganizations, exists if\nthe company makes annual payments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity exceeding the greater\nof $200,000 or 5 percent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues, in the case of a company which follows NASDAQ\nlisting standards; or the greater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues, in the case\nof a company which follows NYSE listing standards. In the case of a company which follows neither of the\npreceding standards, Social Advisory Services will apply the NASDAQ-based materiality test. (The recipient\nis the party receiving the financial proceeds from the transaction). ixDissident directors who are parties\nto a voting agreement pursuant to a settlement or similar arrangement may be classified as independent\ndirectors if an analysis of the following factors indicates that the voting agreement does not compromise\ntheir alignment with all shareholders\u0092 interests: the terms of the agreement; the duration of the standstill\nprovision in the agreement; the limitations and requirements of actions that are agreed upon; if the\ndissident director nominee(s) is subject to the standstill; and if there any conflicting relationships or\nrelated party transactions.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Although staggered boards can provide continuity for companies at the board level, there are also a\nnumber of downsides to the structure. First, a classified board can also be used to entrench management and\neffectively preclude most takeover\nbids or proxy contests. Board classification forces dissidents and would-be acquirers to negotiate with the\nincumbent board, which has the authority to decide on offers without a shareholder vote. In addition,\nwhen a board is classified, it is difficult to remove individual members for either poor attendance or poor\nperformance; shareholders would only have the chance to vote on a given director every third year when he or\nshe comes up for election. The\nclassified board structure can also limit shareholders\u0092 ability to withhold votes from inside directors that\nsit on key board committee, or to withhold votes from an entire board slate to protest the lack of board\ndiversity. According to\nISS\u0092 2012 Board Practices study, the number of S&P 500 companies with classified boards has continued to\nfall. In 2015, only 17 percent of S&P 500 companies maintained staggered boards, compared to 25 percent in\n2014,\n30 percent in 2013, and 39 percent in 2010. While we recognize that there are some advantages to classified\nboards, based on the latest studies on classified boards, the fact that classified boards can make it more\ndifficult for\nshareholders to remove individual directors, and the fact that classified boards can be used as an\nantitakeover device, Social Advisory Services recommends against the adoption of classified boards.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                        \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals to repeal classified boards and to elect all  \n       directors annually.                                              \n                                                                        \n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals to classify (stagger) the board of directors.  \n                                                                             \nMajority Vote Threshold for Director Elections\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally vote for management proposals to adopt a majority\nof votes cast standard for directors in uncontested elections.\n\nVote against if no carve-out for plurality in contested\nelections is included.\n\nCumulative Voting\n\nMost corporations provide that shareholders are entitled to cast one vote for each share owned. Under a\ncumulative voting scheme the shareholder is permitted to have\none vote per share for each director to be elected. Shareholders are permitted to apportion those votes in\nany manner they wish among the director candidates. Shareholders have the opportunity to elect a minority\nrepresentative to a board through\ncumulative voting, thereby ensuring representation for all sizes of shareholders. For example, if there is a\ncompany with a ten-member board and 500 shares outstanding\u0097the total number of votes that may\nbe cast is 5,000.

Many companies have sought shareholder approval for charter or bylaw\namendments that would prohibit the removal of directors except for cause, thus ensuring that directors would\nretain their directorship for their\nfull-term unless found guilty of self-dealing. By requiring cause to be demonstrated through due process,\nmanagement insulates the directors from removal even if a director has been performing poorly, not attending\nmeetings, or not acting in the\nbest interests of shareholders.\n\n12 A proxy access right that meets the recommended guidelines.\n\n13 Indemnification: the condition of being secured against loss or damage.\nLimited liability: a person\u0092s financial liability is limited to a fixed sum, or personal financial assets\nare not at risk if the individual\nloses a lawsuit that results in financial award/damages to the plaintiff.\nExculpation: to eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director or officer to the corporation or its\nshareholders for monetary damages for breach of\nfiduciary duty as a director or officer.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Social\nAdvisory Services supports management proposals to fix the size of the board at a specific number, thus\npreventing management, when facing a proxy contest, from increasing the board size without shareholder\napproval. By increasing the size of the\nboard, management can make it more difficult for dissidents to gain control of the board.

Shareholders have expressed strong support\nfor shareholder proposals on majority threshold voting. Social Advisory Services believes shareholders\nshould have a greater voice in the\nelection of directors and believes majority threshold voting represents a viable alternative to the\nplurality system in the U.S. Companies are strongly encouraged to also adopt a post-election policy (also\nknown as a director resignation policy)\nthat will provide guidelines so that the company will promptly address the situation of a holdover director.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for precatory and binding resolutions requesting that\nthe board change the company\u0092s bylaws to stipulate that directors need to be elected with an affirmative\nmajority of votes cast, provided it does not conflict with the state law where the company is incorporated.\nBinding resolutions need to\nallow for a carve-out for a plurality vote standard when there are more nominees than board seats.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Accordingly, Social Advisory\nServices will cast votes in a manner that shall encourage the independence of boards.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking that a majority or more of directors be independent unless     \n  \u00a7    the board composition                                                                                \n       already meets the proposed threshold by Social Advisory Services\u0092 definition of independence.         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to strengthen the definition of  \n       independence for board directors.                               \n                                                                       \nEstablishment of Independent Committees\n\nMost corporate governance experts agree that the key board committees (audit, compensation, and\nnominating/corporate governance) of a corporation should include only\nindependent directors. The independence of key committees has been encouraged by regulation. Social Advisory\nServices believes that initiatives to increase the independent representation of these committees or to\nrequire that these committees be\nindependent should be supported.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for shareholder\nproposals asking that board audit, compensation, and/or nominating committees be composed exclusively of\nindependent directors.\n\nIndependent Board Chair\n\nOne of the principle functions of the board is to monitor and evaluate the performance of the CEO. The\nchairperson\u0092s\nduty to oversee management is obviously compromised when he or she is required to monitor himself or\nherself. Generally Social Advisory Services recommends a vote for shareholder proposals that would require\nthat the position of board chair be held\nby an individual with no materials ties to the company other than their board seat.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for shareholder proposals that would require the board chair\nto be independent of management.\n\nEstablishment of Board Committees\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\nGenerally vote for shareholder proposals to establish a new board committee to address broad corporate\npolicy topics or to provide a forum for ongoing dialogue on issues such as the environment, human or labor\nrights, shareholder relations,\noccupational health and safety etc. when the formation of such committees appears to be a potentially\neffective method of protecting or enhancing shareholder value. In evaluating such proposals, the following\nfactors will be considered:\n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Existing oversight mechanisms (including current committee           \n       structure) regarding the issue for which board oversight is sought;  \n                                                                            \n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Level of disclosure regarding the issue for which board oversight is  \n       sought;                                                               \n                                                                             \n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Company performance related to the issue for which board oversight  \n       is sought;                                                          \n                                                                           \n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Board committee structure compared to that of other companies in its  \n       industry sector; and                                                  \n                                                                             \n                                                 \n  \u00a7    The scope and structure of the proposal.  \n                                                 \nEstablish/Amend Nominee Qualifications\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote case-by-case on proposals that establish or amend director\nqualifications.

Ratification of Auditors\n\nAnnual election of the outside accountants is best practice standard. While it is recognized that the\ncompany is in the best position to evaluate the competence of\nthe outside accountants, we believe that outside accountants must ultimately be accountable to shareholders.\nA Blue Ribbon Commission report concluded that audit committees must improve their current level of\noversight of independent accountants.\nGiven the rash of accounting misdeeds that were not detected by audit panels or auditors, shareholder\nratification is an essential step in restoring investor confidence. Shareholders should have the right to\nweigh in on the choice of the audit firm,\nand all companies should put ratification on the ballot of their annual meeting. Special consideration will\nbe given when non-audit fees exceed audit fees, as high\nnon-audit fees can compromise the independence of the auditor. Social Advisory Services will also monitor\nboth auditor tenure and whether auditor ratification has been pulled from the ballot.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for proposals to ratify auditors, unless any of the\nfollowing apply:\n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The non-audit fees paid                                              \n       represent 25\u00a0percent or more of the total fees paid to the auditor;  \n                                                                            \n                                                                       \n  \u00a7    An auditor has a financial interest in or association with the  \n       company, and is therefore not independent;                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                  \n  \u00a7    There is reason to believe that the independent auditor has rendered                       \n       an opinion that is neither accurate nor indicative of the company\u0092s financial position; or  \n                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n       Poor accounting practices are identified that rise to a serious                                      \n  \u00a7    level of concern, such as: fraud; misapplication of GAAP; and material weaknesses identified in      \n       Section\u00a0404 disclosures.                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nAuditor-Related Shareholder Proposals\n\nRatify Auditors/Ensure Auditor Independence\n\nThese shareholder proposals request that the board allow shareholders to ratify the company\u0092s auditor at\neach annual meeting. Annual ratification of the outside accountants is standard practice. While it is\nrecognized that the company is in the best position to evaluate the competence of the outside accountants,\nwe believe that outside accountants must\nultimately be accountable to shareholders.\n\nGiven the rash of accounting irregularities that were not detected by audit panels or auditors, shareholder\nratification is an essential step in restoring investor confidence. Social Advisory Services believes that\nshareholders should have the ability to ratify the auditor on an annual basis.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                        \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to allow shareholders to vote on  \n       auditor ratification.                                            \n                                                                        \n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals that ask a company to adopt a policy on auditor  \n       independence.                                                       \n                                                                           \n                                                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals that seek to limit the non-audit services provided by the company\u0092s auditor.  \n                                                                                                       \nAuditor Rotation\n\nTo minimize any conflict of interest that may rise between the company and its auditor, Social Advisory\nServices supports the rotation of auditors. Currently, SEC\nrules provide that partners should be rotated every five years. However, Social Advisory Services also\nbelieves that the long tenure of audit firms at U.S. companies can be problematic.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for shareholder proposals to rotate company\u0092s\nauditor every five years or more. Social Advisory Services believes that proposing a rotation period less\nthan five years is unreasonably restrictive and may negatively affect audit quality and service while\nincreasing expense.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Takeover Defenses / Shareholder Rights\n\nCorporate takeover attempts come in various guises. Usually, a would-be acquirer makes a direct offer to the\nboard of\ndirectors of a targeted corporation. The bidder may offer to purchase the company for cash and/or stock. If\nthe board approves the offer, a friendly transaction is completed and presented to shareholders for\napproval. If, however, the board of\ndirectors rejects the bid, the acquirer can make a tender offer for the shares directly to the targeted\ncorporation\u0092s shareholders. Such offers are referred to as hostile tender bids.\n\nNot wishing to wait until they are subjects of hostile takeover attempts, many corporations have adopted\nantitakeover measures designed to deter unfriendly bids or\nbuy time. The most common defenses are the shareholders rights protection plan, also known as the poison\npill, and charter amendments that create barriers to acceptance of hostile bids. In the U.S., poison pills\ndo not require shareholder approval.\nHowever, shareholders must approve charter amendments, such as classified boards or supermajority vote\nrequirements. In brief, the very existence of defensive measures can foreclose the possibility of tenders\nand hence, opportunities to premium\nprices for shareholders.\n\nAnti-takeover statutes generally increase management\u0092s potential for insulating itself and warding off\nhostile takeovers that may\nbe beneficial to shareholders. While it may be true that some boards use such devices to obtain higher bids\nand to enhance shareholder value, it is more likely that such provisions are used to entrench management.\nThe majority of historical evidence\non individual corporate anti-takeover measures indicates that heavily insulated companies generally realize\nlower returns than those having managements that are more accountable to shareholders and the market. The\nevidence also suggests that when\nstates adopt their own anti-takeover devices, or endorse those employed by firms, shareholder returns are\nharmed. Moreover, the body of evidence appears to indicate that companies in states with the strongest anti-\ntakeover laws experience lower\nreturns than they would absent such statutes.\n\nTakeover Defenses and Shareholder Rights-Related Management Proposals\n\nPoison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plans)\n\nPoison pills are corporate-sponsored financial devices that, when triggered by potential acquirers, do one\nor more of the following: 1) dilute the acquirer\u0092s\nequity holdings in the target company; 2) dilute the acquirer\u0092s voting interests in the target company; or\n3) dilute the acquirer\u0092s equity holdings in the post-merger company. Poison pills generally allow\nshareholders to purchase shares\nfrom, or sell shares back to, the target company (flip-in pill) and/or the potential acquirer (flip-out\npill) at a price far out of line with fair market value.\nDepending on the type of pill, the triggering event can either transfer wealth from the target company or\ndilute the equity holdings of current shareholders. Poison pills insulate management from the threat of a\nchange in control and provide the\ntarget board with veto power over takeover bids. Because poison pills greatly alter the balance of power\nbetween shareholders and management, shareholders should be allowed to make their own evaluation of such\nplans.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on management proposals on poison pill\nratification, focusing on the features of the shareholder rights plan. Rights plans should contain the\nfollowing attributes:\n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    No lower than a 20\u00a0percent trigger, flip-in or flip-over provision;  \n                                                                            \n                                            \n  \u00a7    A term of no more than three years;  \n                                            \n                                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    No deadhand, slowhand,                                                                    \n       no-hand or similar feature that limits the ability of a future board to redeem the pill;  \n                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n       Shareholder redemption feature (qualifying offer clause); if the                                     \n  \u00a7    board refuses to redeem the pill 90 days after a qualifying offer is announced, 10\u00a0percent of the    \n       shares may call a special meeting or seek a written consent to vote on rescinding the pill.          \n                                                                                                            \nIn addition, the rationale for adopting the pill should be thoroughly explained by the company. In examining\nthe request for the pill, take into consideration the\ncompany\u0092s existing governance structure, including: board independence, existing takeover defenses, and any\nproblematic governance concerns.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

This has resulted\nin previously profitable companies considering the adoption of a poison pill and/or NOL protective amendment\nto protect their NOL tax assets, which may be lost upon an acquisition of 5 percent of a company\u0092s shares.\n\nWhen evaluating management proposals seeking to adopt NOL pills or protective amendments, the purpose behind\nthe proposal, its terms, and the company\u0092s existing\ngovernance structure should be taken into account to assess whether the structure actively promotes board\nentrenchment or adequately protects shareholder rights. While Social Advisory Services acknowledges the high\nestimated tax value of NOLs, which\nbenefit shareholders, the ownership acquisition limitations contained in an NOL pill/protective amendment\ncoupled with a company\u0092s problematic governance structure could serve as an antitakeover device.\n\nGiven the fact that shareholders will want to ensure that such an amendment does not remain in effect\npermanently, Social Advisory Services will also closely review\nwhether the pill/amendment contains a sunset provision or a commitment to cause the expiration of the NOL\npill/protective amendment upon exhaustion or expiration of the NOLs.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote against proposals to adopt a poison pill for the stated\npurpose of protecting a company\u0092s net operating losses (\u0093NOLs\u0094) if the term of the pill would exceed the\nshorter of three years and the exhaustion of the NOL.\n\nVote case-by-case on management proposals for poison pill ratification, considering\nthe following factors, if the term of the pill would be the shorter of three years (or less) and the\nexhaustion of the NOL:\n                                                                        \n  \u00a7    The ownership threshold to transfer (NOL pills generally have a  \n       trigger slightly below 5%);                                      \n                                                                        \n                               \n  \u00a7    The value of the NOLs;  \n                               \n                                                                                \n  \u00a7    Shareholder protection mechanisms (sunset provision, or commitment       \n       to cause expiration of the pill upon exhaustion or expiration of NOLs);  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n       The company\u0092s existing governance structure including: board                                          \n  \u00a7    independence, existing takeover defenses, track record of responsiveness to shareholders, and any    \n       other problematic governance concerns; and                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                  \n  \u00a7    Any other factors that may be applicable.  \n                                                  \nVote against proposals to adopt a protective amendment for the stated purpose of protecting a company\u0092s net\noperating losses (\u0093NOLs\u0094) if the effective\nterm of the protective amendment would exceed the shorter of three years and the exhaustion of the NOL.\n\nVote case-by-case, considering the following factors, for management proposals to adopt an NOL protective\namendment that would remain in effect for the shorter of three years (or less) and the exhaustion of the\nNOL:\n                                                                                                            \n       The ownership threshold (NOL protective amendments generally                                         \n  \u00a7    prohibit stock ownership transfers that would result in a new 5-percent holder or increase the       \n       stock ownership percentage of an existing five-percent holder);                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                               \n  \u00a7    The value of the NOLs;  \n                               \n                                                                                                \n  \u00a7    Shareholder protection mechanisms (sunset provision or commitment to                     \n       cause expiration of the protective amendment upon exhaustion or expiration of the NOL);  \n                                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n       The company\u0091s existing governance structure including; board                                          \n  \u00a7    independence, existing takeover defenses, track record of responsiveness to shareholders, and any    \n       other problematic governance concerns;                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                  \n  \u00a7    Any other factors that may be applicable.  \n                                                  \n                                                                \n  W W W .

These recent\ncourt decisions have encouraged companies to take a closer look at their bylaw provisions to ensure that\nbroad language does not provide\nloopholes for activist investors. Specifically, companies are including language designed to provide more\ndetailed advance notice provisions and to ensure full disclosure of economic and voting interests in a\nshareholder\u0092s notice of proposals,\nincluding derivatives and hedged positions.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote case-by-case on advance notice proposals, giving support to\nthose proposals which allow shareholders to submit proposals/nominations as close to the meeting date as\nreasonably\npossible and within the broadest window possible, recognizing the need to allow sufficient notice for\ncompany, regulatory and shareholder review.\n\nTo be\nreasonable, the company\u0092s deadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/ nominations must be no earlier than\n120 days prior to the anniversary of the previous year\u0092s meeting and have a submittal window of no shorter\nthan 30 days from the\nbeginning of the notice period (also known as a 90-120 day window).The submittal window is the period under\nwhich shareholders must file their proposals/nominations prior to the deadline.\n\nIn general, support additional efforts by companies to ensure full disclosure in regard to a proponent\u0092s\neconomic and voting position in the company so long as\nthe informational requirements are reasonable and aimed at providing shareholders with the necessary\ninformation to review such proposals.\n\n14 \u0093Unfettered\u0094 means no restrictions on agenda items, no restrictions on the number of shareholders who can\ngroup together to reach the 10 percent threshold, and only\nreasonable limits on when a meeting can be called: no greater than 30 days after the last annual meeting and\nno greater than 90 prior to the next annual meeting.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

In such a hostile takeover, the bidder offers cash\nfor enough shares to gain control of the target. At the same time the acquirer\nstates that once control has been obtained, the target\u0092s remaining shares will be purchased with cash, cash\nand securities or only securities. Since the payment offered for the remaining stock is, by design less\nvaluable than the original offer\nfor the controlling shares, shareholders are forced to sell out early to maximize their value. Standard fair\nprice provisions require that, absent board or shareholder approval of the acquisition, the bidder must pay\nthe remaining shareholders the\nsame price for their shares that brought control.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote                                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    case-by-case on proposals to adopt fair price provisions evaluating factors such as the vote         \n       required to approve the proposed acquisition, the vote required to repeal                            \n       the fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair price.                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Generally, vote against fair price provisions with shareholder vote  \n       requirements greater than a majority of disinterested shares.        \n                                                                            \nGreenmail\n\nGreenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock from individuals or groups\nseeking control of the company. Since only the hostile\nparty receives payment, usually at a substantial premium over the market value of shares, the practice\ndiscriminates against most shareholders. This transferred cash, absent the greenmail payment, could be put\nto much better use for reinvestment in\nthe company, payment of dividends, or to fund a public share repurchase program.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                        \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals to adopt antigreenmail charter or bylaw                       \n       amendments or otherwise restrict a company\u0092s ability to make greenmail payments.  \n                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Review on a case-by-case basis antigreenmail proposals when they are bundled with other charter or   \n       bylaw amendments.                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nConfidential Voting\n\nConfidential voting, or voting by secret ballot, is one of the key structural issues in the proxy system. It\nensures that all votes are based on the merits of\nproposals and cast in the best interests of fiduciary clients and pension plan beneficiaries. In a\nconfidential voting system, only vote tabulators and inspectors of election may examine individual proxies\nand ballots; management and shareholders\nare given only vote totals. In an open voting system, management can determine who has voted against its\nnominees or proposals and then re-solicit those votes before the final vote count. As a result,\nshareholders can be pressured to vote with management at companies with which they maintain, or would like\nto establish, a business relationship. Confidential voting also protects employee shareholders from\nretaliation. Shares held by employee stock\nownership plans, for example, are important votes that are typically voted by employees.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for management proposals to adopt confidential voting.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Voting rights for those shares exceeding ownership limits may only be restored\nby approval of either a majority or supermajority of disinterested shares. Thus, control share acquisition\nstatutes effectively require a\nhostile bidder to put its offer to a shareholder vote or risk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder\ncontinues buying up a large block of shares.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes                                  \n  \u00a7    unless doing so would enable the completion of a takeover that would be detrimental to               \n       shareholders.                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Vote against proposals to amend the charter to include control share  \n       acquisition provisions.                                               \n                                                                             \n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Vote for proposals to restore voting rights to the control shares.  \n                                                                           \nControl Share Cash-OutProvisions\n\nControl share cash-out statutes give dissident shareholders the right to\n\u0093cash-out\u0094 of their position in a company at the expense of the shareholder who has taken a control\nposition. In other words, when an investor crosses a preset threshold level, remaining shareholders\nare given the right to sell their shares to the acquirer, who must buy them at the highest acquiring price.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for proposals to opt out of control share cash-out statutes.\n\nDisgorgement Provisions\n\nDisgorgement provisions require an acquirer or potential acquirer of more than a certain percentage of a\ncompany\u0092s stock to disgorge, or pay back, to the company\nany profits realized from the sale of that company\u0092s stock purchased 24 months before achieving control\nstatus. All sales of company stock by the acquirer occurring within a certain period of time (between 18\nmonths and 24 months) prior to the\ninvestor\u0092s gaining control status are subject to these recapture-of-profits provisions.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for proposals to opt out of state disgorgement\nprovisions.\n\nState Takeover Statutes\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote case-by-case on proposals to opt in or out of state takeover\nstatutes (including control share acquisition statutes, control share cash-out statutes, freezeout\nprovisions, fair price provisions, stakeholder laws, poison pill endorsements, severance pay and labor\ncontract provisions, antigreenmail provisions, and disgorgement provisions).\n\nVote for opting into stakeholder protection statutes if they provide comprehensive protections for employees\nand community stakeholders. Social Advisory Services\nwould be less supportive of takeover statutes that only serve to protect incumbent management from\naccountability to shareholders and which negatively influence shareholder value.\n\nFreeze-OutProvisions\n\nFreeze-out provisions force an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a company to wait a\nspecified period of\ntime before gaining control of the company.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for\nproposals to opt out of state freeze-out provisions.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The debate over antitakeover devices\ncenters on whether these devices enhance or detract from shareholder value. One theory argues that a\ncompany\u0092s board, when armed with\nthese takeover protections, may use them as negotiating tools to obtain a higher premium for shareholders.\nThe opposing view maintains that managements afforded such protection are more likely to become entrenched\nthan to actively pursue the best\ninterests of shareholders. Such takeover defenses also serve as obstacles to the normal functioning of the\nmarketplace which, when operating efficiently, should replace incapable and poorly performing managements.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote for shareholder proposals that seek to remove\nantitakeover provisions.\n\nReimburse Proxy Solicitation Expenses\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation: Vote case-by-case on proposals to reimburse proxy solicitation\nexpenses.

Capital Structure\n\nThe equity in a corporate enterprise (that is, the residual value of the company\u0092s assets after the payment\nof all debts) belongs to the shareholders. Equity\nsecurities may be employed, or manipulated, in a manner that will ultimately enhance or detract from\nshareholder value. As such, certain actions undertaken by management in relation to a company\u0092s capital\nstructure can be of considerable\nsignificance to shareholders. Changes in capitalization usually require shareholder approval or\nratification.\n\nCommon Stock Authorization\n\nState statutes and stock exchanges require shareholder approval for increases in the number of common\nshares. Corporations increase their supply of common stock for a\nvariety of ordinary business purposes: raising new capital, funding stock compensation programs, business\nacquisitions, and implementation of stock splits or payment of stock dividends.\n\nGeneral Authorization Requests\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon proposals to increase the number of authorized\nshares of common stock that are to be used for general corporate purposes:\n                                                                                                            \n       If share usage (outstanding plus reserved) is less than 50% of the current authorized shares, vote   \n  \u00a7    for an increase of up                                                                                \n       to 50% of current authorized shares.                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       If share usage is 50% to 100% of the current authorized, vote for an increase of up to 100% of       \n  \u00a7    current authorized                                                                                   \n       shares.                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    If share usage is greater than current authorized shares, vote for an increase of up to the current  \n       share usage.                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       In the case of a stock split, the allowable increase is calculated (per above) based on the          \n  \u00a7    post-split adjusted                                                                                  \n       authorization.                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nGenerally vote against proposed increases, even if within the above ratios, if the proposal or the company\u0092s\nprior or\nongoing use of authorized shares is problematic, including, but not limited to:\n                                                                                                            \n       The proposal seeks to increase the number of authorized shares of the class of common stock that     \n  \u00a7    has superior voting                                                                                  \n       rights to other share classes;

The purpose of\npar value stock is to establish the maximum responsibility\nof a stockholder in the event that a corporation becomes insolvent. Proposals to reduce par value come from\ncertain state level requirements for regulated industries such as banks, and other legal requirements\nrelating to the payment of dividends.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for management proposals to reduce the par value of common stock unless the action is being     \n  \u00a7    taken to facilitate an                                                                               \n       anti-takeover device or some other negative corporate governance action.                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                              \n  \u00a7    Vote for management proposals to eliminate par value.  \n                                                              \nUnequal Voting Rights/Dual Class Structure\n\nIncumbent managers use unequal voting rights with the voting rights of their common shares superior to other\nshareholders in order to concentrate their power and\ninsulate themselves from the wishes of the majority of shareholders. Dual class exchange offers involve a\ntransfer of voting rights from one group of shareholders to another group of shareholders typically through\nthe payment of a preferential\ndividend. A dual class recapitalization also establishes two classes of common stock with unequal voting\nrights, but initially involves an equal distribution of preferential and inferior voting shares to current\nshareholders.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote against proposals to create a new class of common\nstock unless:\n                                                                                                            \n       The company discloses a compelling rationale for the dual-class capital structure, including: a)     \n  \u00a7    the company\u0092s                                                                                         \n       auditor has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the company\u0092s ability to continue as a    \n       going concern; or b) the new class of shares will be transitory;                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

The absence of these rights could cause stockholders\u0092 interest in a company to be reduced by the\nsale of additional shares without\ntheir knowledge and at prices unfavorable to them. Preemptive rights, however, can make it difficult for\ncorporations to issue large blocks of stock for general corporate purposes. Both corporations and\nshareholders benefit when corporations are\nable to arrange issues without preemptive rights that do not result in a substantial transfer of control.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Review on a case-by-casebasis proposals to create or abolish\npreemptive rights.

Executive and Director Compensation\n\nThe global financial crisis resulted in significant erosion of shareholder value and highlighted the need\nfor greater assurance that executive compensation is\nprincipally performance-based, fair, reasonable, and not designed in a manner that would incentivize\nexcessive risk-taking by managements. The financial crisis raised questions about the role of pay incentives\nin influencing executive behavior and\nmotivating inappropriate or excessive risk-taking that could threaten a corporation\u0091s long-term viability.\nThe safety lapses that led to the disastrous explosions at BP\u0092s Deepwater Horizon oil rig and Massey\nEnergy\u0092s Upper Big Branch\nmine, and the resulting unprecedented losses in shareholder value; a) underscore the importance of\nincorporating meaningful economic incentives around social and environmental considerations in compensation\nprogram design, and b) exemplify the\ncostly liabilities of failing to do so.\n\nEvolving disclosure requirements have opened a wider window into compensation practices and processes,\ngiving\nshareholders more opportunity and responsibility to ensure that pay is designed to create and sustain value.\nCompanies in the U.S. are now required to evaluate and discuss potential risks arising from misguided or\nmisaligned compensation programs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires advisory shareholder votes on\nexecutive compensation (management \u0093say on pay\u0094), an advisory vote on the frequency of say on pay, as well\nas a shareholder advisory vote\non golden parachute compensation. The advent of \u0093say on pay\u0094 votes for shareholders in the U.S. has provided\na new communication mechanism and impetus for constructive engagement between shareholders and\nmanagers/directors on pay issues.\n\nThe socially responsible investing community contends that corporations should be held accountable for their\nactions and decisions, including those around\nexecutive compensation. Social Advisory Services believes that executive pay programs should be fair,\ncompetitive, reasonable, and create appropriate incentives, and that pay for performance should be a central\ntenet in executive compensation\nphilosophy. Most investors expect corporations to adhere to certain best practice pay considerations in\ndesigning and administering executive and director compensation programs, including:\n                                                                                                            \n       Appropriate pay-for-performance                                                                      \n       alignment with emphasis on long-term shareholder value: executive pay practices must be designed to  \n       attract, retain, and appropriately motivate the key employees who drive shareholder value creation   \n  \u00a7    over the long term.

In addition, the policy should prohibit or discourage the use of company     \n       stock as collateral for margin loans, to avoid any potential sudden stock sales (required upon       \n       margin calls), that could have a negative impact on                                                  \n       the company\u0092s stock price.                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Long-term focus: Executive compensation programs should be designed to support companies\u0092             \n       long-term strategic goals. A short-term focus on performance does not necessarily create             \n       sustainable shareholder value, since long-term goals may be sacrificed to achieve short-term         \n       expectations. Compensation programs embedding a long-term focus                                      \n  \u00a7    with respect to company goals better align with the long-term interests of shareholders. Granting    \n       stock options and restricted stock to executives that vest in five years do not necessarily provide  \n       a long-term focus, as executives can sell the                                                        \n       company shares once they vest. However, requiring senior executives to hold company stock until      \n       they retire can encourage a long-term focus on company performance.                                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

From a shareholders\u0092 perspective, performance is predominantly gauged\nby the company\u0092s stock performance over time. Even when financial, non-financial or\noperational measures are utilized in incentive awards, the achievement related to these measures should\nultimately translate into superior shareholder returns in the long-term.

This\nnon-binding shareholder vote on compensation must be included in a proxy or consent or authorization at\nleast once every three years.\n\nIn general, the SOP ballot item is the primary focus of voting on executive pay practices \u0096 dissatisfaction\nwith compensation practices can be expressed by\nvoting against the SOP proposal rather than voting against or withhold from the compensation committee.\nHowever, if there is no SOP on the ballot, then the negative vote will apply to members of the compensation\ncommittee. In addition, in egregious\ncases, or if the board fails to respond to concerns raised by a prior SOP proposal, then Social Advisory\nServices will recommend a vote against or withhold votes from compensation committee members (or, if the\nfull board is deemed accountable, all\ndirectors). If the negative factors involve equity-based compensation, then a vote against an equity-based\nplan proposal presented for shareholder approval may be appropriate. In evaluating SOP proposals, Social\nAdvisory Services will also assess to\nwhat degree social and environmental considerations are incorporated into compensation programs and\nexecutive pay decision-making \u0096 to the extent that proxy statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis\n(CD&A) disclosures permit.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The SOP is at its\nessence\na communication vehicle, and communication is most useful when it is received in a consistent and timely\nmanner. Social Advisory Services supports an annual SOP vote for many of the same reasons it supports annual\ndirector elections rather than a\nclassified board structure: because this provides the highest level of accountability and direct\ncommunication by enabling the MSOP vote to correspond to the majority of the information presented in the\naccompanying proxy statement for the\napplicable shareholders\u0092 meeting. Having SOP votes every two or three years, covering all actions occurring\nbetween the votes, would make it difficult to create the meaningful and coherent communication that the\nvotes are intended to provide.\nUnder triennial elections, for example, a company would not know whether the shareholder vote references the\ncompensation year being discussed or a previous year, making it more difficult to understand the\nimplications of the vote.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for annual advisory votes on compensation, which provide the\nmost consistent and clear communication channel for shareholder concerns about companies\u0092 executive pay\nprograms.\n\nAdvisory Vote on Golden Parachutes in an Acquisition, Merger, Consolidation, or Proposed Sale\n\nThis is a proxy item regarding specific advisory votes on \u0093golden parachute\u0094 arrangements for Named\nExecutive Officers (NEOs) that is required under The\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Although shareholders may have little say\nabout how much the CEO is paid in salary\nand bonus, they do have a major voice in approving stock incentive plans.\n\nStock-based plans can transfer significant amounts of wealth from shareholders to\nexecutives and directors and are among the most economically significant issues that shareholders are\nentitled to vote on. Rightly, the cost of these plans must be in line with the anticipated benefits to\nshareholders. Clearly, reasonable limits\nmust be set on dilution as well as administrative authority. In addition, shareholders must consider the\nnecessity of the various pay programs and examine the appropriateness of award types. Consequently, the pros\nand cons of these proposals\nnecessitate a case-by-case evaluation.\n\nFactors that increase the cost (or have\nthe potential to increase the cost) of plans to shareholders include: excessive dilution, options awarded at\nbelow-market discounts, permissive policies on pyramiding, restricted stock giveaways that reward tenure\nrather than results, sales of\nshares on concessionary terms, blank-check authority for administering committees, option repricing or\noption replacements, accelerated vesting of awards in the event of defined changes in corporate control,\nstand-alone stock appreciation rights,\nloans or other forms of assistance, or evidence of improvident award policies.\n\nPositive plan features that can offset costly features include: plans with modest\ndilution potential (i.e. appreciably below double-digit levels), bars to pyramiding and related safeguards\nfor investor interests. Also favorable are performance programs with a duration of two or more years, bonus\nschemes that pay off in non-dilutive, fully deductible cash, 401K and other thrift or profit sharing plans,\nand tax-favored employee stock purchase plans. In general, we believe that stock plans\nshould afford incentives, not sure-fire, risk-free rewards.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

SVT is expressed as both a\ndollar amount and as a percentage of market value, and includes the new shares proposed,\n\n20 Proposals evaluated under the EPSC policy generally include those to approve or amend (1) stock option\nplans for employees and/or employees and directors, (2) restricted\nstock plans for employees and/or employees and directors, and (3) omnibus stock incentive plans for\nemployees and/or employees and directors.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

All award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are placed on the most\nexpensive types of awards (for example,\nfull value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be granted will be the most expensive types.\nSee discussion of specific types of awards.\n\nExcept for\nproposals subject to Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value Transfer is reasonable if it falls\nbelow a company-specific benchmark. The benchmark is determined as follows: The top quartile performers in\neach industry group (using the\nGlobal Industry Classification Standard: GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are\nestablished based on these top performers\u0092 historic SVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group\nto identify the variables most\nstrongly correlated to SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the\nspecific company by plugging the company-specific performance measures, size and cash compensation into the\nindustry cap equations to arrive\nat the company\u0092s benchmark.21\n\nRepricing Provisions\n\nVote against plans that expressly permit the repricing or exchange of underwater stock options/stock\nappreciate rights (SARs) without prior shareholder approval.\n\u0093Repricing\u0094 includes the ability to do any of the following:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Amend the terms of outstanding options or SARs to reduce the exercise price of such outstanding      \n       options or SARs;                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Cancel outstanding options or SARs in exchange for options or SARs with an exercise price that is    \n  \u00a7    less than the exercise                                                                               \n       price of the original options or SARs.                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                \n  \u00a7    The cancellation of underwater options in exchange for stock awards; or  \n                                                                                \n                                            \n  \u00a7    Cash buyouts of underwater options.  \n                                            \nWhile the above cover most types of repricing, Social Advisory Services may view other provisions as akin to\nrepricing depending on the facts and circumstances.\n\nAlso, vote against or withhold from members of the compensation committee who approved repricing (as defined\nabove or otherwise determined by Social Advisory\nServices), without prior shareholder approval, even if such repricings are allowed in their equity plan.\n\nVote against plans if the company has a history of\nrepricing without shareholder approval, and the applicable listing standards would not preclude them from\ndoing so.\n\nPay-for-PerformanceMisalignment \u0096 Application to Equity Plans\n\nIf the equity plan on the ballot is a vehicle for\nproblematic pay practices, vote against the plan.\n\nSocial Advisory Services may recommend a vote against the equity plan if the plan is determined to be a\nvehicle for pay-for-performance misalignment. Considerations in voting against the equity plan may include,\nbut are not limited to:\n                                            \n  \u00a7    Severity of the pay-for-performance  \n       misalignment;                        \n                                            \n                                                                                        \n  \u00a7    Whether problematic equity grant practices are driving the misalignment; and/or  \n                                                                                        \n                                                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Whether equity plan awards have been heavily concentrated to the CEO and/or the other NEOs.  \n                                                                                                    \nThree-Year Value Adjusted Burn Rate\n\nA \u0093Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\u0094 is used for stock plan evaluations. Value-Adjusted Burn Rate benchmarks will be\ncalculated as the greater of: (1) an\nindustry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the company\u0092s GICS group\n\n21 For plans evaluated under the Equity Plan Scorecard\npolicy, the company\u0092s SVT benchmark is considered along with other factors.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Year-over-year burn-rate\nbenchmark changes will be limited to a predetermined range above or below the prior year\u0092s burn-rate\nbenchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate will be calculated as follows:\n\nValue-Adjusted\nBurn Rate = ((# of options * option\u0092s dollar value using a Black-Scholes model) + (# of full-value awards *\nstock price)) / (Weighted average common shares * stock price).\n\nLiberal Definition of Change-in-Control\n\nGenerally vote against equity plans if the plan\nprovides for the acceleration of vesting of equity awards even though an actual change in control may not\noccur. Examples of such a definition could include, but are not limited to, announcement or commencement of\na tender offer, provisions for\nacceleration upon a \u0093potential\u0094 takeover, shareholder approval of a merger or other transactions, or similar\nlanguage.\n\nOther Compensation Plans\n\nAmending Cash and Equity Plans (including Approval for Tax Deductibility (162(m))\n\nCash bonus plans can be an important part of an executive\u0092s overall pay package, along with stock-based\nplans tied to\nlong-term total shareholder returns. Over the long term, stock prices are an excellent indicator of\nmanagement performance. However, other factors, such as economic conditions and investor reaction to the\nstock market in general and certain\nindustries in particular, can greatly impact the company\u0092s stock price. As a result, a cash bonus plan can\neffectively reward individual performance and the achievement of business unit objectives that are\nindependent of short-term market share\nprice fluctuations.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon amendments to cash and equity incentive plans.\n\nGenerally vote for proposals to amend executive cash, stock, or cash and stock incentive plans if the\nproposal:\n                                                   \n  \u00a7    Addresses administrative features only; or  \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n       Seeks approval for Section\u00a0162(m) purposes only, and the plan administering committee consists       \n       entirely of                                                                                          \n       independent directors, per Social Advisory Services\u0092 Categorization of Directors.

However, purchase plans are beneficial\nonly when they are well balanced and in the best interests of all shareholders. From a shareholder\u0092s\nperspective, plans with offering periods of 27 months or less are preferable. Plans with longer offering\nperiods remove too much of the market\nrisk and could give participants excessive discounts on their stock purchases that are not offered to other\nshareholders.\n\nQualified Plans\n\nQualified employee stock purchase plans qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the\nInternal Revenue Code.\nSuch plans must be broad-based, permitting all full-time employees to participate. Some companies also\npermit part-time staff to participate. Qualified ESPPs must be expensed under SFAS 123 unless the plan meets\nthe following conditions; a) purchase\ndiscount is 5 percent or below; b) all employees can participate in the program; and 3) no look-back feature\nin the program. Therefore, some companies offer nonqualified ESPPs.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon qualified employee stock purchase plans.

Also, limits are placed on employees\u0092\ncontributions. Some companies provide a maximum dollar value for the year and others specify the limits in\nterms of a percent of base salary, excluding bonus or commissions. For plans that do not qualify under\nSection 423 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, a plan participant will not recognize income by participating in the plan, but will recognize\nordinary compensation income for federal income tax purposes at the time of the purchase.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

If the company matching\ncontribution exceeds 25\npercent of employee\u0092s contribution, evaluate the cost of the plan against its allowable cap.\n\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)\n\nAn Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) is an employee benefit plan that makes the employees of a company\nalso owners of\nstock in that company. The plans are designed to defer a portion of current employee income for retirement\npurposes.\n\nThe primary difference between ESOPs and\nother employee benefit plans is that ESOPs invest primarily in the securities of the employee\u0092s company. In\naddition, an ESOP must be created for the benefit of non-management level employees and\nadministered by a trust that cannot discriminate in favor of highly paid personnel.\n\nAcademic research of the performance of ESOPs in closely held companies found\nthat ESOPs appear to increase overall sales, employment, and sales per employee over what would have been\nexpected absent an ESOP. Studies have also found that companies with an ESOP are also more likely to still\nbe in business several years later,\nand are more likely to have other retirement oriented benefit plans than comparable non-ESOP companies.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for proposals to implement an ESOP or increase authorized\nshares for existing ESOPs, unless the number of shares allocated to the ESOP is excessive (more than five\npercent of outstanding shares).\n\nOption Exchange Programs/Repricing Options\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon management proposals seeking approval to\nexchange/reprice options taking into consideration:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Historic trading patterns \u0096 the stock price should not be so volatile that the options are likely to  \n       be back \u0093in-the-money\u0094 over the near term;                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Rationale for the re-pricing \u0096 was the stock price decline beyond  \n       management\u0092s control?                                              \n                                                                         \n                                            \n  \u00a7    Is this a value-for-value exchange?  \n                                            \n                                                                      \n  \u00a7    Are surrendered stock options added back to the plan reserve?  \n                                                                      \n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Option vesting \u0096 does the new option vest immediately or is there a  \n       black-out period?                                                   \n                                                                           \n                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Term of the option \u0096 the term should remain the same as that of the replaced option;  \n                                                                                            \n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Exercise price \u0096 should be set at fair market or a premium to market;  \n                                                                             \n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Participants \u0096 executive officers and directors should be excluded.  \n                                                                           \nIf the surrendered options are added back to the equity plans for re-issuance, then also take into\nconsideration the\ncompany\u0092s total cost of equity plans and its three-year average burn rate.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The proposal should clearly articulate why the board is\nchoosing to conduct an exchange program at this point in time. Repricing underwater options after a recent\nprecipitous drop in the\ncompany\u0092s stock price demonstrates poor timing. Repricing after a recent decline in stock price triggers\nadditional scrutiny and a potential vote against the proposal. At a minimum, the decline should not have\nhappened within the past year.\nAlso, consider the terms of the surrendered options, such as the grant date, exercise price and vesting\nschedule. Grant dates of surrendered options should be far enough back (two to three years) so as not to\nsuggest that repricings are being done\nto take advantage of short-term downward price movements. Similarly, the exercise price of surrendered\noptions should be above the 52-week high for the stock price.\n\nVote for shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.\n\nStock Plans in Lieu of Cash\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote case-by-case on plans that provide                                                              \n  \u00a7    participants with the option of taking all or a portion of their cash compensation in the form of    \n       stock.                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for non-employee director-only equity plans that provide a dollar-for-dollar cash-for-stock     \n       exchange.                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote case-by-case on plans which do not                                                              \n       provide a dollar-for-dollar cash for stock exchange.

A 401(k) plan is any\nqualified plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal\nRevenue Code that contains a cash or deferred arrangement. In its simplest form, an employee can elect to\nhave a portion of his salary invested in a 401(k) plan before any income taxes are assessed. The money can\nonly be withdrawn before retirement\nunder penalty. However, because the money contributed to the plan is withdrawn before taxes (reducing the\nemployee\u0092s income tax), a properly planned 401(k) plan will enable an employee to make larger contributions\nto a 401(k) plan than to a\nsavings plan, and still take the same amount home.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for proposals to implement a 401(k) savings plan for employees.\n\nSeverance Agreements for Executives/Golden Parachutes\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote on a case-by-casebasis on proposals to ratify or cancel golden\nparachutes.

Change in control is defined as a change in the      \n       company ownership structure.                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nDirector Compensation\n\nThe board\u0092s legal charge of fulfilling its fiduciary obligations of loyalty and care is put to the ultimate\ntest through the task of the board setting its own\ncompensation. Directors themselves oversee the process for evaluating board performance and establishing pay\npackages for board members.\n\nShareholders provide\nlimited oversight of directors by electing individuals who are primarily selected by the board, or a board\nnominating committee, and by voting on stock-based plans for directors designed by the board compensation\ncommittee. Additionally,\nshareholders may submit and vote on their own resolutions seeking to limit or restructure director pay.\nWhile the cost of compensating non-employee directors is small in absolute terms, compared to the cost of\ncompensating executives, it is still a critical aspect of a company\u0092s overall corporate governance\nstructure.\n\nOverall, director pay levels are rising in\npart because of the new forms of pay in use at many companies, as well as because of the increased\nresponsibilities arising from the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. In addition to an annual retainer\nfee, many companies also pay fees for\nattending board and committee meetings, fees for chairing a committee, or a retainer fee for chairing a\ncommittee.\n\nDirector compensation packages should be\ndesigned to provide value to directors for their contribution. Given that many directors are high-level\nexecutives whose personal income levels are generally high, cash compensation may hold little\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Stock-based incentives on the other hand reinforce\nthe directors\u0092 role of protecting and enhancing shareholder value. The stock-based component of director\ncompensation should be large enough to ensure that when faced with a situation in which the interests of\nshareholders and management\ndiffer, the board will have a financial incentive to think as a shareholder. Additionally, many companies\nhave instituted equity ownership programs for directors. Social Advisory Services recommends that directors\nreceive stock grants equal to three\ntimes of their annual retainer, as it is a reasonable starting point for companies of all sizes and\nindustries. A vesting schedule for director grants helps directors to meet the stock ownership guidelines\nand maintains their long-term interests in\nthe firm.\n\nDirector compensation packages should also be designed to attract and retain competent directors who are\nwilling to risk becoming a defendant in a\nlawsuit and suffer potentially adverse publicity if the company runs into financial difficulties or is\nmismanaged.\n\nShareholder Ratification of Director Pay Programs\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon management proposals seeking ratification of\nnon-employeedirector compensation, based on the following factors:\n                                                                                       \n  \u00a7    If the equity plan under which non-employee director grants are made is on the  \n       ballot, whether or not it warrants support;

Companies\nalso disclose their compensation practices and details of their stock-based compensation plans. While this\nlevel of disclosure is helpful, it does not always provide a comprehensive picture of the company\u0092s\ncompensation practices. For\nshareholders to make informed decisions on compensation levels, they need to have clear, concise information\nat their disposal.

Nevertheless, many highly\nqualified individuals such as academics and clergy who can offer valuable perspectives in boardrooms may be\nunable to purchase individual shares\nof stock. In such a circumstance, the preferred solution is to look at the board nominees individually and\ntake stock ownership into consideration when voting on the merits of each candidate.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote against shareholder proposals that mandate a minimum\namount of stock that directors must own in order to qualify as a director or to remain on the board.\n\nProhibit/Require Shareholder Approval for Option Repricing\n\nRepricing involves the reduction of the\noriginal exercise price of a stock option after the fall in share price. Social Advisory Services does not\nsupport repricing since it undermines the incentive purpose of the plan. The use of options as an incentive\nmeans that employees must bear the\nsame risks as shareholders in holding these options. Shareholder resolutions calling on companies to abandon\nthe practice of repricing or to submit repricings to a shareholder vote will be supported.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                   \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals seeking to limit repricing.  \n                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals asking the company to have option repricings submitted for            \n       shareholder ratification.                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nSeverance Agreements/Golden Parachutes\n\nGolden parachutes are designed to protect the employees of a corporation in the event of a change in\ncontrol. With Golden Parachutes senior level management employees\nreceive a payout during a change in control at usually two to three times base salary.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals requiring that golden parachutes or\nexecutive severance agreements be submitted for shareholder ratification, unless the proposal requires\nshareholder approval prior to entering into employment contracts.\n\nCash Balance Plans\n\nA cash balance plan is a defined benefit plan that treats an earned retirement benefit as if it was a credit\nfrom a defined contribution plan, but which provides a\nstated benefit at the end of its term. Because employer contributions to these plans are credited evenly\nover the life of a plan, and not based on a seniority formula they may reduce payouts to long-term employees\nwho are currently vested in plans.\n\nCash-balance pension conversions have undergone congressional and federal agency scrutiny following high-\nprofile EEOC complaints on age discrimination and\nemployee anger at companies like IBM. While significant change is unlikely in the short-tm, business\ninterests were concerned enough that the National Association of Manufacturers and other business lobbies\nformed a Capitol Hill coalition to preserve the essential features of the plans and to overturn an IRS\nruling. Driving the push behind conversions from traditional pension plans to cash-balance plans are the\nsubstantial savings that companies\ngenerate in the process. Critics point out that these savings are gained at the expense of the most senior\nemployees. Resolutions call on corporate boards to establish a committee of outside directors to prepare a\nreport to shareholders on the\npotential impact of pension-related proposals now being considered by national policymakers in reaction to\nthe controversy spawned by the plans.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Social Advisory Services supports equity awards that provide challenging performance\nobjectives and serve to motivate executives to superior performance and as performance-contingent stock\noptions as a significant component of\ncompensation.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon shareholder proposal requesting that a\nsignificant amount of future long-term incentive compensation awarded to senior executives shall be\nperformance-based and requesting that the board adopt and disclose challenging performance metrics to\nshareholders, based on the following analytical steps:\n                                                                                                            \n       First, vote for shareholder proposals advocating the use of performance-based equity awards, such    \n       as performance                                                                                       \n       contingent options or restricted stock, indexed options or premium-priced options, unless the        \n       proposal is overly restrictive or if the company has demonstrated that it is using a \u0093substantial\u0094     \n  \u00a7    portion of performance-based awards for its                                                          \n       top executives. Standard stock options and performance-accelerated awards do not meet the criteria   \n       to be considered as performance-based awards. Further, premium-priced options should have a          \n       meaningful premium to be considered performance-based                                                \n       awards.                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Second, assess the rigor of the company\u0092s performance-based equity program. If the bar set for the    \n       performance-based                                                                                    \n       program is too low based on the company\u0092s historical or peer group comparison, generally vote for     \n  \u00a7    the proposal. Furthermore, if target performance results in an above target payout, vote for the     \n       shareholder proposal due to program\u0092s poor                                                            \n       design. If the company does not disclose the performance metric of the performance-based equity      \n       program, vote for the shareholder proposal regardless of the outcome of the first step to the test.  \n                                                                                                            \nIn general, vote for the shareholder proposal if the company does not meet both of the above two steps.\n\nPay for Superior Performance\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for shareholder proposals based on a case-by-\ncaseanalysis that requests the board establish a pay-for-superiorperformance standard in the company\u0092s\nexecutive compensation plan for senior executives.

Mergers and Corporate Restructurings\n\nA merger occurs when one corporation is absorbed into another and ceases to exist. The surviving company\ngains all the rights, privileges, powers, duties, obligations\nand liabilities of the merged corporation. The shareholders of the absorbed company receive stock or\nsecurities of the surviving company or other consideration as provided by the plan of merger. Mergers,\nconsolidations, share exchanges, and sale of\nassets are friendly in nature, which is to say that both sides have agreed to the combination or acquisition\nof assets.\n\nShareholder approval for an acquiring\ncompany is generally not required under state law or stock exchange regulations unless the acquisition is in\nthe form of a stock transaction which would result in the issue of 20 percent or more of the acquirer\u0092s\noutstanding shares or\nvoting power, or unless the two entities involved require that shareholders approve the deal. Under most\nstate laws, however, a target company must submit merger agreements to a shareholder vote. Shareholder\napproval is required in the formation of\na consolidated corporation.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nM&A analyses are inherently a balance of competing factors. Bright line rules are difficult if not\nimpossible to apply to a world where every deal is different.\nUltimately, the question for shareholders (both of the acquirer and the target) is the following: Is the\nvaluation fair? Shareholders of the acquirer may be concerned that the deal values the target too highly.\nShareholders of the target may be\nconcerned that the deal undervalues their interests.\n\nVote recommendation will be based on primarily an analysis of shareholder value, which itself can be\naffected by ancillary factors such as the negotiation process. The importance of other factors, including\ncorporate governance and social and environmental considerations however, should not fail to be recognized.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Votes on mergers and acquisitions are considered on a case-by-\ncasebasis. A review and evaluation of the merits and drawbacks of the proposed transaction is conducted,\nbalancing various and sometimes countervailing factors including:\n                                                                                                            \n       Valuation: Is the value to be received by the target shareholders (or paid by the acquirer)          \n  \u00a7    reasonable?                                                                                          \n       While the fairness opinion may provide an initial starting point for assessing valuation             \n       reasonableness, emphasis is placed on the offer premium, market reaction and strategic rationale;    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Market reaction: How has the market responded to the proposed deal?

While the number of bankruptcies has\nrisen over the past year as evidenced by many firms, including General Motors and Lehman Brothers, the\nprevalence of these reorganizations can vary year over year due to, among other things, market conditions\nand a company\u0092s ability to sustain\nits operations. Additionally, the amount of time that lapses between a particular company\u0092s entrance into\nChapter 11 and its submission of a plan of reorganization varies significantly depending on the complexity,\ntiming, and jurisdiction of\nthe particular case. These plans are often put to a vote of shareholders (in addition to other interested\nparties), as required by the Bankruptcy Code.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon proposals to common shareholders on bankruptcy\nplans of reorganization, considering the following factors including, but not limited to:\n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Estimated value and financial prospects of the reorganized company;  \n                                                                            \n                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Percentage ownership of current shareholders in the reorganized company;  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n       Whether shareholders are adequately represented in the reorganization process (particularly through  \n  \u00a7    the existence of an                                                                                  \n       official equity committee);                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The cause(s) of the bankruptcy filing, and the extent to which the plan of reorganization addresses  \n       the cause(s);                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Existence of a superior alternative to the plan of reorganization;  \n                                                                           \n                                               \n  \u00a7    Governance of the reorganized company.  \n                                               \nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Corporations (SPACs)\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon SPAC mergers and acquisitions taking into\naccount the following:\n                                                                                                            \n       Valuation: Is the value being paid by the SPAC reasonable?

Among the reasons for this change are:\n                                                                        \n  \u00a7    The number and variety of shareholder resolutions on social and  \n       environmental issues has increased;                              \n                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n       Many of the sponsors and supporters of these resolutions are large                                   \n  \u00a7    institutional shareholders with significant holdings, and therefore, greater direct influence on     \n       the outcomes;                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                          \n  \u00a7    The proposals are more sophisticated \u0096 better written, more         \n       focused, and more sensitive to the feasibility of implementation;  \n                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n       Investors now understand that a company\u0092s response to social                                          \n  \u00a7    and environmental issues can have serious economic consequences for the company and its              \n       shareholders.                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for social and environmental shareholder proposals\nthat promote good corporate citizens while enhancing long-term shareholder and stakeholder value.

In order to be able to intelligently monitor their\ninvestments shareholders often need information best provided by the company in which they have invested.\nRequests to report such\ninformation will merit support. Requests to establish special committees of the board to address broad\ncorporate policy and provide forums for ongoing dialogue on issues including, but not limited to shareholder\nrelations, the environment, human\nrights, occupational health and safety, and executive compensation, will generally be supported,\nparticularly when they appear to offer a potentially effective method for enhancing shareholder value. We\nwill closely evaluate proposals that ask the\ncompany to cease certain actions that the proponent believes are harmful to society or some segment of\nsociety with special attention to the company\u0092s legal and ethical obligations, its ability to remain\nprofitable, and potential negative\npublicity if the company fails to honor the request. Social Advisory Services supports shareholder proposals\nthat improve the company\u0092s public image, and reduce exposure to liabilities.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

In the U.S, there are many civil\nrights laws that are enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Civil Rights Act of 1964\nprohibits discrimination based on\nrace, color, religion, sex and nationality. However, discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion,\nnationality, and sexual preference continues. The SEC\u0092s revised disclosure rules now require information on\nhow boards factor diversity\ninto the director nomination process, as well as disclosure on how the board assesses the effectiveness of\nits diversity policy. Shareholder proposals on diversity may target a company\u0092s board nomination procedures\nor seek greater disclosure on\na company\u0092s programs and procedures on increasing the diversity of its workforce, and make reference to one\nor more of the following points:\n                                                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Violations of workplace anti-discrimination laws lead to expensive                                \n       litigation and damaged corporate reputations that are not in the best interests of shareholders;  \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                   \n  \u00a7    Employers already prepare employee diversity reports for the EEOC,          \n       so preparing a similar report to shareholders can be done at minimal cost;  \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n       The presence of women, ethnic minorities and union members in                                        \n  \u00a7    workforce and customer pools gives companies with diversified boards a practical advantage over      \n       their competitors as a result of their unique perspectives;                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Efforts to include women, minorities and union representatives on  \n       corporate boards can be made at reasonable costs;                  \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Reports can be prepared \u0093at reasonable expense\u0094 describing          \n       efforts to encourage diversified representation on their boards;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                                                        \n  \u00a7    Board diversification increases the pool of the company\u0092s                                         \n       potential investors because more and more investors are favoring companies with diverse boards;  \n                                                                                                        \n                                                                        \n  \u00a7    A commitment to diversity in the workforce can lead to superior  \n       financial returns.                                               \n                                                                        \nAdd Women and Minorities to the Board\n\nBoard diversification proposals ask companies to put systems in place to increase the representation of\nwomen, racial minorities, union members or other\nunderrepresented minority groups on boards of directors. In prior years, board diversification proposals\nrequested that companies nominate board members from certain constituencies, appoint special committees to\nrecommend underrepresented classes of\nboard members, establish board positions reserved for representatives of certain groups, or simply \u0093make\ngreater efforts\u0094 to nominate women and ethnic minorities to their boards.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals that ask the company to take steps to  \n       nominate more women and racial minorities to the board.               \n                                                                             \n                                                                   \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals asking for reports on board  \n       diversity.                                                  \n                                                                   \n                                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals asking companies to adopt nomination                       \n       charters or amend existing charters to include reasonable language addressing diversity.  \n                                                                                                 \nRacial Equity and/or Civil Rights Audits\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Generally vote for proposals requesting that a company conduct an\nindependent racial equity and/or civil rights audit, considering company disclosures, policies, actions, and\nengagements.\n\nReport on the Distribution of Stock Options by Gender and Race\n\nCompanies have received requests from shareholders to prepare reports documenting the distribution of the\nstock options and restricted stock awards by race and gender\nof the recipient. Proponents of these proposals argue that, in the\n                                                                \n  W W W . I S S G O V E R N A N C E .

The appearance of these\nproposals is also in response to the nationwide wage gap and under representation of minorities and women at\nthe highest levels of\ncompensation.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals asking companies to report on the\ndistribution of stock options by race and gender of the recipient.\n\nPrepare Report/Promote EEOC-Related Activities\n\nFilers of proposals on this issue generally ask a company to make available, at reasonable cost and\nomitting proprietary information, data the company includes in its annual report to the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) outlining the make-up of its workforce by race, gender and position.\nShareholders also ask companies to report on any efforts they are making to advance the representation of\nwomen and ethnic minorities in jobs in which they have been historically underrepresented, such as sales and\nmanagement. The costs of violating\nfederal laws that prohibit discrimination by corporations are high and can affect corporate earnings. The\nEqual Opportunities Employment Commission does not release the companies\u0092 filings to the public, unless it\nis involved in litigation, and\nthis information is difficult to obtain from other sources. Companies need to be sensitive to minority\nemployment issues as the new evolving work force becomes increasingly diverse. This information can be\nprovided with little cost to the company\nand does not create an unreasonable burden on management.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals that ask the company to report on its  \n       diversity and/or affirmative action programs.                         \n                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals calling for legal and regulatory                                      \n  \u00a7    compliance and public reporting related to non-discrimination, affirmative action, workplace health  \n       and safety, and labor policies and practices that effect long-term corporate performance.            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals requesting nondiscrimination in  \n       salary, wages and all benefits.                                 \n                                                                       \n                                                                   \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals calling for action on equal  \n       employment opportunity and antidiscrimination.              \n                                                                   \nReport on Progress Towards Glass Ceiling Commission Recommendations\n\nIn November 1995, the Glass Ceiling Commission (Commission), a bipartisan panel of leaders from business and\ngovernment,\nissued a report describing \u0093an unseen yet unbreachable barrier that keeps women and minorities from rising\nto the upper rungs of the corporate ladder.\u0094 The Commission recommended that companies take practical steps\nto rectify this\ndisparity, such as including diversity goals in business plans, committing to affirmative action for\nqualified employees and initiating family-friendly labor policies.

Although an increasing number of US companies have\nexplicitly banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in their equal\nemployment opportunity (EEO) statements, many\nstill do not. Shareholder proponents and other activist groups concerned with gay and lesbian rights,\n                                                                \n  W W W . I S S G O V E R N A N C E .

Shareholder proposals on this topic ask companies to change the\nlanguage of their EEO statements in\norder to put in place anti-discrimination protection for their gay and lesbian employees. In addition,\nproposals may seek disclosure on a company\u0092s general initiatives to create a workplace free of\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation, including reference to such items as support of gay and lesbian employee groups, diversity\ntraining that addresses sexual orientation, and non-medical benefits to domestic partners of gay and\nlesbian employees.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                   \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to include language in EEO statements                        \n       specifically barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.  \n                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals seeking reports on a company\u0092s                                         \n  \u00a7    initiatives to create a workplace free of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or       \n       gender identity.                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Vote against shareholder proposals that seek to eliminate protection  \n       already afforded to gay and lesbian employees.                        \n                                                                             \nReport on/Eliminate Use of Racial Stereotypes in Advertising\n\nMany companies continue to use racial stereotypes or images perceived as racially insensitive in their\nadvertising\ncampaigns. Filers of shareholder proposals on this topic often request companies to give more careful\nconsideration to the symbols and images that are used to promote the company.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals seeking more careful consideration of\nusing racial stereotypes in advertising campaigns, including preparation of a report on this issue.\n\nGender, Race, or Ethnicity Pay Gap\n\nOver the past several years, shareholders have filed resolutions\nrequesting that companies report whether a gender, race, or ethnicity pay gap exists, and if so, what\nmeasures are being taken to eliminate the gap. While primarily filed at technology firms, in 2017, the\nresolutions were also filed at firms in the\nfinancial services, insurance, healthcare, and telecommunication sectors. Proponents are expected to\ncontinue this campaign by engaging companies and filing shareholder proposals on this issue.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for requests for reports on a company\u0092s pay data by gender,\nrace, or ethnicity, or a report on a company\u0092s policies and goals to reduce any gender, race, or ethinicity\npay gap.\n\nLabor and Human Rights\n\nInvestors, international human rights groups, and labor advocacy groups have long been making attempts to\nsafeguard worker rights in the international marketplace. In\ninstances where companies themselves operate factories in developing countries for example, these advocates\nhave asked that the companies adopt global corporate standards that guarantee sustainable wages and safe\nworking conditions for their workers\nabroad. Companies that contract out portions of their manufacturing operations to foreign companies have\nbeen asked to ensure that the products they receive from those contractors have not been made using forced\nlabor, child labor, or sweatshop\nlabor. These companies are asked to adopt formal vendor standards that, among other things, include some\nsort of monitoring mechanism. Globalization, relocation of production overseas, and widespread use of\nsubcontractors and vendors, often make it\ndifficult to obtain a complete picture of a company\u0092s labor practices in global markets. Recent deadly\naccidents at factories, notably in Bangladesh and in Pakistan, have continued to intensify these concerns.\nMany investors believe that\ncompanies would benefit from adopting a human rights policy based on the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights and the International Labour Organization\u0092s Core Labor Standards. Efforts that seek greater\ndisclosure on a company\u0092s global\nlabor practices, including its supply chain, and that seek to establish minimum standards for a company\u0092s\noperations will be supported. In addition, requests for independent monitoring of overseas operations will\nbe supported.\n                                                                \n  W W W . I S S G O V E R N A N C E .

The use of child, sweatshop, or forced labor is unethical and can damage corporate\nreputations. Poor labor practices can lead to litigation against the company, which can be costly and time\nconsuming.\n\nCodes of Conduct and Vendor Standards\n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of shareholder proposals have been submitted that pertain to the\nadoption of codes of conduct or provision, greater disclosure on a company\u0092s international workplace\nstandards, or that request human rights risk assessment. Companies have been asked to adopt a number of\ndifferent types of codes, including a\nworkplace code of conduct, standards for international business operations, human rights standards,\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) standards and the SA 8000 principles. The ILO is an independent\nagency of the United Nations which consists\nof 187 member nations represented by workers, employers, and governments. The ILO\u0092s general mandate is to\npromote a decent workplace for all individuals. The ILO sets international labor standards in the form of\nits conventions and then\nmonitors compliance with the standards. The seven conventions of the ILO fall under four broad categories:\nRight to organize and bargain collectively, Nondiscrimination in employment, Abolition of forced labor, and\nEnd of child labor. Each of the\n187 member-nations of the ILO is bound to respect and promote these rights to the best of their abilities.\nSA 8000 is a set of labor standards, based on the principles of the ILO conventions and other human rights\nconventions, and covers eight\nworkplace conditions, including: child labor, forced labor, health and safety, freedom of association and\nthe right to collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours and compensation.\nThe Global Sullivan Principles are\na set of guidelines that support economic, social and political justice by companies where they do business;\nto support human rights and to encourage equal opportunity at all levels of employment.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n

The principles were established to\naddress the sectarian hiring problems between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. It is well\ndocumented that Northern Ireland\u0092s Catholic community faced much higher unemployment figures than the\nProtestant community. In response to\nthis problem, the U.K. government instituted the New Fair Employment Act of 1989 (and subsequent amendments)\nto address the sectarian hiring problems.\n\nMany\ncompanies believe that the Act adequately addresses the problems and that further action, including adoption\nof the MacBride Principles, only duplicates the efforts already underway. In evaluating a proposal to adopt\nthe MacBride Principles,\nshareholders must decide whether the principles will cause companies to divest, and therefore worsen the\nunemployment problem, or whether the principles will promote equal hiring practices.

In order to improve their\nstanding with indigenous groups and decrease any negative publicity companies may face, some concerned\nshareholders have sought reports requesting that companies review their obligations, actions and presence on\nthese groups. Some have also\nrequested these companies adopt policies based on the Draft UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous\nPeoples and the Organization of American States\u0092 (OAS) American Declaration on rights of Indigenous Peoples.\nSome companies such as Starbucks\nhave reached agreements with local governments to ensure better business practices for products produced by\nindigenous groups.

Through a practice known as off-shoring, the\noutsourcing or moving of manufacturing and service operations to foreign markets with lower labor costs,\ncompanies have found one method where the perceived savings potential is quite substantial. Shareholder\nopponents of outsourcing argue that there may be long-term consequences to offshore outsourcing that\noutweigh short-term benefits such as\nbacklash from a public already sensitive to off-shoring, security risks from information technology\ndevelopment overseas, and diminished employee morale. Shareholder proposals addressing outsourcing ask that\ncompanies prepare a report to shareholders evaluating the risk to the company\u0092s brand name and reputation in\nthe U.S. from outsourcing and off-shoring of manufacturing and service work to other countries.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholders proposals asking companies to report on the\nrisks associated with outsourcing or off-shoring.\n\nReport on the Impact of Health Pandemics on Company Operations\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is the most affected region in the world with regard to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

The U.S. government has active trade sanction regimes in place\nagainst a number of countries, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria, among others. These\nsanctions are enforced by the Office\nof Foreign Assets Control, which is part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. However, these countries do\nnot comprise an exhaustive list of countries considered to be high-risk markets.\n\nShareholder proponents have filed resolutions addressing a variety of concerns around how investments and\noperations in high-risk regions may support, or be perceived\nto support, potentially oppressive governments. Proponents contend that operations in these countries may\nlead to potential reputational, regulatory, and/or supply chain risks as a result of operational\ndisruptions. Concerned shareholders have\nrequested investment withdrawals or cessation of operations in high-risk markets as well as reports on\noperations in high-risk markets. Such reports may seek additional disclosure from companies on criteria\nemployed for investing in, continuing to\noperate in, and withdrawing from specific countries.\n\nDepending on the country\u0092s human rights record, investors have also asked companies to refrain from\ncommencing new projects in the country of concern until improvements are made. In addition, investors have\nsought greater disclosure on the nature of a company\u0092s involvement in the country and on the impact of their\ninvolvement or operations.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for requests for a review of and a report outlining the\ncompany\u0092s potential financial and reputation risks associated with operations in \u0093high-risk\u0094 markets, such\nas a terrorism-sponsoring state or otherwise, taking into account:\n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    The nature, purpose, and scope of the operations and business       \n       involved that could be affected by social or political disruption;  \n                                                                           \n                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Current disclosure of applicable risk assessment(s) and risk  \n       management procedures;                                        \n                                                                     \n                                                 \n  \u00a7    Compliance with U.S. sanctions and laws;  \n                                                 \n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Consideration of other international policies, standards, and laws;  \n                                                                            \n                                                                      \n  \u00a7    Whether the company has been recently involved in significant  \n       controversies or violations in \u0093high-risk\u0094 markets.              \n                                                                      \n                                                                \n  W W W .

On Oct. 13, 2011, the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a guidance document about the disclosure obligations\nrelating to cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents. In the document, the SEC references the negative\nconsequences that are associated with\ncyber-attacks, such as: remediation costs, including those required to repair relationships with customers\nand clients; increased cyber-security protection costs; lost revenues from unauthorized use of the\ninformation or missed opportunities to\nattract clients; litigation; and reputational damage. The document says that while the federal securities\nlaws do not explicitly require disclosure of cybersecurity risks and incidents, some disclosure requirements\nmay impose an obligation on the\ncompany to disclose such information and provides scenarios where disclosure may be required. A 2013 study\nby the Ponemon Institute found that the median annualized cost of cyber-attacks for the 60 organizations\nstudied was $11.6 million. The\nstudy also found that the number of successful cyber-attacks among the 60 companies increased by 18 percent\nbetween 2012 and 2013, from 102 successful attacks on average per week to 122.\n\nMore recently, data security has been the focus of media outlets and a public concern. During the 2013\nholiday shopping season, Target, Neiman Marcus, and other\nretailers were the targets of hackers looking to steal credit card numbers. It is estimated that as many as\n40 million customer credit and debit card accounts were stolen at Target alone. These incidents preceded\nwhat many people consider the\nlargest data security breach in the United States. In June 2013, major media outlets began releasing\ninformation about leaked classified documents disclosed by Edward Snowden, an NSA contractor. The documents\nrevealed a government-run Internet and telephone surveillance program aimed at collecting metadata. As part\nof this operation, the government is said to have obtained from major U.S. telecommunications companies the\ncall\nrecords of their customers.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for resolutions requesting the disclosure and implementation of\nInternet privacy and censorship policies and procedures considering:\n                                                                                                    \n  \u00a7    The level of disclosure of policies and procedures relating to                               \n       privacy, freedom of speech, Internet censorship, and government monitoring of the Internet;  \n                                                                                                    \n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Engagement in dialogue with governments and/or relevant groups with  \n       respect to the Internet and the free flow of information;            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The scope of business involvement and of investment in markets that  \n       maintain government censorship or monitoring of the Internet;        \n                                                                            \n                                                                         \n  \u00a7    The market-specific laws or regulations applicable to Internet    \n       censorship or monitoring that may be imposed on the company; and  \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n  \u00a7    The level of controversy or litigation related to the company\u0092s  \n       international human rights policies and procedures.             \n                                                                       \nDisclosure on Plant Closings\n\nShareholders have asked that companies contemplating plant closures consider the impact of such closings on\nemployees and the community, especially\nwhen such plan closures involve a community\u0092s largest employers.

Scientists\ngenerally agree that gases released by\nchemical reactions including the burning of fossil fuels contribute to a \u0093greenhouse effect\u0094 that traps the\nplanet\u0092s heat. Environmentalists claim that the Greenhouse Gases(GHG) produced by the industrial age have\ncaused recent\nweather crises such as heat waves, rainstorms, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and receding coastlines.\nClimate change skeptics have described the rise and fall of global temperatures as naturally occurring\nphenomena and depicted human impact on\nclimate change as minimal. Shareholder proposals requesting companies to issue a report to shareholders, \u0093at\nreasonable cost and omitting proprietary information,\u0094 on greenhouse gas emissions ask that the report\ninclude descriptions of\ncorporate efforts to reduce emissions, companies\u0092 financial exposure and potential liability from operations\nthat contribute to global warming, their direct or indirect efforts to promote the view that global warming\nis not a threat, and their\ngoals in reducing these emissions from their operations. Shareholder proponents argue that there\n\n22 Variations of this request also include climate\ntransition related ambitions, or commitment to reporting on the implementation of a climate plan.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Increased use of renewable energy will reduce the negative\nenvironmental impact of energy companies. In addition, as supplies of oil and coal exist in the earth in\nlimited quantities, renewable energy\nsources represent a competitive, and some would argue essential, long-term business strategy.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                         \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals seeking the preparation of a report                \n       on a company\u0092s activities related to the development of renewable energy sources.  \n                                                                                         \n                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals seeking increased investment in                       \n       renewable energy sources unless the terms of the resolution are overly restrictive.  \n                                                                                            \nEnergy Efficiency\n\nReducing the negative impact to the environment can be done through the use of more energy efficient\npractices and products. Shareholders propose that corporations\nshould have energy efficient manufacturing processes and should market more energy efficient products. This\ncan be done by utilizing renewable energy sources that are cost-competitive and by implementing energy\nefficient operations.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals requesting a report on company energy\nefficiency policies and/or goals.\n\nEnvironment\n\nProposals addressing environmental and energy concerns are plentiful, and generally seek greater disclosure\non a particular issue or seek to improve a\ncompany\u0092s environmental practices in order to protect the world\u0092s natural resources. In addition, some\nproponents cite the negative financial implications for companies with poor environmental practices,\nincluding liabilities associated\nwith site clean-ups and lawsuits, as well as arguments that energy efficient products and clean\nenvironmental practices are sustainable business practices that will contribute to long-term shareholder\nvalue.\nShareholders proponents point out that the majority of independent atmospheric scientists agree that global\nwarming poses a serious problem to the health and welfare of our planet, citing the findings of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Shareholder activists argue that companies\ncan report on their greenhouse gas emissions within a few months at reasonable cost. The general trend\nindicates a movement towards encouraging companies to have proactive environmental policies, focusing on\nmaximizing the efficient use of non-renewable resources and minimizing threats of harm to human health or\nthe environment.\n\nEnvironmental/Sustainability Reports\n\nShareholders may request general environmental disclosures or reports on a specific location/operation,\noften\nrequesting that the company detail the environmental risks and potential liabilities of a specific project.\nIncreasingly, companies have begun reporting on environmental and sustainability issues using the Global\nReporting Initiative (GRI)\nstandards. The GRI was established in 1997 with the mission of developing globally applicable guidelines for\nreporting on economic, environmental, and social performance. The GRI was developed by Ceres(formerly known\nas the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, CERES) in partnership with the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP).\n\nCeres was formed in the wake of the March 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, when a consortium of investors,\nenvironmental groups, and\nreligious organizations drafted what were originally named the Valdez Principles. Later to be renamed the\nCERES Principles, and now branded as the Ceres Roadmap 2030, corporate signatories to the Ceres Roadmap 2030\npledge to publicly report on\nenvironmental issues, including protection of the biosphere, sustainable use of natural resources, reduction\nand disposal of wastes, energy conservation, and employee and community risk reduction in a standardized\nform.\n\nThe Equator Principles are the financial industry\u0092s benchmark for determining, assessing and managing social\nand environmental risk in project financing. The\nPrinciples were first launched in June 2003 and were ultimately adopted by over forty financial institutions\nduring a three year implementation period.

Alberta\u0092s\noil sands contain a reserve largely thought to be one of the world\u0092s largest potential energy sources.\nRising oil sands production in Alberta has been paralleled with concerns from a variety of\nstakeholders\u0097including environmental groups,\nlocal residents, and shareholders\u0097regarding the environmental impacts of the complicated extraction and\nupgrading processes required to convert oil sands into a synthetic crude oil. The high viscosity of bitumen\nmakes its extraction a\nchallenging and resource-intensive process; the most common extraction technique involves pumping steam into\nthe oil sands to lower the viscosity of bitumen in order to pump it to the surface.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Oil sands are by far one of the most\nenergy-intensive forms of oil production, releasing three times more GHG emissions from production than\nconventional oil.\n\nShareholders have kept up pressure on the issue of potential long-term risks to companies posed by the\nenvironmental, social, and economic challenges associated with\nCanadian oil sands operations. Resolutions on the topic have focused on requesting greater transparency on\nthe ramifications of oil sands development projects.\n\nArctic National Wildlife Refuge\n\nThe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is a federally protected\nwilderness along Alaska\u0092s North Slope. In the past, legislation proposed in both the House and Senate that,\nif passed, would allow a portion of this area to be leased to private companies for development and\nproduction of oil, has been\nwitnessed. Oil companies have expressed an interest in bidding for these leases given the opportunity. In\nresponse, shareholder activists have filed resolutions asking these companies to cancel any plans to drill\nin the ANWR and cease their lobbying\nefforts to open the area for drilling. Proponents of shareholder proposals on this issue argue that the\nCoastal Plain section of the ANWR is the most environmentally sensitive area of the refuge, that the\nmajority of Alaska\u0092s North Slope that\nis not federally designated wilderness already provides the oil industry with sufficient resources for oil\nproduction, and that advocates of drilling in ANWR overstate the benefit to be derived from opening the\nwilderness to oil production. Those in\nfavor of opening the area up to drilling note that only a small portion of ANWR would be considered for\nexploration, and if drilling were to take place, it would be on less than one percent of the entire area,\nthat modern technology reduces the\nenvironmental impact of oil drilling on both the land and surrounding wildlife, and that oil production in\nANWR would have considerable benefit to company shareholders, Alaskans, and the United States as a whole.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Vote for requests for reports on potential environmental damage as a  \n       result of company operations in protected regions.                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking companies to prepare reports                                   \n  \u00a7    or adopt policies on operations that include mining, drilling or logging in environmentally          \n       sensitive areas.                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals seeking to curb or reduce the sale of                                 \n  \u00a7    products manufactured from materials extracted from environmentally sensitive areas such as old      \n       growth forests.                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nHydraulic Fracturing\n\nShareholder proponents have elevated concerns on the use of hydraulic fracturing, an increasingly\ncontroversial process in\nwhich water, sand, and a mix of chemicals are blasted horizontally into tight layers of shale rock to\nextract natural gas. As this practice has gained more widespread use, environmentalists have raised concerns\nthat the chemicals mixed with sand and\nwater to aid the fracturing process can contaminate ground water supplies. Proponents of resolutions at\ncompanies that employ hydraulic fracturing are also concerned that wastewater produced by the process could\noverload the waste treatment plants\nto which it is shipped. Shareholders have asked companies that utilize hydraulic fracturing to report on the\nenvironmental impact of the practice and to disclose policies aimed at reducing hazards from the process.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for requests seeking greater transparency on the practice of\nhydraulic fracturing and its associated risks.\n\nPhase Out Chlorine-Based Chemicals\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identified chlorine bleaching of pulp and paper as a major source\nof dioxin, a\nknown human carcinogen linked to have negative effects to humans and animals. A number of shareholder\nproposals have been filed in recent years asking companies to report on the possible phase-out of chlorine\nbleaching in the production of paper because of the practice\u0092s negative environmental impact.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Shareholder proponents, activists and even some legislators have called upon\ndrug companies to restrain pricing of prescription drugs.\n\nThe high cost of prescription drugs is a vital issue for senior citizens across the country. Seniors have\nthe greatest need for prescription drugs, accounting for a\nsignificant portion of all prescription drug sales, but they often live on fixed incomes and are\nunderinsured.\n\nProponents note that efforts to reign-in pharmaceutical costs will not negatively impact research and\ndevelopment (R&D) costs and that retail drug prices are consistently higher in the U.S. than in other\nindustrialized nations. Pharmaceutical\ncompanies often respond that adopting a formal drug pricing policy could put the company at a competitive\ndisadvantage.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the AIDS crisis\nin Africa, many shareholders have called on companies to address the issue of affordable drugs for the\ntreatment of AIDS, as well as tuberculosis and malaria throughout the developing world. When analyzing such\nresolutions, consideration should be\nmade of the strategic implications of pricing policies in the market.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to prepare a report on drug pricing.  \n                                                                            \n                                                                        \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to adopt a formal policy on drug  \n       pricing.                                                         \n                                                                        \n                                                                                                        \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals that call on companies to develop a                               \n       policy to provide affordable HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria drugs in third-world nations.  \n                                                                                                        \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Shareholders have asked companies to renounce the future development of landmines or their\ncomponents, or to prepare a report on the feasibility of such a renouncement.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals seeking a report on the renouncement\nof future landmine production.\n\nPrepare Report on Foreign Military Sales\n\nShareholders have filed proxy resolutions asking companies to account for their policies surrounding the\nsale of military\nequipment to foreign governments. The proposals can take various forms. One resolution simply calls on\ncompanies to report on their foreign military sales, provide information on military product exports,\ndisclose the company\u0092s basis for\ndetermining whether those sales should be made, and any procedures used to market or negotiate those sales.\nAnother resolution calls for companies to report on \u0093offsets\u0094 e.g. guarantee of new jobs in the purchasing\ncountry and technology\ntransfers. Offsets involve a commitment by military contractors and the U.S. government to direct benefits\nback to a foreign government as a condition of a military sale.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to report on foreign military sales  \n       or offset agreements.                                               \n                                                                           \n                                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Vote                                                                                      \n       case-by-case on proposals that call for outright restrictions on foreign military sales.  \n                                                                                                 \nDepleted Uranium/Nuclear Weapons\n\nDepleted uranium is the less radioactive uranium that is left behind after enriched uranium is produced for\nnuclear reactor fuel and fissile material for nuclear\nweapons. The main difference is that depleted uranium contains at least three times less U-235 than natural\nuranium. However, it is still weakly radioactive. Shareholders want reports on companies\u0092\npolicies, procedures and involvement in the said substance and nuclear weapons.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals requesting a report on involvement,\npolicies, and procedures related to depleted uranium and nuclear weapons.\n\nAdopt Ethical Criteria for Weapons Contracts\n\nShareholders have requested that companies review their code of conduct and statements of ethical criteria\nfor military production-related contract bids, awards, and\nexecution to incorporate environmental factors and sustainability issues\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Sustainability is a\nbusiness model that requires companies to balance the needs and interests of various stakeholders while\nconcurrently sustaining their businesses, communities, and the environment for future generations.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals asking companies to review and amend,\nif necessary, the company\u0092s code of conduct and statements of ethical criteria for military production-\nrelated contract bids, awards and execution.\n\nAnimal Welfare\n\nAnimal Rights/Testing\n\nShareholders and animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical\nTreatment of Animals (PETA), may file resolutions calling for the end to painful and unnecessary animal\ntesting on laboratory animals by companies developing products for the cosmetics and medical supply\nindustry. Since advanced testing methods now\nproduce many reliable results without the use of live animals, Social Advisory Services generally supports\nproposals on this issue. In cases where it can be determined that alternative testing methods are unreliable\nor are required by law, Social\nAdvisory Services recommends voting against such proposals. Other resolutions call for the adoption of\nanimal welfare standards that would ensure humane treatment of animals on vendors\u0092 farms and slaughter\nhouses. Social Advisory Services will\ngenerally vote in favor of such resolutions.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals that seek to limit unnecessary animal          \n       testing where alternative testing methods are feasible or not barred by law.  \n                                                                                     \n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals that ask companies to adopt or/and    \n       report on company animal welfare standards or animal-related risks.  \n                                                                            \n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals asking companies to report on the    \n       operational costs and liabilities associated with selling animals.  \n                                                                           \n                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to eliminate cruel product testing  \n       methods.                                                           \n                                                                          \n                                                                                 \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals that seek to monitor, limit, report,       \n       or eliminate the outsourcing of animal testing to overseas laboratories.  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                             \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to adopt or adhere to a public animal  \n       welfare policy at both company and contracted laboratory levels.      \n                                                                             \n                                                                                  \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to evaluate, adopt, or require              \n       suppliers to adopt Controlled Atmosphere Killing (CAK) slaughter methods.  \n                                                                                  \nPolitical and Charitable Giving\n\nLobbying Efforts\n\nShareholders have asked companies to report on their lobbying efforts on proposed legislation or to refute\nestablished scientific research regarding climate change,\nthe health effects of smoking, fuel efficiency standards etc. Proponents have pointed to potential\nlegislation on climate change, the lethargic pace of improvements in fuel efficiency standards in the U.S.\nautomotive industry, and the highly\nlitigious nature surrounding the tobacco industry as rationales for greater transparency on corporate\nlobbying practices that would shed light on whether companies are acting in the best long-term interests of\ntheir shareholders.

However, some resolutions extend beyond mere disclosure requests and\nattempt to influence or restrict companies\u0092 contributions to specific types of beneficiaries in a manner\nthat furthers particular\nobjectives supported by the proposal sponsors. Social Advisory Services believes that management is better\npositioned to decide what criteria are appropriate for making corporate charitable contributions. Also, some\nof the proposals may require\ncompanies to poll their shareholders as part of the grant-making process. Since majority of companies\ngenerally have thousands of shareholders, contacting, confirming, and processing each individual opinion\nand/or consent would be a burdensome and\nexpensive exercise.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                    \n  \u00a7    Generally vote for shareholder resolutions seeking enhanced  \n       transparency on corporate philanthropy.                      \n                                                                    \n                                                                      \n  \u00a7    Vote against shareholder proposals imposing charitable giving  \n       criteria or requiring shareholder ratification of grants.      \n                                                                      \n                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Vote against shareholder proposals requesting that companies  \n       prohibit charitable contributions.                            \n                                                                     \nDisclosure on Prior Government Service\n\nShareholders have asked companies to disclose the identity of any senior executive and/or other high-level\nemployee, consultant, lobbyist, attorney, or investment\nbanker who has served in government. Although the movement of individuals between government and the private\nsector may benefit both, the potential also exists for conflicts of interest, especially in industries that\nhave extensive dealings with\ngovernment agencies.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals calling for the disclosure of prior\ngovernment service of the company\u0092s key executives.\n\nConsumer Lending and Economic Development\n\nAdopt Policy/Report on Predatory Lending Practices\n\nPredatory lending involves charging excessive fees to subprime borrowers without adequate disclosure. More\nspecifically, predatory lending includes\nmisleading subprime borrowers about the terms of a loan, charging excessive fees that are folded into the\nbody of a refinancing loan, including life insurance policies or other unnecessary additions to a mortgage,\nor lending to homeowners with\ninsufficient income to cover loan payments.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals seeking the development of a policy\nor preparation of a report to guard against predatory lending practices.\n\nDisclosure on Credit in Developing Countries (LDCs) or Forgive LDC Debt\n\nShareholders have asked banks and other financial services firms to develop and disclose lending policies\nfor less developed countries. Proponents are concerned that,\nwithout such policies, lending to developing countries may contribute to the outflow of capital, the\ninefficient use of capital, and corruption, all of which increase the risk of loan loss. In the interest of\npromoting improved LDC lending practices\nand responsible loan disclosure, Social Advisory Services generally supports voting for such proposals. In\ncases where it can be determined that companies have been proactive and responsible in developing policies,\nSocial Advisory Services may\nrecommend a vote against the proposal\u0092s adoption. Social Advisory Services usually opposes proposals that\ncall for outright loan forgiveness; such action represents an unacceptable loss to lending institutions and\ntheir shareholders. Social\nAdvisory Services may support such proposals at banks that have failed to make reasonable provisions for\nnon-performing loans as a means to encourage a change in policy.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

However, with the consolidation of the communications industry, a number of large companies\nhave ended up with ownership of cable companies. These cable companies may offer their customers access to\npay-per-view programming or channels intended for adult audiences. Proponents of shareholder proposals on\nthis issue ask cable companies and companies with interests in cable companies to assess the costs and\nbenefits of continuing to distribute sexually-explicit content, including the potential negative impact on\nthe company\u0092s image.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals that seek a review of the company\u0092s\ninvolvement with pornography.\n\nAbortion/Right to Life Issues\n\nShareholder proposals pertaining to abortion and right to life issues are rare. However, in the past\nshareholders have asked companies to stop manufacturing\nabortifacient drugs; to separate abortifacient drug operations from other operations; or to discontinue\nacute-care or physician management practices that involve support for abortion services. As long as abortion\nis legal, Social Advisory\nServices\u0092 position is that issues related to abortion should be a personal decision, not a corporate one.\nTherefore Social Advisory Services recommends abstaining on anti-abortion and right-to-life proposals.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Abstain on shareholder proposals that address right to life issues.\n\nAnti-Social Proposals\n\nA number of \u0091anti-social\u0092 shareholder proposals have been filed at companies requesting increased\ndisclosure.\nWhile these proposals\u0092 requests are very similar to those submitted by shareholder advocates within\ntraditional socially responsible investor circles, the underlying motives for filing the proposals appear to\nbe very different. In addition to\ncharitable contribution proposals, anti-social proposals addressing climate change, sustainability, and\nconflicts of interest may be seen at shareholder meetings. Despite implicitly different motivations in some\nof these proposals, the underlying\nrequests for increased disclosure, in some cases, may be worth shareholder support.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The\nEntertainment Software Ratings Board, which provides ratings for video games, has classified approximately\n34 percent of the total games it reviews as either Teen, Mature, or Adults Only.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals asking for reports on company\npolicies related to the sale of mature-rated video games to children and teens.\n\nLink Compensation to Non-FinancialFactors\n\nProponents of these proposals feel that social and\nenvironmental criteria should be factored into the formulas used in determining executive compensation\npackages. The shareholder sponsors of the resolutions look to companies to review current compensation\npractices and to include social or\nenvironmental performance criteria such as accounting for \u0093poor corporate citizenship\u0094 and meeting\nenvironmental or workplace safety objectives and metrics when evaluating executive compensation. Some of the\nnon-financial criteria that proponents of these resolutions seek to be incorporated in compensation program\ndesign include workplace safety, environmental stewardship, or diversity and customer/employee\nsatisfaction \u0096 as part of a written policy used to align compensation with performance on non-financial\nfactors alongside financial criteria.\n\nProponents believe that factors such as poor environmental performance, workplace lawsuits, etc. could have\na significant adverse impact on a company\u0092s financial\nperformance if not proactively and adequately addressed, and that these factors should be considered along\nwith traditional financial considerations when determining executive pay. The significant stock price\ndeclines and massive losses in\nshareholder value stemming from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster and the tragic explosion at Massey\nEnergy\u0092s Upper Big Branch mine that killed 29 employees is a sobering reminder of the need to have the right\nmanagement incentives in\nplace to ensure that social and environmental risks are actively managed and mitigated against. Given the\nproliferation of derivative lawsuits targeted at firms such as Halliburton, Transocean and Cameron\nInternational that were suppliers to or\npartners with BP in a capacity that ignored safety considerations or that contributed to the economic and\necological disaster, investors are increasingly mindful of the far-reaching implications that exposure\nto social or environmental risks could have on shareholder value at portfolio companies.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals calling for linkage of executive pay                                  \n  \u00a7    to non-financial factors including performance against social and environmental goals,               \n       customer/employee satisfaction, corporate downsizing, community involvement, human rights, or        \n       predatory lending.                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals seeking reports on linking executive  \n       pay to non-financial factors.                                        \n                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Whereas investment managers have traditionally analyzed topics such\nas board accountability and executive compensation to mitigate risk, greater numbers are incorporating ESG\nperformance into their investment\nmaking decisions in order to have a more comprehensive understanding of the overall risk profile of the\ncompanies in which they invest and ensure sustainable long-term profitability for their beneficiaries.\n\nInvestors concerned with portfolio value preservation and enhancement through the incorporation of\nsustainability factors can also carry out this active ownership\napproach through their proxy voting activity. In voting their shares, sustainability-minded investors are\nconcerned not only with economic returns to shareholders and good corporate governance, but also with\nensuring corporate activities and\npractices are aligned with the broader objectives of society. These investors seek standardized reporting on\nESG issues, request information regarding an issuer\u0092s adoption of, or adherence to, relevant norms,\nstandards, codes of conduct or\nuniversally recognized international initiatives including affirmative support for related shareholder\nresolutions advocating enhanced disclosure and transparency.\n\nISS\u0092 Sustainability Proxy Voting Guidelines\n\nISS has, therefore,\ndeveloped proxy voting guidelines that are consistent with the objectives of sustainability-minded investors\nand fiduciaries. On matters of ESG import, ISS\u0092 Sustainability Policy seeks to promote support for\nrecognized global governing bodies\npromoting sustainable business practices advocating for stewardship of environment, fair labor practices,\nnon-discrimination, and the protection of human rights. Generally, ISS\u0092 Sustainability Policy will take as\nits frame of reference\ninternationally recognized sustainability-related initiatives such as the United Nations Environment\nProgramme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI), United\nNations Global Compact, Global\nReporting Initiative (GRI), Carbon Principles, International Labour Organization Conventions (ILO), Ceres\nRoadmap 2030, Global Sullivan Principles, MacBride Principles, and environmental and social European Union\nDirectives. Each of these efforts\npromote a fair, unified and productive reporting and compliance environment which advances positive\ncorporate ESG actions that promote practices that present new opportunities or that mitigate related\nfinancial and reputational risks.\n\nOn matters of corporate governance, executive compensation, and corporate structure, the Sustainability\nPolicy guidelines are based on a commitment to create and\npreserve economic value and to advance principles of good corporate governance.\n\nThese guidelines provide an overview of how ISS approaches proxy voting issues\nfor subscribers of the Sustainability Policy. We note there may be cases in which the final vote\nrecommendation at a particular company varies from the voting guidelines due to the fact that we closely\nexamine the merits of each proposal and\nconsider relevant information and company-specific circumstances in arriving at our decisions. To that end,\nISS engages with both interested shareholders as well as issuers to gain further insight into contentious\nissues facing the company.

All appropriate nominees (except new) may be held accountable.\n\nRemoval of Shareholder Discretion on Classified Boards:The company has opted into, or failed to opt out of,\nstate laws requiring a classified board structure.\n\nDirector Performance Evaluation:The board lacks mechanisms to promote accountability and oversight, coupled\nwith sustained poor performance relative to peers. Sustained poor performance is measured by one-, three-,\nand five-year total shareholder returns in the bottom half of a company\u0092s four-digit GICS industry group\n(Russell 3000 companies only).

Current interim officers are included in this category. For private companies, the\nequivalent positions are applicable. A\nnon-employee director serving as an officer due to statutory requirements (e.g. corporate secretary) will be\nclassified as an Affiliated Outsider under \u0093Any material relationship with the company.\u0094 However, if the\ncompany provides explicit\ndisclosure that the director is not receiving additional compensation in excess of $10,000 per year for\nserving in that capacity, then the director will be classified as an Independent Outsider.\n\n[2] \u0093Affiliate\u0094 includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or\nparent company. Sustainability Advisory Services uses 50 percent control ownership by the parent company as\nthe standard for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor of an externally managed issuer\n(EMI) is considered an affiliate.\n\n[3] Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the\ncompany\u0092s initial public offering (IPO).\n\n[4] When there is\na former CEO of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) serving on the board of an acquired company,\nSustainability Advisory Services will generally classify such directors as independent unless determined\notherwise taking into account the\nfollowing factors: the applicable listing standards determination of such director\u0092s independence; any\noperating ties to the firm; and the existence of any other conflicting relationships or related party\ntransactions.\n\n[5]Sustainability Advisory Services will look at the terms of the\ninterim officer\u0092s employment contract to determine if it contains severance pay, long-term health and\npension benefits, or other such standard provisions typically contained in contracts of permanent, non-\ntemporary CEOs. Sustainability Advisory\nServices will also consider if a formal search process was under way for a full-time officer at the time.\n\n[6]\u0093Immediate family member\u0094 follows the SEC\u0092s definition of such and covers spouses, parents, children,\nstep-parents, step-children, siblings, in-laws, and any person (other\nthan a tenant or employee) sharing the household of any director, nominee for director, executive officer,\nor significant shareholder of the company.\n\n[7] Professional services can be characterized as advisory in\nnature, generally involve access to sensitive company information or to strategic decision-making, and\ntypically have a commission- or fee-based payment structure. Professional services generally include, but\nare not limited to the following:\ninvestment banking/financial advisory services; commercial banking (beyond deposit services); investment\nservices; insurance services; accounting/audit services; consulting services; marketing services; legal\nservices; property management services;\nrealtor services; lobbying services; executive search services; and IT consulting services. The following\nwould generally be considered transactional relationships and not professional services: deposit services;\nIT tech support services;\neducational services; and construction services. The case of participation in a banking syndicate by a non-\nlead bank should be considered a transactional (and hence subject to the associated materiality test) rather\nthan a professional relationship.\n\u0093Of Counsel\u0094 relationships are only considered immaterial if the individual does not receive any form of\ncompensation (in excess of $10,000 per year) from, or is a retired partner of, the firm providing the\nprofessional service. The case\nof a company providing a professional service to one of its directors or to an entity with which one of its\ndirectors is affiliated, will be considered a transactional rather than\n\na professional relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be professional\nservices unless the company\nexplains why such services are not advisory.\n\n[8] A material\ntransactional relationship, including grants to non-profit organizations, exists if the company makes annual\npayments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity exceeding the greater of $200,000 or 5 percent\nof the recipient\u0092s gross\nrevenues, in the case of a company which follows NASDAQ listing standards; or the greater of $1,000,000 or 2\npercent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues, in the case of a company which follows NYSE listing standards. In\nthe case of a company\nwhich follows neither of the preceding standards, Sustainability Advisory Services will apply the NASDAQ-\nbased materiality test.

The board chair\u0092s duty to oversee\nmanagement may be compromised when he/she is connected to or a part of the management team. Generally,\nSustainability Advisory Services recommends supporting shareholder proposals that would require that the\nposition of board chair be held by an\nindividual with no materials ties to the company other than their board seat.\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Generally, support shareholder proposals that would require the board\nchair to be independent of management.\n\nMajority of Independent Directors/Establishment of Independent Committees\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Vote for shareholder proposals asking that a majority or more of\ndirectors be independent unless the board composition already meets the proposed threshold by the\nSustainability policy\u0092s definition of\nindependent outsider.

Vote against if no carve-out for a plurality vote\nstandard in contested elections is included.\n\nGenerally vote for precatory and binding shareholder resolutions requesting that the board change the\ncompany\u0092s bylaws to stipulate that directors need to be\nelected with an affirmative majority of votes cast, provided it does not conflict with the state law where\nthe company is incorporated. Binding resolutions need to allow for a carve-out for a plurality vote standard\nwhen there are more nominees than\nboard seats.\n\nCompanies are strongly encouraged to also adopt a post-election policy (also known as a director resignation\npolicy) that will provide guidelines so\nthat the company will promptly address the situation of a holdover director.\n\nProxy Access\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Generally vote for management and shareholder proposals for\nproxy access with the following provisions:\n                                                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Ownership threshold: maximum requirement not more than three percent (3%)\u00a0of the voting power;  \n                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n       Ownership duration: maximum requirement not longer than three (3)\u00a0years of continuous ownership for  \n  \u00a7    each                                                                                                 \n       member of the nominating group;                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Aggregation: minimal or no limits on the number of shareholders permitted to form a nominating       \n       group;                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                  \n  \u00a7    Cap: cap on nominees of generally twenty-five percent (25%)\u00a0of the board.  \n                                                                                  \nReview for reasonableness any other restrictions on the right of proxy access.\n\nGenerally vote against proposals that are more restrictive than these guidelines.\n\nRequire More Nominees than Open Seats\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Vote against shareholder proposals that would require a company\nto nominate more candidates than the number of open board seats.\n\nShareholder Engagement Policy (Shareholder Advisory Committee)\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Generally vote for\nshareholder proposals requesting that the board establish an internal mechanism/process, which may include a\ncommittee, in order to improve communications between directors and shareholders, unless the company has the\nfollowing features, as\nappropriate:\n                                                                                                            \n       Established a communication structure that goes beyond the exchange requirements to facilitate the   \n  \u00a7    exchange of                                                                                          \n       information between shareholders and members of the board;                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                              \n  \u00a7    Effectively disclosed information with respect to this structure to its shareholders;  \n                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Company has not ignored majority-supported shareholder proposals or a majority withhold vote on a    \n       director nominee; and                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Shareholder Rights & Defenses\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals/Nominations\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Vote case-by-case on\nadvance notice proposals, giving support to those proposals which allow shareholders to submit\nproposals/nominations as close to the meeting date as reasonably possible and within the broadest window\npossible, recognizing the need to allow\nsufficient notice for company, regulatory, and shareholder review.\n\nTo be reasonable, the company\u0092s deadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/nominations\nmust be no earlier than 120 days prior to the anniversary of the previous year\u0092s meeting and have a\nsubmittal window of no shorter than 30 days from the beginning of the notice period (also known as a 90-120\nday window). The submittal window is\nthe period under which shareholders must file their proposal/nominations prior to the deadline.\n\nIn general, support additional efforts by companies to ensure\nfull disclosure in regard to a proponent\u0092s economic and voting position in the company so long as the\ninformational requirements are reasonable and aimed at providing shareholders with the necessary information\nto review such proposals.\n\nAmend Bylaws without Shareholder Consent\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Vote against proposals giving the board exclusive authority to\namend the bylaws.\n\nVote for proposals giving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition to shareholders.\n\nControl Share Acquisition Provisions\n\nControl share acquisition statutes function by denying shares their voting rights when they contribute to\nownership in excess of certain thresholds. Voting rights for\nthose shares exceeding ownership limits may only be restored by approval of either a majority or\nsupermajority of disinterested shares. Thus, control share acquisition statutes effectively require a\nhostile bidder to put its offer to a shareholder\nvote or risk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder continues buying up a large block of shares.\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Vote for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition\nstatutes unless doing so would enable the completion of a takeover that would be detrimental to\nshareholders.\n\nVote against proposals to amend the charter to\ninclude control share acquisition provisions.\n\nVote for proposals to restore voting rights to the control shares.\n\nControl Share Cash-Out Provisions\n\nControl share cash-out statutes give dissident shareholders the right to \u0093cash-out\u0094 of their position in a\ncompany at the expense of the shareholder who has\ntaken a control position. In other words, when an investor crosses a preset threshold level, remaining\nshareholders are given the right to sell their shares to the acquirer, who must buy them at the highest\nacquiring price.\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Vote for proposals to opt out of control share cash-out\nstatutes.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

All sales of company stock by the acquirer occurring within a certain period of time (between 18\nmonths and 24 months) prior to the\ninvestor\u0092s gaining control status are subject to these recapture-of-profits provisions.\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Vote for proposals to opt out of state disgorgement provisions.\n\nFair Price Provisions\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Vote case-by-case on proposals\nto adopt fair price provisions (provisions that stipulate that an acquirer must pay the same price to\nacquire all shares as it paid to acquire the control shares), evaluating factors such as the vote required\nto approve the proposed acquisition, the\nvote required to repeal the fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair price.\n\nGenerally vote against fair price provisions with shareholder\nvote requirements greater than a majority of disinterested shares.\n\nFreeze-Out Provisions\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Vote for proposals to opt out of state freeze-out provisions.\nFreeze-out provisions force an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a company to wait a\nspecified period of time before gaining control of the company.\n\nGreenmail\n\nGreenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock from individuals or groups\nseeking control of the company. Since only the hostile\nparty receives payment, usually at a substantial premium over the market value of its shares, the practice\ndiscriminates against all other shareholders.\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Vote for proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments\nor otherwise restrict a company\u0092s ability to make greenmail payments.\n\nVote case-by-case on anti-greenmail proposals when they are bundled with other charter or bylaw amendments.\n\nShareholder Litigation Rights\n\nFederal Forum Selection Provisions\n\nFederal forum selection provisions require that U.S. federal courts be the sole forum for shareholders to\nlitigate claims arising under federal securities law.\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Generally vote for federal forum selection provisions in the\ncharter or bylaws that specify \u0093the district courts of the United States\u0094 as the exclusive forum for federal\nsecurities law matters, in the absence of serious concerns about corporate governance or board\nresponsiveness to shareholders.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

unilateral adoption of such a provision will generally be\nconsidered a one-time failure under the Unilateral Bylaw/Charter Amendments policy.\n\nFee Shifting\n\nFee-shifting provisions in the charter or bylaws require that a shareholder who sues a company\nunsuccessfully pay all litigation expenses of the defendant corporation\nand its directors and officers.\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Generally vote against\nprovisions that mandate fee-shifting whenever plaintiffs are not completely successful on the merits (i.e.,\nincluding cases where the plaintiffs are partially successful).\n\nUnilateral adoption of a fee-shifting provision will generally be considered an ongoing failure under the\nUnilateral Bylaw/Charter Amendments and Problematic Capital Structurespolicy.\n\nNet Operating Loss (NOL) Protective Amendments\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation:Vote against proposals to adopt a protective amendment for the\nstated purpose of protecting a company\u0092s net operating losses (NOL) if the effective term of the protective\namendment would exceed the shorter of three years and the exhaustion of the NOL.\n\nVote case-by-case, considering the following factors, for management proposals to adopt an NOL protective\namendment that would remain in effect for the shorter of\nthree years (or less) and the exhaustion of the NOL:\n                                                                                                            \n       The ownership threshold (NOL protective amendments generally prohibit stock ownership transfers      \n  \u00a7    that would result in a                                                                               \n       new 5-percent holder or increase the stock ownership percentage of an existing 5-percent holder);

A fair process helps to ensure the best price for shareholders.          \n  \u00a7    Significant negotiation \u0093wins\u0094 can also signify the deal makers\u0092 competency.

As the result of potential conflicts, the directors and     \n       officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a merger than if they did not hold     \n       these interests. Consider whether these interests may                                                \n       have influenced these directors and officers to support or recommend the merger.                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Governance - Will the combined company have a better or worse governance profile than the current    \n  \u00a7    governance profiles of the respective parties to the transaction? If the governance profile is to    \n       change for the worse, the burden is on the company to prove that other issues (such as valuation)    \n       outweigh any deterioration in governance.                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nPrivate Placements/Warrants/Convertible Debentures\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Vote case-by-case on proposals regarding private placements,\nwarrants, and convertible debentures taking into consideration:\n                                                                                                            \n       Dilution to existing shareholders\u0092 position: The amount and timing of shareholder ownership dilution  \n       should be                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    weighed against the needs and proposed shareholder benefits of the capital infusion.

Evaluate the valuation,      \n       market reaction, and potential conflicts of interest for deals that are announced close to the       \n       liquidation date.                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Negotiations and process\u0097What was the process undertaken to identify potential target companies       \n  \u00a7    within                                                                                               \n       specified industry or location specified in charter?

Also, there     \n       may be sense of urgency by the management team of the SPAC to close the deal since its charter       \n       typically requires a transaction to be completed within                                              \n       the 18-24 month timeframe.                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Voting agreements\u0097Are the sponsors entering into enter into any voting agreements/ tender offers      \n  \u00a7    with                                                                                                 \n       shareholders who are likely to vote against the proposed merger or exercise conversion rights?       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                       \n  \u00a7    Governance\u0097What is the impact of having the SPAC CEO or founder on key committees following the  \n       proposed merger?                                                                                \n                                                                                                       \nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Corporations (SPACs) - Proposals for Extensions\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation: Vote case-by-case on SPAC extension\nproposals taking into account the length of the requested extension, the status of any pending\ntransaction(s) or progression of the acquisition process, any added incentive for non-redeeming\nshareholders, and any prior extension requests.\n                                                                                                            \n       Length of request: Typically, extension requests range from two to six months, depending on the      \n  \u00a7    progression                                                                                          \n       of the SPAC\u0092s acquistion process.                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Pending transaction(s) or progression of the acquisition process: Sometimes an intial business       \n       combination                                                                                          \n  \u00a7    was already put to a shareholder vote, but, for varying reasons, the transaction could not be        \n       consummated by the termination date and the SPAC is requesting an extension.

Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are established based\non these top performers\u0092 historic\nSVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most strongly correlated\nto SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the specific company by\nplugging the company-specific\nperformance measures, size and cash compensation into the industry cap equations to arrive at the company\u0092s\nbenchmark.\n\nThree-Year Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\n\nA \u0093Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\u0094 is used for stock plan evaluations. Value-Adjusted Burn Rate benchmarks are\ncalculated as the greater of: (1) an\nindustry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the company\u0092s GICS group segmented by S&P\n500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&P 500) and non-Russell 3000 index; and (2) a de minimisthreshold\nestablished\nseparately for each of the S&P 500, the Russell 3000 index less the S&P 500, and the non-Russell 3000 index.\nYear-over-year burn-rate benchmark changes will be limited to a predetermined range above or below the prior\nyear\u0092s burn-rate\nbenchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate will be calculated as follows:\n\nValue-Adjusted Burn Rate = ((# of options * option\u0092s dollar value using a Black-Scholes model) + (# of full-\nvalue awards * stock price)) / (Weighted average\ncommon shares * stock price).\n\nEgregious Factors\n\nLiberal Change in Control Definition\n\nGenerally vote against equity plans if the plan has a liberal definition of change in control and the equity\nawards could vest upon such liberal definition of\nchange-in-control, even though an actual change in control may not occur. Examples of such a definition\ninclude, but are not limited to, announcement or commencement of a tender offer, provisions for acceleration\nupon a \u0093potential\u0094\ntakeover, shareholder approval of a merger or other transactions, or similar language.\n\nRepricing Provisions\n\nVote against plans that expressly permit the repricing or exchange of underwater stock options/stock\nappreciate rights (SARs) without prior\nshareholder approval. \u0093Repricing\u0094 includes the ability to do any of the following:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Amend the terms of outstanding options or SARs to reduce the exercise price of such outstanding      \n       options or SARs;                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Cancel outstanding options or SARs in exchange for options or SARs with an exercise price that is    \n  \u00a7    less than the exercise                                                                               \n       price of the original options or SARs;                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                   \n  \u00a7    Cancel underwater options in exchange for stock awards; or  \n                                                                   \n                                                    \n  \u00a7    Provide cash buyouts of underwater options.  \n                                                    \nFor plans evaluated under the Equity Plan Scorecard policy, the company\u0092s SVT benchmark is considered along\nwith other factors.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The proposal should\nclearly articulate why the board is choosing to conduct an exchange program at this point in time. Repricing\nunderwater options after a recent precipitous drop in the company\u0092s stock price demonstrates poor timing.\nand warrants additional\nscrutiny. Also, consider the terms of the surrendered options, such as the grant date, exercise price and\nvesting schedule. Grant dates of surrendered options should be far enough back (two to three years) so as\nnot to suggest that repricings are\nbeing done to take advantage of short-term downward price movements. Similarly, the exercise price of\nsurrendered options should be above the 52-week high for the stock price.\n\nVote for shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.\n\nStock Plans in Lieu of Cash\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on plans that provide participants with the option of\ntaking all or a portion of their cash compensation in the form of stock.\n\nVote for non-employee director-only\nequity plans that provide a dollar-for-dollar cash-for-stock exchange.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Standard stock options and performance-accelerated awards do not meet the criteria   \n       to be considered as performance-based awards. Further, premium-priced options should have a          \n       meaningful premium to be considered performance-based                                                \n       awards.                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Second, assess the rigor of the company\u0092s performance-based equity program.

Furthermore, if target performance results in an above target payout, vote for the     \n       shareholder proposal due to program\u0092s poor                                                            \n       design. If the company does not disclose the performance metric of the performance-based equity      \n       program, vote for the shareholder proposal regardless of the outcome of the first step to the test.  \n                                                                                                            \nIn general, vote for the shareholder proposal if the company does not meet both of the above two steps.\n\nPay for Superior Performance\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation:Vote case-by-case on shareholder proposals that request the board\nestablish a pay-for-superior performance standard in the company\u0092s executive compensation plan for senior\nexecutives.

Many companies have adopted policies that\npermit recoupment in cases where an executive\u0092s fraud, misconduct, or negligence significantly contributed\nto a restatement of financial results that led to the awarding of unearned incentive compensation. However,\nsuch policies may be narrow given that not all misconduct or negligence may result in significant financial\nrestatements. Misconduct, negligence or lack of sufficient oversight by senior executives may lead to\nsignificant financial loss or reputational damage that may have long-lasting impact.\n\nIn considering whether to support such shareholder proposals, the\nfollowing factors will be taken into consideration:\n                                                               \n  \u00a7    If the company has adopted a formal recoupment policy;  \n                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n       The rigor of the recoupment policy focusing on how and under what circumstances the company may      \n  \u00a7    recoup incentive or stock                                                                            \n       compensation;                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Whether the company has chronic restatement history or material financial problems;  \n                                                                                            \n                                                                                                  \n  \u00a7    Whether the company\u0092s policy substantially addresses the concerns raised by the proponent;  \n                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Disclosure of recoupment of incentive or stock compensation from senior executives or lack thereof;  \n       or                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                    \n  \u00a7    Any other relevant factors.  \n                                    \n                                                                \n  W W W .

Social and Environmental Issues\n\nGlobal Approach\n\nSocially responsible shareholder resolutions receive a great deal more attention from institutional\nshareholders today than in the past. While focusing on value\nenhancement through risk mitigation and exposure to new sustainability-related opportunities, these\nresolutions also seek standardized reporting on ESG issues, request information regarding an issuer\u0092s\nadoption of, or adherence to, relevant\nnorms, standards, codes of conduct or universally recognized international initiatives to promote disclosure\nand transparency. ISS\u0092 Sustainability Policy generally supports standards-based ESG shareholder proposals\nthat enhance long-term\nshareholder and stakeholder value while aligning the interests of the company with those of society at\nlarge. In particular, the policy will focus on resolutions seeking greater transparency and/or adherence to\ninternationally recognized standards\nand principles.\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation:In determining our vote recommendation on standardized ESG reporting\nshareholder proposals, we also analyze the following factors:\n                                                                   \n  \u00a7    Whether the proposal itself is well framed and reasonable;

Scientists\nagree that gases released by chemical reactions including\nthe burning of fossil fuels contribute to a \u0093greenhouse effect\u0094 that traps the planet\u0092s heat.\nEnvironmentalists claim that the greenhouse gases produced by the industrial age have caused recent weather\ncrises such as heat waves,\nrainstorms, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and receding coastlines. With notable exceptions, business\nleaders have described the rise and fall of global temperatures as naturally occurring phenomena and\ndepicted corporate impact on climate\nchange as minimal.

Indeed, the term sustainability is complex and poses significant challenges for companies\non many levels. Many in the investment community have termed this broader responsibility the \u0093triple bottom\nline,\u0094 referring to the\ntriad of performance goals related to economic prosperity, social responsibility and environmental quality.\nIn essence, the concept requires companies to balance the needs and interests of their various stakeholders\nwhile operating in a manner that\nsustains business growth for the long-term, supports local communities and protects the environment and\nnatural capital for future generations.\n\nShareholders may\nrequest general environmental reports or reports on a specific location/operation, often requesting that the\ncompany detail the environmental risks and potential liabilities of a specific project. Companies have begun\nto report on environmental and\nsustainability issues using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. The GRI was established in 1997\nwith the missionof developing globally applicable guidelines for reporting on economic, environmental, and\nsocial performance. The GRI was developed byCeres(formerly known as the Coalition for Environmentally\nResponsible Economies, CERES) in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation:\n                                                                                                            \n       Vote for shareholder proposals seeking greater disclosure on the company\u0092s environmental and social   \n  \u00a7    practices,                                                                                           \n       and/or associated risks and liabilities.                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals asking companies to report in accordance with the Global Reporting    \n       Initiative (GRI).                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                           \n  \u00a7    Vote for shareholder proposals to prepare a sustainability report.  \n                                                                           \nWater Issues\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation:Generally vote for on proposals requesting a company to report on, or\nto adopt a new policy on, water-related risks and concerns, taking into account:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The company\u0092s current disclosure of relevant policies, initiatives, oversight mechanisms, and water   \n       usage metrics;                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Whether or not the company\u0092s existing water-related policies and practices are consistent with        \n  \u00a7    relevant                                                                                             \n       internationally recognized standards and national/local regulations;                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The potential financial impact or risk to the company associated with water-related concerns or      \n       issues; and                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Recent, significant company controversies, fines, or litigation regarding water use by the company   \n       and its suppliers.                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nEquator Principles\n\nThe Equator Principles are the financial industry\u0092s benchmark for determining, assessing and managing social\nand environmental risk in project financing.

In\ninstances where companies themselves operate factories in developing countries for example, these advocates\nhave asked that the companies adopt global corporate human rights standards that guarantee sustainable wages\nand safe working conditions for\ntheir workers abroad. Companies that contract out portions of their manufacturing operations to foreign\ncompanies have been asked to ensure that the products they receive from those contractors have not been made\nusing forced labor, child labor, or\nsweatshop labor. These companies are asked to adopt formal vendor standards that, among other things,\ninclude monitoring or auditing mechanisms. Globalization, relocation of production overseas, and widespread\nuse of subcontractors and vendors,\noften make it\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Many Investors believe that companies would benefit from adopting a human\nrights policy based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization\u0092s\nCore Labor Standards.\nEfforts that seek greater disclosure on a company\u0092s labor practices and that seek to establish minimum\nstandards for a company\u0092s operations will be supported. In addition, requests for independent monitoring of\noverseas operations will be\nsupported.\n\nThe Sustainability Policy generally supports proposals that call for the adoption and/or enforcement of\nprinciples or codes relating to countries in\nwhich there are systematic violations of human rights; such as the use of slave, child, or prison labor; a\ngovernment that is illegitimate; or there is a call by human rights advocates, pro-democracy organizations,\nor legitimately-elected\nrepresentatives for economic sanctions. The use of child, sweatshop, or forced labor is unethical and can\ndamage corporate reputations. Poor labor practices can lead to litigation against the company, which can be\ncostly and time consuming.\n\nHuman Rights Proposals\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation:\n

They request companies operating abroad to\nsupport the equal employment opportunity policies that apply in facilities they operate domestically. The\nprinciples were established to address the sectarian hiring problems between Protestants and Catholics in\nNorthern Ireland. It is well\ndocumented that Northern Ireland\u0092s Catholic community faced much higher unemployment figures than the\nProtestant community. In response to this problem, the U.K. government instituted the New Fair Employment\nAct of 1989 (and subsequent\namendments) to address the sectarian hiring problems.\n\nMany companies believe that the Act adequately addresses the problems and that further action, including\nadoption of the MacBride Principles, only duplicates the efforts already underway. In evaluating a proposal\nto adopt the MacBride Principles, shareholders must decide whether the principles will cause companies to\ndivest, and therefore worsen the\nunemployment problem, or whether the principles will promote equal hiring practices. Proponents believe that\nthe Fair Employment Act does not sufficiently address the sectarian hiring problems. They argue that the\nMacBride Principles serve to\nstabilize the situation and promote further investment.\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation:Support the MacBride Principles for operations in Northern Ireland that\nrequest companies to abide by equal employment opportunity policies.\n\nCommunity Social and Environmental Impact Assessments\n\nSustainability Policy Recommendation:Generally vote for requests for reports outlining policies and/or the\npotential (community) social and/or environmental impact of company operations considering:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Current disclosure of applicable policies and risk assessment report(s) and risk management          \n       procedures;

Coverage generally includes corporate actions for common equity\nholders, such as written consents and bankruptcies.

Board of Directors\n\nVoting on Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections\n\nFour fundamental principles apply when determining votes on director nominees:\n\nIndependence:Boards should be sufficiently independent from management (and significant shareholders) to\nensure that they are able and motivated to effectively supervise management\u0092s performance for the benefit of\nall shareholders, including in setting and monitoring the execution of corporate strategy, with appropriate\nuse of shareholder capital, and in setting and monitoring executive compensation programs that support that\nstrategy. The chair of the board should ideally be an independent director, and all boards should have an\nindependent leadership position or a similar role in order to help provide appropriate counterbalance to\nexecutive management, as well as having sufficiently independent committees that focus on key governance\nconcerns such as audit, compensation, and nomination of directors.\n\nComposition:Companies should ensure that directors add value to the board through their specific skills and\nexpertise and by having sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. Boards should be of a size\nappropriate to accommodate diversity, expertise, and independence, while ensuring active and collaborative\nparticipation by all members. Boards should be sufficiently diverse to ensure consideration of a wide range\nof perspectives.\n\nResponsiveness:Directors should respond to investor input, such as that expressed through significant\nopposition to management proposals, significant support for shareholder proposals (whether binding or non-\nbinding),and tender offers where a majority of shares are tendered.\n\nAccountability:Boards should be sufficiently accountable to shareholders, including through transparency of\nthe company\u0092s governance practices and regular board elections, by the provision of sufficient information\nfor shareholders to be able to assess directors and board composition, and through the ability of\nshareholders to remove directors.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for director nominees, except under the following circumstances (with\nnew nominees 1considered on case-by-casebasis):\n\nIndependence\n\nVote against2 or withhold from non-independent directors\n(Executive Directors and Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors per ) when:\n                                                                        \n  \u00a7    Independent directors comprise 50\u00a0percent or less of the board;  \n                                                                        \n                                                                                      \n  \u00a7    The non-independent director serves on the audit, compensation, or nominating  \n       committee;                                                                     \n                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so that the full board functions   \n       as that committee; or                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       The company lacks a formal nominating committee, even if the board attests that the independent      \n  \u00a7    directors fulfill the                                                                                \n       functions of such a committee.                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n1 A \u0093new nominee\u0094 is a director who is being presented\nfor election by shareholders for the first time. Recommendations on new nominees who have served for less\nthan one year are made on a case-by-case basis depending on the\ntiming of their appointment and the problematic governance issue in question.\n\n2 In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use\n\u0093Withhold\u0094 as the contrary vote option in director elections; companies with a majority vote standard use\n\u0093Against\u0094. However, it will vary by company and the proxy must be checked to determine the valid contrary\nvote option for\nthe particular company.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The\ndefinition of officer will generally follow that of a \u0093Section 16 officer\u0094 (officers subject to Section 16\nof the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934) and includes the chief executive, operating, financial, legal,\ntechnology, and\naccounting officers of a company (including the president, treasurer, secretary, controller, or any vice\npresident in charge of a principal business unit, division, or policy function). Current interim officers\nare included in this category. For\nprivate companies, the equivalent positions are applicable. A non-employee director serving as an officer\ndue to statutory requirements (e.g. corporate secretary) will generally be classified as a Non-Independent\nNon-Executive Director under \u0093Any material relationship with the company.\u0094 However, if the company provides\nexplicit disclosure that the director is\nnot receiving additional compensation exceeding $10,000 per year for serving in that capacity, then the\ndirector will be classified as an Independent Director.\n\n2. \u0093Affiliate\u0094 includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. ISS uses 50 percent control\nownership by the parent\ncompany as the standard for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor of an externally managed\nissuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate.\n\n3.Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the company\u0092s initial public offering (IPO).\n\n4. When there is a former CEO of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) serving on the board of an\nacquired company, ISS will generally\nclassify such directors as independent unless determined otherwise taking into account the following\nfactors: the applicable listing standards determination of such director\u0092s independence; any operating ties\nto the firm; and the existence of\nany other conflicting relationships or related party transactions.\n\n5. ISS will look at the terms of the interim officer\u0092s employment\ncontract to determine if it contains severance pay, long-term health and pension benefits, or other such\nstandard provisions typically contained in contracts of permanent, non-temporary CEOs. ISS will also\nconsider if a formal search process was under way for a full-time officer at the time.\n\n6. \u0093Immediate family member\u0094 follows the\nSEC\u0092s definition of such and covers spouses, parents, children, step-parents, step-children, siblings, in-\nlaws, and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of any director,\nnominee for director, executive officer, or significant shareholder of the company.\n\n7. Professional services can be characterized as\nadvisory in nature, generally involve access to sensitive company information or to strategic decision-\nmaking, and typically have a commission- or fee-based payment structure. Professional services generally\ninclude but are not limited to the following: investment banking/financial advisory services, commercial\nbanking (beyond deposit services), investment services, insurance services, accounting/audit services,\nconsulting services, marketing services,\nlegal services, property management services, realtor services, lobbying services, executive search\nservices, and IT consulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional\nrelationships and not professional services: deposit\nservices, IT tech support services, educational services, and construction services. The case of\nparticipation in a banking syndicate by a non-lead bank should be considered a transactional (and hence\nsubject\nto the associated materiality test) rather than a professional relationship. \u0093Of Counsel\u0094 relationships are\nonly considered immaterial if the individual does not receive any form of compensation (in excess of $10,000\nper year) from, or is\na retired partner of, the firm providing the professional service. The case of a company providing a\nprofessional service to one of its directors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated,\nwill be considered a transactional\nrather than a professional relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be\nprofessional services unless the company explains why such services are not advisory.\n\n8. A material transactional relationship, including grants to non-profit organizations, exists if the\ncompany makes annual payments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity, exceeding the greater\nof: $200,000 or 5 percent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues, for a company that follows NASDAQ listing\nstandards; or the greater of\n$1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues, for a company that follows NYSE listing\nstandards. For a company that follows neither of the preceding standards, ISS will apply the NASDAQ-based\nmateriality test. (The recipient\nis the party receiving the financial proceeds from the transaction).\n\n9. Dissident directors who are parties to a voting agreement pursuant\nto a settlement or similar arrangement may be classified as Independent Directors if an analysis of the\nfollowing factors indicates that the voting agreement does not compromise their alignment with all\nshareholders\u0092 interests: the terms of the\nagreement; the duration of the standstill provision in the agreement; the limitations and requirements of\nactions that are agreed upon; if the dissident director nominee(s) is subject to the standstill; and if\nthere any conflicting relationships or\nrelated party transactions.\n\n10. Interlocks include: executive officers serving as directors on each other\u0092s compensation or similar\ncommittees (or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board); or executive officers sitting on each\nother\u0092s boards and at least one serves on the other\u0092s compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence\nof such a committee, on\nthe board).\n\n11. The operating involvement of the founder with the company will be considered; if the founder was never\nemployed by the company, ISS may deem him or her an Independent Director.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

For purposes of ISS\u0092s director independence classification, \u0093material\u0094 will be defined as a standard of\nrelationship (financial, personal, or otherwise) that a reasonable person might conclude could potentially\ninfluence one\u0092s objectivity in the boardroom in a manner that would have a meaningful impact on an\nindividual\u0092s ability to satisfy\nrequisite fiduciary standards on behalf of shareholders.\n\nComposition\n\nAttendance at Board and Committee Meetings:Generally vote against or withhold from directors (except\nnominees who served only part of the fiscal year 3) who attend less than 75 percent of the aggregate of\ntheir board and committee meetings for the period for which they served, unless an acceptable reason for\nabsences is disclosed in the proxy or another SEC filing. Acceptable reasons for director absences are\ngenerally limited to the following:\n                                \n  \u00a7    Medical issues/illness;  \n                                \n                                \n  \u00a7    Family emergencies; and  \n                                \n                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Missing only one meeting (when the total of all meetings is three or fewer).  \n                                                                                     \nIn cases of chronic poor attendance without reasonable justification, in addition to voting against the\ndirector(s) with poor attendance, generally vote against or\nwithhold from appropriate members of the nominating/governance committees or the full board.\n\nIf the proxy disclosure is unclear and insufficient to determine\nwhether a director attended at least 75 percent of the aggregate of his/her board and committee meetings\nduring his/her period of service, vote against or withhold from the director(s) in question.\n\nOverboarded Directors:Generally vote against or withhold from individual directors who:\n                                                        \n  \u00a7    Sit on more than five public company boards; or  \n                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n       Are CEOs of public companies who sit on the boards of more than two public companies besides their   \n  \u00a7    own\u0097withhold only                                                                                     \n       at their outside boards4.                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nGender Diversity :Generally vote against or withhold from the chair of the nominating committee (or other\ndirectors on a case-by-casebasis) at companies where there are no women on the company\u0092s board. An exception\nwill be made if there was at least one woman on the board at the preceding annual meeting and the board\nmakes a firm commitment to return to a gender-diverse status within a year.\n\nRacial and/or Ethnic Diversity :For companies in the Russell 3000 or S&P 1500 indices, generally vote\nagainst or withhold from the chair of the nominating committee (or other directors on a case-by-casebasis)\nwhere the board has no apparent racially or ethnically diverse members 5.

Shareholder Rights & Defenses\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals/Nominations\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon advance notice proposals, giving support to those proposals which\nallow shareholders to submit proposals/nominations as close to the meeting date as reasonably possible and\nwithin the broadest window possible, recognizing the need to allow sufficient notice for company,\nregulatory, and shareholder review.\n\nTo be reasonable, the company\u0092s\ndeadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/nominations must be no earlier than 120 days prior to the\nanniversary of the previous year\u0092s meeting and have a submittal window of no shorter than 30 days from the\nbeginning of the notice period\n(also known as a 90-120-day window). The submittal window is the period under which shareholders must file\ntheir proposals/nominations prior to the deadline.\n\nIn general, support additional efforts by companies to ensure full disclosure in regard to a proponent\u0092s\neconomic and voting position in the company so long as\nthe informational requirements are reasonable and aimed at providing shareholders with the necessary\ninformation to review such proposals.\n\nAmend Bylaws without Shareholder Consent\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote against proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws.\n\nVote case-by-case on proposals\ngiving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition to shareholders, taking into account the\nfollowing:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Any impediments to shareholders\u0092 ability to amend the bylaws (i.e. supermajority voting               \n       requirements);                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                        \n  \u00a7    The company\u0092s ownership structure and historical voting turnout;  \n                                                                        \n                                                                          \n  \u00a7    Whether the board could amend bylaws adopted by shareholders; and  \n                                                                          \n                                                                                                \n  \u00a7    Whether shareholders would retain the ability to ratify any board-initiated amendments.  \n                                                                                                \nControl Share Acquisition Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing so\nwould enable the completion of a takeover that would be detrimental to shareholders.\n\nVote against proposals to\namend the charter to include control share acquisition provisions.\n\nVote for proposals to restore voting rights to the control shares.\n\nControl share acquisition statutes function by denying shares their voting rights when they contribute to\nownership in excess of certain thresholds. Voting rights for\nthose shares exceeding ownership limits may only be restored by approval of either a majority or\nsupermajority of disinterested shares. Thus, control share acquisition statutes effectively require a\nhostile bidder to put its offer to a shareholder\nvote or risk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder continues buying up a large block of shares.\n\nControl Share Cash-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share cash-outstatutes.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

In other words, when an investor crosses a preset threshold level, remaining shareholders are\ngiven the right to sell their shares to the acquirer, who must buy them at the highest acquiring price.\n\nDisgorgement Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state disgorgement provisions.\n\nDisgorgement provisions require an acquirer or potential acquirer of more than a certain percentage of a\ncompany\u0092s stock to\ndisgorge, or pay back, to the company any profits realized from the sale of that company\u0092s stock purchased\n24 months before achieving control status. All sales of company stock by the acquirer occurring within a\ncertain period of time (between\n18 months and 24 months) prior to the investor\u0092s gaining control status are subject to these recapture-of-\nprofits provisions.\n\nFair Price Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon proposals to adopt fair price provisions (provisions that\nstipulate that an acquirer must pay the same price to acquire all shares as it paid to acquire the control\nshares), evaluating factors such as the vote required to approve the proposed acquisition, the vote required\nto repeal the fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair price.\n\nGenerally vote against fair price provisions with shareholder vote requirements greater than a majority of\ndisinterested shares.\n\nFreeze-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state freeze-outprovisions. Freeze-outprovisions\nforce an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a company to wait a specified period of\ntime before gaining control of the company.\n\nGreenmail\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments or otherwise\nrestrict a company\u0092s ability to make greenmail payments.\n\nVote case-by-case on anti-greenmail proposals when they are bundled with other charter or bylaw amendments.\n\nGreenmail\npayments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock from individuals or groups seeking\ncontrol of the company. Since only the hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial premium over\nthe market value of its shares,\nthe practice discriminates against all other shareholders.\n\nShareholder Litigation Rights\n\nFederal Forum Selection Provisions\n\nFederal forum selection provisions require that U.S. federal courts be the sole forum for shareholders to\nlitigate claims arising under federal securities law.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

unilateral adoption (without a shareholder\nvote) of such a provision will generally be considered a one-time failure under the policy.\n\nExclusive Forum Provisions for State Law Matters\n\nExclusive forum provisions in the charter or bylaws restrict shareholders\u0092 ability to bring derivative\nlawsuits against the company, for claims arising out of\nstate corporate law, to the courts of a particular state (generally the state of incorporation).\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for charter or bylaw provisions that specify courts located within the\nstate of Delaware as the exclusive forum for corporate law matters for Delaware corporations, in the absence\nof serious concerns about corporate governance or board responsiveness to shareholders.\n\nFor states other than Delaware, vote case-by-case on exclusive forum provisions, taking into consideration:\n                                                                     \n  \u00a7    The company\u0092s stated rationale for adopting such a provision;

As the result of potential conflicts, the directors and        \n       officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a merger than if they did not hold     \n       these interests.                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    Consider whether these interests may have influenced these directors and officers to support or      \n       recommend the merger.

SVT is expressed as both a\ndollar amount and as a percentage of\nmarket value, and includes the new shares proposed, shares available under existing plans, and shares\ngranted but unexercised (using two measures, in the case of plans\n\n21 Proposals evaluated under the EPSC policy generally include those to approve or amend (1) stock option\nplans for employees and/or employees and directors, (2) restricted\nstock plans for employees and/or employees and directors, and (3) omnibus stock incentive plans for\nemployees and/or employees and directors; amended plans will be further evaluated case-by-case.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

All award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are placed on the most expensive\ntypes of awards (for example, full-value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be granted will\nbe the most expensive types.\n\nFor proposals that are not subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value Transfer is\nreasonable if it falls below a company-specific benchmark.\nThe benchmark is determined as follows: The top quartile performers in each industry group (using the Global\nIndustry Classification Standard: GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are\nestablished based on these top\nperformers\u0092 historic SVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most\nstrongly correlated to SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the\nspecific company by plugging\nthe company-specific performance measures, size, and cash compensation into the industry cap equations to\narrive at the company\u0092s\nbenchmark.22\n\nThree-Year Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\n\nA \u0093Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\u0094 is used for stock plan evaluations. Value-Adjusted Burn Rate benchmarks are\ncalculated as the greater of: (1) an\nindustry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the company\u0092s GICS group segmented by S&P\n500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&P 500) and non-Russell 3000 index; and (2) a\nde minimis threshold established separately for each of the S&P 500, the Russell 3000 index less the S&P\n500, and thenon-Russell 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-rate benchmark changes\nwill be limited to a predetermined range above or below the prior year\u0092s burn-rate benchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate is calculated as follows:\n\nValue-Adjusted Burn Rate = ((# of options * option\u0092s dollar value using a Black-Scholes model) + (# of full-\nvalue awards * stock price)) / (Weighted average\ncommon shares * stock price).\n\nEgregious Factors\n\nLiberal Change in Control Definition\n\nGenerally vote against equity plans if the plan has a liberal definition of change in control and the equity\nawards could vest upon such liberal definition of change\nin control, even though an actual change in control may not occur. Examples of such a definition include,\nbut are not limited to, announcement or commencement of a tender offer, provisions for acceleration upon a\n\u0093potential\u0094 takeover,\nshareholder approval of a merger or other transactions, or similar language.\n\nRepricing Provisions\n\nVote against plans that expressly permit the repricing or exchange of underwater stock options/stock\nappreciate rights (SARs) without prior\nshareholder approval. \u0093Repricing\u0094 typically includes the ability to do any of the following:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Amend the terms of outstanding options or SARs to reduce the exercise price of such outstanding      \n       options or SARs;                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Cancel outstanding options or SARs in exchange for options or SARs with an exercise price that is    \n  \u00a7    less than the exercise                                                                               \n       price of the original options or SARs;                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                   \n  \u00a7    Cancel underwater options in exchange for stock awards; or  \n                                                                   \n                                                    \n  \u00a7    Provide cash buyouts of underwater options.  \n                                                    \nWhile the above cover most types of repricing, ISS may view other provisions as akin to repricing depending\non the facts and circumstances.\n\n22 For plans evaluated under the Equity Plan Scorecard policy, the company\u0092s SVT benchmark is considered\nalong with other factors.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

The proposal should clearly articulate why the board is\nchoosing to conduct an exchange program at this point in time. Repricing underwater options after a recent\nprecipitous drop in the\ncompany\u0092s stock price demonstrates poor timing and warrants additional scrutiny. Also, consider the terms of\nthe surrendered options, such as the grant date, exercise price and vesting schedule. Grant dates of\nsurrendered options should be far\nenough back (two to three years) so as not to suggest that repricings are being done to take advantage of\nshort-term downward price movements. Similarly, the exercise price of surrendered options should be above\nthe\n52-week high for the stock price.\n\nVote for shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.\n\nStock Plans in Lieu of Cash\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon plans that provide participants with the option of taking all or\na portion of their cash compensation in the form of stock.\n\nVote for non-employee director-only equity plans that provide a dollar-for-dollar cash-for-stock exchange.\n\nVote case-by-case on plans which do not provide a dollar-for-dollar cash for stock exchange. In cases where\nthe exchange is not dollar-for-dollar, the request for new or\nadditional shares for such equity program will be considered using the binomial option pricing model. In an\neffort to capture the total cost of total compensation, ISS will not make any adjustments to carve out the\nin-lieu-of cash compensation.\n\nTransfer Stock Option (TSO) Programs\n\nGeneral Recommendation:One-timeTransfers: Vote against or withhold from compensation committee members if\nthey fail to submit one-timetransfers to shareholders for approval.\n                                                                \n  W W W .

Further, premium-priced options should have a          \n       meaningful premium to be considered performance-based                                                \n       awards.                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Second, assess the rigor of the company\u0092s performance-based equity program. If the bar set for the    \n       performance-based                                                                                    \n       program is too low based on the company\u0092s historical or peer group comparison, generally vote for     \n  \u00a7    the proposal. Furthermore, if target performance results in an above target payout, vote for the     \n       shareholder proposal due to program\u0092s poor                                                            \n       design. If the company does not disclose the performance metric of the performance-based equity      \n       program, vote for the shareholder proposal regardless of the outcome of the first step to the test.  \n                                                                                                            \nIn general, vote for the shareholder proposal if the company does not meet both of the above two steps.\n\nPay for Superior Performance\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon shareholder proposals that request the board establish a pay-for-\nsuperiorperformance standard in the company\u0092s executive compensation plan for senior executives.

Many companies have adopted policies that permit recoupment in cases where\nan executive\u0092s fraud, misconduct, or negligence significantly contributed to a restatement of financial\nresults that led to the awarding of unearned incentive compensation. However, such policies may be narrow\ngiven that not all misconduct or negligence may result in significant financial restatements. Misconduct,\nnegligence, or lack of sufficient oversight by senior executives may lead to significant financial loss or\nreputational damage that may have long-lasting impact.\n\nIn considering whether to support such shareholder proposals, ISS will take into consideration the following\nfactors:\n                                                               \n  \u00a7    If the company has adopted a formal recoupment policy;  \n                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n       The rigor of the recoupment policy focusing on how and under what circumstances the company may      \n  \u00a7    recoup incentive or stock                                                                            \n       compensation;                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Whether the company has chronic restatement history or material financial problems;  \n                                                                                            \n                                                                                                  \n  \u00a7    Whether the company\u0092s policy substantially addresses the concerns raised by the proponent;  \n                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    Disclosure of recoupment of incentive or stock compensation from senior executives or lack thereof;  \n       or                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                    \n  \u00a7    Any other relevant factors.  \n                                    \nSeverance Agreements for Executives/Golden Parachutes\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for shareholder proposals requiring that golden parachutes or executive\nseverance agreements be submitted for shareholder ratification, unless the proposal requires shareholder\napproval priorto entering into employment contracts.\n\nVote case-by-case on proposals to ratify or cancel golden parachutes.

Social and Environmental Issues\n\nGlobal Approach \u0096 E&S Shareholder Proposals\n\nISS applies a common approach globally to evaluating social and environmental proposals which cover a wide\nrange of topics, including consumer and product safety,\nenvironment and energy, labor standards and human rights, workplace and board diversity, and corporate\npolitical issues. While a variety of factors goes into each analysis, the overall principle guiding all vote\nrecommendations focuses on how the\nproposal may enhance or protect shareholder value in either the short or long term.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote case-by-case,examining primarily whether implementation of the\nproposal is likely to enhance or protect shareholder value. The following factors will be considered:\n                                                                                                            \n       If the issues presented in the proposal are being appropriately or effectively dealt with through    \n  \u00a7    legislation or                                                                                       \n       government regulation;                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u00a7    If the company has already responded in an appropriate and sufficient manner to the issue(s) raised  \n       in the proposal;                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                        \n  \u00a7    Whether the proposal\u0092s request is unduly burdensome (scope or timeframe) or overly prescriptive;  \n                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n       The company\u0092s approach compared with any industry standard practices for addressing the issue(s)      \n  \u00a7    raised by the                                                                                        \n       proposal;                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Whether there are significant controversies, fines, penalties, or litigation associated with the     \n  \u00a7    company\u0092s practices                                                                                   \n       related to the issue(s) raised in the proposal;                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       If the proposal requests increased disclosure or greater transparency, whether reasonable and        \n  \u00a7    sufficient information is                                                                            \n       currently available to shareholders from the company or from other publicly available sources; and   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       If the proposal requests increased disclosure or greater transparency, whether implementation would  \n  \u00a7    reveal proprietary or                                                                                \n       confidential information that could place the company at a competitive disadvantage.                 \n                                                                                                            \nEndorsement of Principles\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote against proposals seeking a company\u0092s endorsement of principles that\nsupport a particular public policy position. Endorsing a set of principles may require a company to take a\nstand on an issue that is beyond its own control and may limit its flexibility with respect to future\ndevelopments.\n\nManagement and the board should be afforded the flexibility to make decisions on specific public policy\npositions based on their own\nassessment of the most beneficial strategies for the company.\n\nAnimal Welfare\n\nAnimal Welfare Policies\n\nGeneral Recommendation: Generally vote for proposals seeking a report on a company\u0092s animal\nwelfare standards, or animal welfare-related risks, unless:\n                                                                                                     \n  \u00a7    The company has already published a set of animal welfare standards and monitors compliance;  \n                                                                                                     \n                                                                     \n  \u00a7    The company\u0092s standards are comparable to industry peers; and  \n                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n       There are no recent significant fines, litigation, or controversies related to the company\u0092s and/or   \n  \u00a7    its                                                                                                  \n       suppliers\u0092 treatment of animals.                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n  W W W .
