  "text": "SPDR \u00aeSeries Trust\n\nSPDR S&P \u00ae500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF\n\n(the \u0093Fund\u0094)\n\nSupplement dated June 26, 2020 to the\nProspectus\n\ndated October 31, 2019, as may be supplemented\nfrom time to time\n\nEffective immediately, the third and fourth\nparagraphs in \u0093THE FUND\u0092S PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT\n\nSTRATEGY\u0094 section beginning on page 36 are\ndeleted and replaced with the following:\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of companies in the S&P 500 Index\nthat are \u0093fossil fuel free\u0094, which are\ndefined as companies that do not own fossil\nfuel reserves (either proven or probable). For\npurposes of the composition of the Index,\nfossil fuel reserves are defined as (i)\nthermal coal reserves, (ii) other\nnon-metallurgical coal reserves (e.g., coal\nfor chemical biproducts, coal briquettes,\nresidential use, liquid fuel, cement\nproduction, paper manufacturing,\npharmaceutical, alumina refineries,\nferrochrome, anthracite) (iii) conventional or\nunconventional oil reserves (e.g., natural gas\nliquids, oil sands, condensates and liquid\npetroleum gas), (iv) natural gas reserves, (v)\nshale gas reserves, and (vi) oil and gas\nreserves that have not been disclosed\ntransparently as specific types of oil or gas,\nor are disclosed as one aggregate quantity of\noil and gas reserves combined. The Index is a\nsubset of the S&P 500 Index (the \u0093Underlying\nIndex\u0094),\nwhich serves as the initial universe of\neligible securities for the Index. The\nUnderlying Index focuses on the large\ncapitalization U.S. equity market, including\ncommon stock and real estate investment trusts\n(\u0093REITs\u0094). The selection\nuniverse for the S&P 500 Index includes all\nU.S.-domiciled, as determined by S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC, common equities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ Select Market, Investors\nExchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX with market\ncapitalizations of $8.2 billion or more at the\ntime of inclusion. The minimum required\ncapitalization may be revised by the Index\nProvider (as defined below)\nat any time. In constructing the Index, the\ninitial universe is screened in an effort to\nexclude companies with any ownership of fossil\nfuel reserves, including for third-party and\nin-house power generation,\nas determined by publicly available\ninformation, such as annual reports and other\ncompany publications.\n\nThe Index is weighted by\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization. The\nIndex is rebalanced quarterly after the close\nof business on the third Friday of March,\nJune, September, and December. The rebalancing\nreference dates are after the close of the\nthird Friday of February,\nMay, August, and November, respectively. New\nadditions to the Underlying Index are reviewed\nfor inclusion in the Index each quarter,\nprovided they have been added to the\nUnderlying Index by the Index rebalancing\nreference dates. Fossil fuel reserve\nownership information is updated as part of\neach quarterly rebalancing. As of June 22,\n2020, a significant portion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in the technology sector,\nalthough this may change from time to time. As\nof June 22, 2020,\nthe Index comprised 478 stocks.\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE\nREFERENCE\n\n06262020SUP1\n"
