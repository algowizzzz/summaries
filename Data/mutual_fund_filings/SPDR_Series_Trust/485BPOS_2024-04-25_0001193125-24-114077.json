You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions\nand other fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual\nFund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.30%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.30%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $31        $97    $169     $381  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities\n(or \u201c turns over \u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not\nreflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. During the\nmost recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 52% of the average value of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal Investment Strategy In seeking to track the performance of the Bloomberg EM Local\nCurrency Government Diversified Index (the \u201c Index \u201d ), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all of the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund\nmay purchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return characteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will\nbe based on a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these factors,\nSSGA Funds Management, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ), the Fund's investment adviser, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the Index in approximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its objective. Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total\nassets in the securities comprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the economic characteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt securities that\nare not included in the Index, cash and cash equivalents or money market instruments, such as repurchase\nagreements and money market funds (including money market\n\n1\n\nfunds advised by the Adviser). In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a particular industry\nor group of industries. The Fund may also enter into forward currency exchange contracts for hedging and/or\ninvestment purposes. Swaps and futures contracts may be used by the Fund in seeking performance that\ncorresponds to its Index and in managing cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the performance of the\nfixed-rate local currency sovereign debt of emerging market countries. The Index includes government bonds\nissued by investment grade and non-investment grade countries outside the United States, in local\ncurrencies, that have a remaining maturity of one year or more and are rated B3/B-/B- or higher using the\nmiddle rating of Moody's Investors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Inc., respectively.\nEach of the component securities in the Index is a constituent of the Bloomberg EM Local Currency Government\nIndex. As of February 29, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund comprised companies located in Asia,\nalthough this may change from time to time. As of February 29, 2024, there were approximately 648 securities\nin the Index. The Index is calculated by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (as defined below) using a\nmodified \u201c market capitalization \u201d methodology. This design ensures that each constituent country within the\nIndex is represented in a proportion consistent with its percentage with respect to the total market\ncapitalization of the Index. Component securities in each constituent country are represented in a\nproportion consistent with their percentage relative to the other component securities in the constituent\ncountry. The securities in the Index are updated on the last business day of each month. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d ), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Index. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the Fund As with all investments, there are certain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund\nShares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is\nnot insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change substantially due to various factors including, but not limited to,\neconomic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt securities markets and adversely affect global economies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other events could have a significant impact on the\nFund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest\npayments, or illiquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially slower than originally anticipated and the value of\nthose securities may fall sharply. A rising interest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income markets. During periods when interest rates are at\nlow levels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially faster than originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid before\nexpected, the prepayments of principal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower\nrates. During periods of falling interest rates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will likely have a greater effect on the values of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities could trail the returns on other investment options, including\ninvestments in equity securities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic investments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial report standards comparable to those in the United States.\nFurther, such entities and/or their securities may be subject to risks associated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater market volatility; differing securities market structures;\nhigher transaction costs; and various administrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and 2 settling\nportfolio transactions or in receiving payment of dividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the exchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open,\nthere may be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for\nthe underlying security on the closed foreign market. These deviations could result in the Fund experiencing\npremiums or discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in domestic securities. Securities traded on\nforeign markets may be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded domestically. Foreign governments\nmay impose restrictions on the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to the extent that the Fund\nbuys securities denominated in a foreign currency, there are special risks such as changes in currency\nexchange rates and the risk that a foreign government could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited number of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the Fund. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks of investing in emerging\nmarkets include, among others, greater political and economic instability, greater volatility in currency\nexchange rates, less developed securities markets, possible trade barriers, currency transfer restrictions,\na more limited number of potential buyers and issuers, an emerging market country's dependence on revenue\nfrom particular commodities or international aid, less governmental supervision and regulation,\nunavailability of currency hedging techniques, differences in auditing and financial reporting standards,\nand less developed legal systems. There is also the potential for unfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The securities of emerging market companies may trade less\nfrequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial market\ncorrections may limit very significantly the liquidity of securities of certain companies in a particular\ncountry or geographic region, or of all companies in the country or region. The Fund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions in such securities at any time, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for investments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries.\nSovereign Debt Obligations Risk: Investments in debt securities issued by governments or by government\nagencies and instrumentalities involve the risk that the governmental entities responsible for repayment may\nbe unable or unwilling to pay interest and repay principal when due. Any restructuring of a sovereign debt\nobligation held by the Fund will likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of the obligation. In\nthe event of default of sovereign debt, the Fund may be unable to pursue legal action against the sovereign\nissuer or to realize on collateral securing the debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset value per share (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in times of market volatility or periods of steep market declines. Below Investment-Grade\nSecurities Risk: Lower-quality debt securities ( \u201c high yield \u201d or \u201c junk \u201d bonds) are considered\npredominantly speculative, and can involve a substantially greater risk of default than higher quality debt\nsecurities. Issuers of lower-quality debt securities may have substantially greater risk of insolvency or\nbankruptcy than issuers of higher-quality debt securities. They can be illiquid, and their values can have\nsignificant volatility and may decline significantly over short periods of time. Lower-quality debt\nsecurities tend to be more sensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or the market or economy in general.\nCurrency Risk: The value of the Fund's assets may be affected favorably or unfavorably by currency exchange\nrates, currency exchange control regulations, and delays, restrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation\nof foreign currencies. Foreign currency exchange rates may have significant volatility, and changes in the\nvalues of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar may result in substantial declines in the values of the\nFund's assets denominated in foreign currencies. Forward Currency Contracts Risk: In a forward currency\ncontract, the Fund agrees to buy in the future an amount in one currency in return for another currency, at\nan exchange rate determined at the time the contract is entered into. If currency exchange rates have moved\nagainst the Fund's position at the time the contract is settled or closed, the Fund will lose money on the\ncontract. There is no limit on the extent to which exchange rates may move against the Fund's position. The\nmarkets for certain currencies may at times become illiquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter into new\nforward contracts or to close out existing contracts. Forward currency contracts are entered into in the\nover-the-counter market, and the Fund's ability to profit from a contract will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its obligations under the contract. 3 Futures Contract Risk: A\nfutures contract is a standardized agreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may have significant volatility. It is possible that a\nfutures contract transaction will result in a much greater loss than the principal amount invested, and the\nFund may not be able to close out the futures contract at a favorable time or price. There is no assurance\nthat a liquid secondary market on an exchange will exist for any particular futures contract. In the event\nno such market exists, it might not be possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable\nto terminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation between\nmovements in the prices of the futures contract and movements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Geographic Focus Risk: The performance of a fund that\ninvests significantly in one or more countries or geographic regions will be closely tied to market,\ncurrency, economic, political, environmental, or regulatory conditions and developments in the countries or\nregions in which the fund invests, and may be more volatile than the performance of a fund that does not\ninvest significantly in such countries or regions. Asia: Certain Asian economies have experienced high\ninflation, high unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Many\nAsian economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization, and there is no assurance that this\ngrowth rate will be maintained. Economic events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic\neffect on the entire Asian region, as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in\nthe Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in\nwhich the Fund invests. Many Asian countries are subject to political risk, including corruption and\nregional conflict with neighboring countries. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and\nlabor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments. Income Risk: The Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by the Fund may call or\nredeem the securities during periods of falling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be required to\nreinvest in securities paying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund\nmay have to reinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying income at lower rates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track\nthe performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of\nthe Index or of the actual securities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less\nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The structure and\ncomposition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently,\nthe performance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of companies that do not\nalign with the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to the component securities of\nthe Index and the Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. The\nFund may recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to reflect\nchanges in the securities included in the Index. The Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling securities. In addition, the Fund may not be fully invested at\ntimes, generally as a result of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to\nmeet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities not included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed\nmarket conditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's\nholdings deteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market price of Fund Shares and the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's 4\n\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid investments and/or the difficulty in\npurchasing and selling such investments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-Diversification Risk: As a \u201c non-diversified \u201d fund, the Fund may hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio securities than many other funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a decline in the market value of a particular security held by the Fund may affect its\nvalue more than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile\nthan the values of shares of more diversified funds. The Fund may become diversified for periods of time\nsolely as a result of tracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component securities).\nSwaps Risk: A swap is a two-party contract that generally obligates the parties to exchange payments based\non a specified reference security, basket of securities, security index or index component. Swaps can\ninvolve greater risks than direct investment in securities because swaps may be leveraged and are subject to\ncounterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit\nrisk and pricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It may not be possible for the Fund to\nliquidate a swap position at an advantageous time or price, which may result in significant losses.\nValuation Risk: Some portfolio holdings, potentially a large portion of the Fund's investment portfolio, may\nbe valued on the basis of factors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are not readily available. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in\ntime might differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using\nmarket quotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations,\nincluding \u201c fair valued \u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation\nestablished by the Fund at that time. Fund Performance The following bar chart and table provide an\nindication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for certain time periods compare with the average\nannual returns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based securities index. The Fund's past performance\n(before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information is available by calling 1-866-787-2257or visiting our website at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs .

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in\nlarge blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201c Creation Units. \u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in\nexchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market\nprices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), Fund Shares\nmay trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund\nShares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price\na buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept\nfor Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price,\npremiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Tax Information The\nFund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Some distributions may be\ntreated as a return of capital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information. 6\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond     \n  ETF (the\u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment         \n  resultsthat, before fees and expenses, correspond   \n  generally to the price and yield performance of an  \n  index thattracks the investment grade corporate     \n  sector of the global bond market outside of the     \n  United States.                                      \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund ( \u201c Fund Shares \u201d ). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions\nand other fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual\nFund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.50%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.50%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $51       $160    $280     $628  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities\n(or \u201c turns over \u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not\nreflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. During the\nmost recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 14% of the average value of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal Investment Strategy In seeking to track the performance of the Bloomberg Global\nAggregate ex-USD \u02c3$1B: Corporate Bond Index (the \u201c Index \u201d ), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which\nmeans that the Fund is not required to purchase all of the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities\nwith generally the same risk and return characteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ), the Fund's investment adviser,\neither may invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets\nin substantially all of the securities represented in the Index in approximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its objective. Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total\nassets in the securities comprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the economic characteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt securities that\nare not included in the Index, cash and cash equivalents or money market instruments, such as repurchase\nagreements and money market funds (including money market funds advised by SSGA Funds Management, Inc. ( \u201c\nSSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ), the investment adviser to the Fund). In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group of industries, but only to the\n\n7\n\nextent that the Index concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries. The Fund may also enter\ninto forward currency exchange contracts for hedging and/or investment purposes. Swaps and futures contracts\nmay be used by the Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to its Index and in managing cash flows. The\nIndex is designed to be a broad based measure of the global investment grade, fixed rate, fixed income\ncorporate markets outside the United States. The Index is part of the Bloomberg Global Aggregate ex-USD Bond\nIndex. The securities in the Index must have a $1 billion USD equivalent market capitalization outstanding\nand at least 1 year remaining. Securities must be fixed rate, although zero coupon bonds and step-ups are\npermitted. Additionally, securities must be rated investment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or better) using the\nmiddle rating from Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc., or S&P Global Ratings after\ndropping the highest and lowest available ratings. If only two agencies rate a security, then the more\nconservative (lower) rating will be used. If only one rating agency rates a security, then that one rating\nwill be used. Excluded from the Index are subordinated debt, convertible securities, floating-rate notes,\nfixed-rate perpetuals, warrants, inflation-linked bonds, and structured notes. The Index is market\ncapitalization weighted and the securities in the Index are updated on the last business day of each month.\nAs of February 29, 2024, there were approximately 962 securities in the Index. As of February 29, 2024, the\nfollowing countries were represented in the Index: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark,\nFinland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of February 29, 2024, a significant portion of the\nFund comprised companies located in Europe and the United States, although this may change from time to\ntime. As of February 29, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund comprised companies in the financial and\nindustrial sectors, although this may change from time to time. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d ), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index\nProvider determines the composition of the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the Index and\npublishes information regarding the market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value,\nand you could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Market Risk: The Fund's\ninvestments are subject to changes in general economic conditions, general market fluctuations and the risks\ninherent in investment in securities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and prices of investments\ncan change substantially due to various factors including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession,\nchanges in interest rates, inflation, changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities\nmarkets and adversely affect global economies and markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or other public\nhealth issues, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The values of debt securities may increase or decrease as a result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and increased volatility of the fixed\nincome markets. During periods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the\nFund may have a negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the extent that interest\nrates fall, certain underlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster than originally anticipated.\nIf the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of principal may have to\nbe reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest rates, the\nincome received by the Fund may decline. Changes in interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on investments in debt securities could trail the\nreturns on other investment options, including investments in equity securities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities are subject to political, regulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S.\nentity, and many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting, auditing, legal and financial report\nstandards comparable to those in the United States. Further, such entities and/or their securities may be\nsubject to risks associated with currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax policy; greater market\nvolatility; differing securities market structures; higher transaction costs; and various administrative\ndifficulties, such as delays in clearing and 8 settling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed\nwhen the exchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there may be deviations between the current\nprice of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security on the closed foreign\nmarket. These deviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts greater than those of\nETFs that invest in domestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets may be less liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities traded domestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions on the repatriation\nof capital to the U.S. In addition, to the extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in a foreign\ncurrency, there are special risks such as changes in currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign\ngovernment could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In addition, to the extent investments are made in\na limited number of countries, events in those countries will have a more significant impact on the Fund.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in\nthe secondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there may be times when\nthe market price of the shares is more than the net asset value per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is heightened in times of market volatility or periods of steep\nmarket declines. Currency Risk: The value of the Fund's assets may be affected favorably or unfavorably by\ncurrency exchange rates, currency exchange control regulations, and delays, restrictions or prohibitions on\nthe repatriation of foreign currencies. Foreign currency exchange rates may have significant volatility, and\nchanges in the values of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar may result in substantial declines in\nthe values of the Fund's assets denominated in foreign currencies. Financial Sector Risk: Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which may limit both the amounts and types of\nloans and other financial commitments they can make, the interest rates and fees they can charge, the scope\nof their activities, the prices they can charge and the amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability\nis largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when\ninterest rates change or due to increased competition. In addition, deterioration of the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets, including U.S. and international credit\nand interbank money markets generally, thereby affecting a wide range of financial institutions and markets.\nCertain events in the financial sector may cause an unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain financial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a dramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial declines in the valuations of their assets, take action to raise capital (such as the\nissuance of debt or equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated with investment activities can negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance companies may be subject to severe price competition. Adverse economic, business or\npolitical developments could adversely affect financial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly connected to the value of real estate. Forward\nCurrency Contracts Risk: In a forward currency contract, the Fund agrees to buy in the future an amount in\none currency in return for another currency, at an exchange rate determined at the time the contract is\nentered into. If currency exchange rates have moved against the Fund's position at the time the contract is\nsettled or closed, the Fund will lose money on the contract. There is no limit on the extent to which\nexchange rates may move against the Fund's position. The markets for certain currencies may at times become\nilliquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter into new forward contracts or to close out existing contracts.\nForward currency contracts are entered into in the over-the-counter market, and the Fund's ability to profit\nfrom a contract will depend on the willingness and ability of its counterparty to perform its obligations\nunder the contract. Futures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a specific price at a specific future time, or cash settlement of\nthe terms of the contract. Transactions in futures contracts can create investment leverage and may have\nsignificant volatility. It is possible that a futures contract transaction will result in a much greater\nloss than the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be able to close out the futures contract at a\nfavorable time or price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange will exist for\nany particular futures contract. In the event no such market exists, it might not be possible to effect\nclosing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures contract. There\nis also a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the futures 9 contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations.\nGeographic Focus Risk: The performance of a fund that invests significantly in one or more countries or\ngeographic regions will be closely tied to market, currency, economic, political, environmental, or\nregulatory conditions and developments in the countries or regions in which the fund invests, and may be\nmore volatile than the performance of a fund that does not invest significantly in such countries or\nregions. Europe: Developed and emerging market countries in Europe will be significantly affected by the\nfiscal and monetary controls of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union ( \u201c EU \u201d ). Changes in\nregulations on trade, decreasing imports or exports, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and recessions\namong European countries may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other European countries.\nIn addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. For example, on January\n31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and, after\na transition period, left the EU single market and customs union under the terms of a new trade agreement on\nDecember 31, 2020. The agreement governs the new relationship between the United Kingdom and EU with respect\nto trading goods and services, but critical aspects of the relationship remain unresolved and subject to\nfurther negotiation and agreement. The full scope and nature of the consequences of the exit are not at this\ntime known and are unlikely to be known for a significant period of time. It is also unknown whether the\nUnited Kingdom's exit will increase the likelihood of other countries also departing the EU. Any exits from\nthe EU, or the possibility of such exits, may have a significant impact on the United Kingdom, Europe, and\nglobal economies, which may result in increased volatility and illiquidity, new legal and regulatory\nuncertainties and potentially lower economic growth for such economies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments. In addition, a number of countries in Europe have\nsuffered terrorist attacks and additional attacks may occur in the future. Such attacks may cause\nuncertainty in financial markets and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund\nhas exposure. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to falling interest rates or other factors.\nIssuers of securities held by the Fund may call or redeem the securities during periods of falling interest\nrates, and the Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities paying lower interest rates. If an\nobligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the prepayment in other obligations\npaying income at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of\nthe current or projected performance of the Index or of the actual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result,\nthe Fund's performance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of\nthe Index and, consequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have\nan adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of\ncompanies that do not align with the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to the\ncomponent securities of the Index and the Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund\nand its shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the securities included in the Index. The Fund also may be\nrequired to distribute any such gains to its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of correlation\nwith the Index), the Fund's return may not match the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs costs in buying and selling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a result of cash flows into or out of\nthe Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track the\nIndex return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the Index, or in some securities not\nincluded in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return and that of\nthe Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial companies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector products and services in general. Government\nregulation, world events, exchange rates and economic conditions, technological developments and liabilities\nfor environmental damage and general civil liabilities will likewise affect the performance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace and defense companies, a 10 component of the industrial sector, can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant\nextent, on U.S. and foreign government demand for their products and services. Thus, the financial condition\nof, and investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by governmental defense\nspending policies which are typically under pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation securities, another component of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from changes in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements\nand insurance costs. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or price or at all.\nIlliquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be subject to\nwide fluctuations in market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead to\ndifferences between the market price of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result\nin the Fund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit the ability of the\nFund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to limitations on\ninvestments in any illiquid investments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such investments,\nmay be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain market or sector. Swaps Risk: A swap is\na two-party contract that generally obligates the parties to exchange payments based on a specified\nreference security, basket of securities, security index or index component. Swaps can involve greater risks\nthan direct investment in securities because swaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk\n(e.g., the risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing\nrisk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It may not be possible for the Fund to liquidate a swap\nposition at an advantageous time or price, which may result in significant losses. Unconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets within one or more economic sectors or\nindustries, which may change from time to time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the risk that events negatively affecting such sectors\nor industries could reduce returns, potentially causing the value of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Some portfolio holdings, potentially a large portion of the Fund's investment\nportfolio, may be valued on the basis of factors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a\nportfolio holding when market quotations are not readily available. The value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it\nhad been priced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than\nmarket quotations, including \u201c fair valued \u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day to the next than if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and\nit is possible that the Fund would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a\ndiscount to the valuation established by the Fund at that time. Fund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund's\nperformance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for certain time periods\ncompare with the average annual returns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based securities index. The\nFund's past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will\nperform in the future.Updated performance information is available by calling 1-866-787-2257or visiting our\nwebsite at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs .

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Richard\nDarby-Dowman, Paul Brown, Pavel Khimchuk and Peter Spano, who are part of State Street Global Advisors\nLimited ( \u201c SSGA LTD \u201d ), an affiliate of the Adviser, and provide portfolio management services through a\npersonnel-sharing arrangement between the Adviser and SSGA LTD. Richard Darby-Dowman is a Vice President and\na Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Team at SSGA LTD. He joined SSGA LTD in 2006. Paul\nBrown is a Vice President and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Team at SSGA\nLTD. He joined SSGA LTD in 2013. Pavel Khimchuk is an Assistant Vice President and a Portfolio Manager in\nthe Fixed Income Beta Solutions Team at SSGA LTD. He joined SSGA LTD in 2023. Peter Spano, CFA, is a\nManaging Director and the EMEA Head of the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Team at SSGA LTD. He joined SSGA LTD\nin 2007. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201c\nCreation Units. \u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a\ndesignated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and\nsold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other\nalternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market\nprices rather than at net asset value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase\nFund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201c bid-ask\nspread \u201d ). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected\nto be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-\nadvantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Some distributions may be treated as a return of capital for\ntax purposes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services\nrelated to\n\n12\n\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the\nbroker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask\nyour salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information. 13\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF  \n  (the\u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment             \n  resultsthat, before fees and expenses, correspond   \n  generally to the price and yield performance of an  \n  index thattracks the fixed-rate local currency      \n  sovereign debt of investment grade countries        \n  outside the United States.                          \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund ( \u201c Fund Shares \u201d ). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions\nand other fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual\nFund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities\n(or \u201c turns over \u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not\nreflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. During the\nmost recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 20% of the average value of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal Investment Strategy In seeking to track the performance of the Bloomberg Global\nTreasury ex-US Capped Index (the \u201c Index \u201d ), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the\nFund is not required to purchase all of the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return characteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will\nbe based on a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these factors,\nSSGA Funds Management, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the Index in approximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its objective. Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total\nassets in the securities comprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the economic characteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt securities that\nare not included in the Index, cash and cash equivalents or money market instruments, such as repurchase\nagreements and money market funds (including money market funds advised by the Adviser). The Fund may also\nenter into forward currency exchange contracts for hedging and/or investment purposes. Futures contracts may\nbe used by the Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to its Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n14\n\nThe Index is designed to track the fixed-rate local currency sovereign debt of investment grade countries\noutside the United States. The Index includes government bonds issued by investment grade countries outside\nthe United States, in local currencies, that have a remaining maturity of one year or more and are rated\ninvestment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or higher using the middle rating of Moody's Investors Service, Inc., S&P\nGlobal Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Inc., respectively). Securities included in the Index may include\nsecurities that are subject to restrictions on resale under the U.S. federal securities laws ( \u201c restricted\nsecurities \u201d ). Each of the component securities in the Index is a constituent of the Bloomberg Global\nTreasury ex-US Index. In addition, the securities in the Index must be fixed-rate and have certain minimum\namounts outstanding, depending upon the currency in which the bonds are denominated. The Index is calculated\nby Bloomberg Index Services Limited using a modified \u201c market capitalization \u201d methodology. This design\nensures that each constituent country within the Index is represented in a proportion consistent with its\npercentage with respect to the total market capitalization of the Index. Component securities in each\nconstituent country are represented in a proportion consistent with their percentage relative to the other\ncomponent securities in the constituent country. The securities in the Index are updated on the last\nbusiness day of each month. As of February 29, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund comprised companies\nlocated in Europe and Japan, although this may change from time to time. As of February 29, 2024, there were\napproximately 1,604 securities in the Index. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the\n\u201c Index Provider \u201d ), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition of the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the Index and publishes information\nregarding the market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all investments,\nthere are certain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose money\nby investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and prices of investments can change substantially\ndue to various factors including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest\nrates, inflation, changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and general market\nliquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and\nadversely affect global economies and markets. Local, regional or global events such as war, military\nconflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments. Debt Securities\nRisk: The values of debt securities may increase or decrease as a result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and increased volatility of the fixed\nincome markets. During periods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the\nFund may have a negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the extent that interest\nrates fall, certain underlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster than originally anticipated.\nIf the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of principal may have to\nbe reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest rates, the\nincome received by the Fund may decline. Changes in interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on investments in debt securities could trail the\nreturns on other investment options, including investments in equity securities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities are subject to political, regulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S.\nentity, and many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting, auditing, legal and financial report\nstandards comparable to those in the United States. Further, such entities and/or their securities may be\nsubject to risks associated with currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax policy; greater market\nvolatility; differing securities market structures; higher transaction costs; and various administrative\ndifficulties, such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed\nwhen the exchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there may be deviations between the current\nprice of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security on the closed foreign\nmarket. These deviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts greater than those of\nETFs that invest in domestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets 15 may be less liquid (harder\nto sell) than securities traded domestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to the extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in\na foreign currency, there are special risks such as changes in currency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In addition, to the extent investments are\nmade in a limited number of countries, events in those countries will have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Sovereign Debt Obligations Risk: Investments in debt securities issued by governments or by government\nagencies and instrumentalities involve the risk that the governmental entities responsible for repayment may\nbe unable or unwilling to pay interest and repay principal when due. Any restructuring of a sovereign debt\nobligation held by the Fund will likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of the obligation. In\nthe event of default of sovereign debt, the Fund may be unable to pursue legal action against the sovereign\nissuer or to realize on collateral securing the debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset value per share (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in times of market volatility or periods of steep market declines. Currency Risk: The\nvalue of the Fund's assets may be affected favorably or unfavorably by currency exchange rates, currency\nexchange control regulations, and delays, restrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates may have significant volatility, and changes in the values of\nforeign currencies against the U.S. dollar may result in substantial declines in the values of the Fund's\nassets denominated in foreign currencies. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks of investing in emerging markets\ninclude, among others, greater political and economic instability, greater volatility in currency exchange\nrates, less developed securities markets, possible trade barriers, currency transfer restrictions, a more\nlimited number of potential buyers and issuers, an emerging market country's dependence on revenue from\nparticular commodities or international aid, less governmental supervision and regulation, unavailability of\ncurrency hedging techniques, differences in auditing and financial reporting standards, and less developed\nlegal systems. There is also the potential for unfavorable action such as expropriation, nationalization,\nembargo, and acts of war. The securities of emerging market companies may trade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial market corrections may\nlimit very significantly the liquidity of securities of certain companies in a particular country or\ngeographic region, or of all companies in the country or region. The Fund may be unable to liquidate its\npositions in such securities at any time, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's obligations.\nThese risks are generally greater for investments in frontier market countries, which typically have smaller\neconomies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries. Forward Currency\nContracts Risk: In a forward currency contract, the Fund agrees to buy in the future an amount in one\ncurrency in return for another currency, at an exchange rate determined at the time the contract is entered\ninto. If currency exchange rates have moved against the Fund's position at the time the contract is settled\nor closed, the Fund will lose money on the contract. There is no limit on the extent to which exchange rates\nmay move against the Fund's position. The markets for certain currencies may at times become illiquid, and\nthe Fund may be unable to enter into new forward contracts or to close out existing contracts. Forward\ncurrency contracts are entered into in the over-the-counter market, and the Fund's ability to profit from a\ncontract will depend on the willingness and ability of its counterparty to perform its obligations under the\ncontract. Futures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that calls for the purchase\nor sale of a specific asset at a specific price at a specific future time, or cash settlement of the terms\nof the contract. Transactions in futures contracts can create investment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures contract transaction will result in a much greater loss than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may not be able to close out the futures contract at a favorable\ntime or price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange will exist for any\nparticular futures contract. In the event no such market exists, it might not be possible to effect closing\ntransactions, and the Fund will be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is also a\nrisk of imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a futures contract may be unable or unwilling to make\ntimely settlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. 16 Geographic\nFocus Risk: The performance of a fund that invests significantly in one or more countries or geographic\nregions will be closely tied to market, currency, economic, political, environmental, or regulatory\nconditions and developments in the countries or regions in which the fund invests, and may be more volatile\nthan the performance of a fund that does not invest significantly in such countries or regions. Europe:\nDeveloped and emerging market countries in Europe will be significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary\ncontrols of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union ( \u201c EU \u201d ). Changes in regulations on\ntrade, decreasing imports or exports, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and recessions among European\ncountries may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other European countries. In addition,\none or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. For example, on January 31, 2020,\nthe United Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and, after a\ntransition period, left the EU single market and customs union under the terms of a new trade agreement on\nDecember 31, 2020. The agreement governs the new relationship between the United Kingdom and EU with respect\nto trading goods and services, but critical aspects of the relationship remain unresolved and subject to\nfurther negotiation and agreement. The full scope and nature of the consequences of the exit are not at this\ntime known and are unlikely to be known for a significant period of time. It is also unknown whether the\nUnited Kingdom's exit will increase the likelihood of other countries also departing the EU. Any exits from\nthe EU, or the possibility of such exits, may have a significant impact on the United Kingdom, Europe, and\nglobal economies, which may result in increased volatility and illiquidity, new legal and regulatory\nuncertainties and potentially lower economic growth for such economies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments. In addition, a number of countries in Europe have\nsuffered terrorist attacks and additional attacks may occur in the future. Such attacks may cause\nuncertainty in financial markets and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund\nhas exposure. Japan: The growth of Japan's economy has historically lagged that of its Asian neighbors and\nother major developed economies. The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has\nbeen adversely affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies\nand the economic conditions of its trading partners. China has become an important trading partner with\nJapan, yet the countries' political relationship has become strained. Should political tension increase, it\ncould adversely affect the economy, especially the export sector, and destabilize the region as a whole.\nJapan also remains heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a\nnegative impact on the economy. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its\nvalue may cause a decline in exports that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has, in the past,\nintervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain or reduce the value of the yen. Japanese\nintervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably\nand could cause losses to investors. Japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a significant\npopulation decline in recent years. Japan's labor market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural\nchanges, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to meet the need for\nincreased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan's economic competitiveness. Natural disasters,\nsuch as earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons or tsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Japanese economy and, in turn, the Fund. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline\ndue to falling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by the Fund may call or redeem\nthe securities during periods of falling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be required to reinvest\nin securities paying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying income at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track the performance\nof an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less favorable than that\nof a portfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The structure and composition of the Index will\naffect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include, and the\nFund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to the component securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and its 17 shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains\nas a result of rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains to its shareholders to\navoid adverse federal income tax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Index\n( i.e. , achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), the Fund's return may not match the return of\nthe Index. The Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs costs in\nbuying and selling securities. In addition, the Fund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the Index,\nor in some securities not included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of divergence between the\nFund's return and that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or price\nor at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may\nlead to differences between the market price of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the Fund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit the\nability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain market or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk: As a \u201c non-diversified \u201d fund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of portfolio\nsecurities than many other funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a\ndecline in the market value of a particular security held by the Fund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may become diversified for periods of time solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component securities). Restricted Securities\nRisk: The Fund may hold securities that have not been registered for sale to the public under the U.S.\nfederal securities laws. There can be no assurance that a trading market will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Limitations on the resale of these securities may have an adverse effect on\ntheir marketability, and may prevent the Fund from disposing of them promptly at reasonable prices. The Fund\nmay have to bear the expense of registering the securities for resale and the risk of substantial delays in\neffecting the registration. Also, restricted securities may be difficult to value because market quotations\nmay not be readily available, and the securities may have significant volatility. Valuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings, potentially a large portion of the Fund's investment portfolio, may be valued on the\nbasis of factors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market turmoil or\nreduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including \u201c\nfair valued \u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next\nthan if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close\nout a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation\nestablished by the Fund at that time. 18\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide an indication of the risks of investing in the\nFund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's average\nannual returns for certain time periods compare with the average annual returns of the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based securities index. The Fund's past performance (before and after taxes) is not\nnecessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.Updated performance information is\navailable by calling 1-866-787-2257or visiting our website at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Annual Total\nReturns (years ended 12/31) Highest Quarterly Return: 9.90% ( Q4, 2023)\nLowest Quarterly Return:- 11.57% ( Q2, 2022)\n\nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods ended 12/31/23) The after-tax returns presented in the table below\nare calculated using highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the\nimpact of state and local taxes. Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                                                                    \n                                                      OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                                 5.73%    -2.18%     -1.23%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 5.00%    -2.64%     -1.58%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     3.37%    -1.81%     -1.04%    \n  Fund Shares                                                                       \n  Bloomberg Global Treasury ex-US Capped Index                                      \n  (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or        6.25%    -1.81%     -0.78%    \n  taxes)                                                                            \n  Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index (reflects no  5.72%    -0.32%     0.38%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                            \n                                                                                    \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are James Kramer,\nJoanna Madden and Cynthia Moy. James Kramer is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 1996. Joanna Madden is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2003. Cynthia Moy is a Principal of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in 2007. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers)\nonly in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201c Creation Units. \u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in\nexchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market\nprices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), Fund Shares\nmay trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund\nShares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price\na buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept\nfor Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price,\npremiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs .\n\n19\n\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual\nretirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Some\ndistributions may be treated as a return of capital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other\nFinancial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your\nsalesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 20\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury Bond ETF\n                                                   \n  Investment Objective                             \n  The SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International      \n  Treasury Bond ETF (the\u201cFund\u201d) seeks to           \n  provideinvestment results that, before fees and  \n  expenses, correspond generally to the price and  \n  yield performanceof an index that tracks the     \n  short-term (1-3 year remaining maturity) fixed   \n  rate, investment grade debt issuedby foreign     \n  governments of investment grade countries.       \n                                                   \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund ( \u201c Fund Shares \u201d ). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions\nand other fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual\nFund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses1                        0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses1  0.35%  \n                                                \n1 The Fund's \u201cOther expenses\u201d and \u201cTotal annual Fund operating expenses\u201d have been restated to reflect\ncurrent fees.Amounts do not reflect non-recurring expenses incurred during the prior fiscal year. Example:\nThis Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in\nother funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. Although your\nactual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities\n(or \u201c turns over \u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not\nreflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. During the\nmost recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 51% of the average value of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal Investment Strategy In seeking to track the performance of the Bloomberg 1-3 Year\nGlobal Treasury ex-US Capped Index (the \u201c Index \u201d ), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means that\nthe Fund is not required to purchase all of the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return characteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will\nbe based on a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these factors,\nSSGA Funds Management, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the Index in approximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its objective. Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total\nassets in the securities comprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the economic characteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt securities that\nare not included in the Index, cash and cash equivalents\n\n21\n\nor money market instruments, such as repurchase agreements and money market funds (including money market\nfunds advised by the Adviser). The Fund may also enter into forward currency exchange contracts for hedging\nand/or investment purposes. Futures contracts may be used by the Fund in seeking performance that\ncorresponds to its Index and in managing cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the performance of\nfixed-rate local currency sovereign debt of investment grade countries outside the United States that have\nremaining maturities of one to three years. The Index includes government bonds issued by investment grade\ncountries outside the United States, in local currencies, that have remaining maturities of one to three\nyears and are rated investment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or higher using the middle rating of Moody's Investors\nService, Inc., S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Inc., respectively). Securities included in the Index\nmay include securities that are subject to restrictions on resale under the U.S. federal securities laws ( \u201c\nrestricted securities \u201d ). Each of the component securities in the Index is a constituent of the Bloomberg\nGlobal Treasury ex-US Index. In addition, the securities in the Index must be fixed-rate and have certain\nminimum amounts outstanding, depending upon the currency in which the bonds are denominated. The Index is\ncalculated by Bloomberg Index Services Limited using a modified \u201c market capitalization \u201d methodology. This\ndesign ensures that each constituent country within the Index is represented in a proportion consistent with\nits percentage with respect to the total market capitalization of the Index. Component securities in each\nconstituent country are represented in a proportion consistent with their percentage relative to the other\ncomponent securities in the constituent country. The securities in the Index are updated on the last\nbusiness day of each month. As of February 29, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund comprised companies\nlocated in Europe and Japan, although this may change from time to time. As of February 29, 2024, there were\napproximately 303 securities in the Index and the dollar-weighted average maturity of the securities in the\nIndex was 1.90 years. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d ),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of the\nIndex, relative weightings of the securities in the Index and publishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in\nthe Fund. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes in\ngeneral economic conditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile and prices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates,\ninflation, changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and general market liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and adversely affect\nglobal economies and markets. Local, regional or global events such as war, military conflicts, acts of\nterrorism, natural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of\ndebt securities may increase or decrease as a result of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent\nthat interest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on the\nliquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and increased volatility of the fixed income markets.\nDuring periods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have a\nnegative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the extent that interest rates fall,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster than originally anticipated. If the\nprincipal on a debt obligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest rates, the\nincome received by the Fund may decline. Changes in interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on investments in debt securities could trail the\nreturns on other investment options, including investments in equity securities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities are subject to political, regulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S.\nentity, and many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting, auditing, legal and financial report\nstandards comparable to those in the United States. Further, such entities and/or their securities may be\nsubject to risks associated with currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax policy; greater market\nvolatility; differing securities 22 market structures; higher transaction costs; and various administrative\ndifficulties, such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed\nwhen the exchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there may be deviations between the current\nprice of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security on the closed foreign\nmarket. These deviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts greater than those of\nETFs that invest in domestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets may be less liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities traded domestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions on the repatriation\nof capital to the U.S. In addition, to the extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in a foreign\ncurrency, there are special risks such as changes in currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign\ngovernment could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In addition, to the extent investments are made in\na limited number of countries, events in those countries will have a more significant impact on the Fund.\nSovereign Debt Obligations Risk: Investments in debt securities issued by governments or by government\nagencies and instrumentalities involve the risk that the governmental entities responsible for repayment may\nbe unable or unwilling to pay interest and repay principal when due. Any restructuring of a sovereign debt\nobligation held by the Fund will likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of the obligation. In\nthe event of default of sovereign debt, the Fund may be unable to pursue legal action against the sovereign\nissuer or to realize on collateral securing the debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset value per share (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in times of market volatility or periods of steep market declines. Currency Risk: The\nvalue of the Fund's assets may be affected favorably or unfavorably by currency exchange rates, currency\nexchange control regulations, and delays, restrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates may have significant volatility, and changes in the values of\nforeign currencies against the U.S. dollar may result in substantial declines in the values of the Fund's\nassets denominated in foreign currencies. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks of investing in emerging markets\ninclude, among others, greater political and economic instability, greater volatility in currency exchange\nrates, less developed securities markets, possible trade barriers, currency transfer restrictions, a more\nlimited number of potential buyers and issuers, an emerging market country's dependence on revenue from\nparticular commodities or international aid, less governmental supervision and regulation, unavailability of\ncurrency hedging techniques, differences in auditing and financial reporting standards, and less developed\nlegal systems. There is also the potential for unfavorable action such as expropriation, nationalization,\nembargo, and acts of war. The securities of emerging market companies may trade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial market corrections may\nlimit very significantly the liquidity of securities of certain companies in a particular country or\ngeographic region, or of all companies in the country or region. The Fund may be unable to liquidate its\npositions in such securities at any time, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's obligations.\nThese risks are generally greater for investments in frontier market countries, which typically have smaller\neconomies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries. Forward Currency\nContracts Risk: In a forward currency contract, the Fund agrees to buy in the future an amount in one\ncurrency in return for another currency, at an exchange rate determined at the time the contract is entered\ninto. If currency exchange rates have moved against the Fund's position at the time the contract is settled\nor closed, the Fund will lose money on the contract. There is no limit on the extent to which exchange rates\nmay move against the Fund's position. The markets for certain currencies may at times become illiquid, and\nthe Fund may be unable to enter into new forward contracts or to close out existing contracts. Forward\ncurrency contracts are entered into in the over-the-counter market, and the Fund's ability to profit from a\ncontract will depend on the willingness and ability of its counterparty to perform its obligations under the\ncontract. Futures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that calls for the purchase\nor sale of a specific asset at a specific price at a specific future time, or cash settlement of the terms\nof the contract. Transactions in futures contracts can create investment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures contract transaction will result in a much greater loss than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may not be able to close out the futures contract at a favorable\ntime or price. There is no assurance that a 23 liquid secondary market on an exchange will exist for any\nparticular futures contract. In the event no such market exists, it might not be possible to effect closing\ntransactions, and the Fund will be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is also a\nrisk of imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a futures contract may be unable or unwilling to make\ntimely settlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Geographic Focus\nRisk: The performance of a fund that invests significantly in one or more countries or geographic regions\nwill be closely tied to market, currency, economic, political, environmental, or regulatory conditions and\ndevelopments in the countries or regions in which the fund invests, and may be more volatile than the\nperformance of a fund that does not invest significantly in such countries or regions. Europe: Developed and\nemerging market countries in Europe will be significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary controls of\nthe Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union ( \u201c EU \u201d ). Changes in regulations on trade,\ndecreasing imports or exports, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and recessions among European\ncountries may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other European countries. In addition,\none or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. For example, on January 31, 2020,\nthe United Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and, after a\ntransition period, left the EU single market and customs union under the terms of a new trade agreement on\nDecember 31, 2020. The agreement governs the new relationship between the United Kingdom and EU with respect\nto trading goods and services, but critical aspects of the relationship remain unresolved and subject to\nfurther negotiation and agreement. The full scope and nature of the consequences of the exit are not at this\ntime known and are unlikely to be known for a significant period of time. It is also unknown whether the\nUnited Kingdom's exit will increase the likelihood of other countries also departing the EU. Any exits from\nthe EU, or the possibility of such exits, may have a significant impact on the United Kingdom, Europe, and\nglobal economies, which may result in increased volatility and illiquidity, new legal and regulatory\nuncertainties and potentially lower economic growth for such economies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments. In addition, a number of countries in Europe have\nsuffered terrorist attacks and additional attacks may occur in the future. Such attacks may cause\nuncertainty in financial markets and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund\nhas exposure. Japan: The growth of Japan's economy has historically lagged that of its Asian neighbors and\nother major developed economies. The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has\nbeen adversely affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies\nand the economic conditions of its trading partners. China has become an important trading partner with\nJapan, yet the countries' political relationship has become strained. Should political tension increase, it\ncould adversely affect the economy, especially the export sector, and destabilize the region as a whole.\nJapan also remains heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a\nnegative impact on the economy. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its\nvalue may cause a decline in exports that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has, in the past,\nintervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain or reduce the value of the yen. Japanese\nintervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably\nand could cause losses to investors. Japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a significant\npopulation decline in recent years. Japan's labor market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural\nchanges, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to meet the need for\nincreased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan's economic competitiveness. Natural disasters,\nsuch as earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons or tsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Japanese economy and, in turn, the Fund. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline\ndue to falling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by the Fund may call or redeem\nthe securities during periods of falling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be required to reinvest\nin securities paying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying income at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track the performance\nof an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less favorable than that\nof a portfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The structure and composition of the Index will\naffect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology 24 may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by\nthe Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include, and the\nFund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to the component securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a\nresult of rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains to its shareholders to\navoid adverse federal income tax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Index\n( i.e. , achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), the Fund's return may not match the return of\nthe Index. The Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs costs in\nbuying and selling securities. In addition, the Fund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the Index,\nor in some securities not included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of divergence between the\nFund's return and that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or price\nor at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may\nlead to differences between the market price of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the Fund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit the\nability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain market or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk: As a \u201c non-diversified \u201d fund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of portfolio\nsecurities than many other funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a\ndecline in the market value of a particular security held by the Fund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may become diversified for periods of time solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component securities). Restricted Securities\nRisk: The Fund may hold securities that have not been registered for sale to the public under the U.S.\nfederal securities laws. There can be no assurance that a trading market will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Limitations on the resale of these securities may have an adverse effect on\ntheir marketability, and may prevent the Fund from disposing of them promptly at reasonable prices. The Fund\nmay have to bear the expense of registering the securities for resale and the risk of substantial delays in\neffecting the registration. Also, restricted securities may be difficult to value because market quotations\nmay not be readily available, and the securities may have significant volatility. Valuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings, potentially a large portion of the Fund's investment portfolio, may be valued on the\nbasis of factors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market turmoil or\nreduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including \u201c\nfair valued \u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next\nthan if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close\nout a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation\nestablished by the Fund at that time. 25\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide an indication of the risks of investing in the\nFund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's average\nannual returns for certain time periods compare with the average annual returns of the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based securities index. The Fund's past performance (before and after taxes) is not\nnecessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.Updated performance information is\navailable by calling 1-866-787-2257or visiting our website at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Annual Total\nReturns (years ended 12/31) Highest Quarterly Return: 8.05% ( Q4, 2022)\nLowest Quarterly Return:- 7.94% ( Q2, 2022)\n\nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods ended 12/31/23) The after-tax returns presented in the table below\nare calculated using highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the\nimpact of state and local taxes. Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                                                                    \n                                                      OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                                 3.49%    -1.64%     -2.13%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 3.49%    -1.73%     -2.24%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     2.07%    -1.27%     -1.61%    \n  Fund Shares                                                                       \n  Bloomberg 1-3 Year Global Treasury ex-US Capped                                   \n  Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses     4.01%    -1.21%     -1.72%    \n  ortaxes)                                                                          \n  Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index (reflects no  5.72%    -0.32%     0.38%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                            \n                                                                                    \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are James Kramer,\nJoanna Madden and Cynthia Moy. James Kramer is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 1996. Joanna Madden is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2003. Cynthia Moy is a Principal of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in 2007. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers)\nonly in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201c Creation Units. \u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in\nexchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market\nprices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), Fund Shares\nmay trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund\nShares in the secondary\n\n26\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and\ndiscounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Tax Information The Fund's\ndistributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing\nthrough a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Some distributions may be\ntreated as a return of capital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information. 27\n\nSPDR \u00ae FTSE International Government Inflation-Protected Bond ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR FTSE International Government             \n  Inflation-Protected Bond ETF (the\u201cFund\u201d) seeks to  \n  provideinvestment results that, before fees and    \n  expenses, correspond generally to the price and    \n  yield performanceof an index that tracks the       \n  inflation protected sector of the global bond      \n  market outside the United States.                  \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund ( \u201c Fund Shares \u201d ). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions\nand other fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual\nFund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.50%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.50%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $51       $160    $280     $628  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities\n(or \u201c turns over \u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not\nreflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. During the\nmost recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 22% of the average value of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal Investment Strategy In seeking to track the performance of the FTSE International\nInflation-Linked Securities Select Index (the \u201c Index \u201d ), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all of the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund\nmay purchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return characteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will\nbe based on a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these factors,\nSSGA Funds Management, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the Index in approximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its objective. Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total\nassets in the securities comprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the economic characteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt securities that\nare not included in the Index, cash and cash equivalents or money market instruments, such as repurchase\nagreements and money market funds (including money market funds advised by the Adviser). In seeking to track\nthe Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or\n\n28\n\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Fund may use derivatives, including credit default swaps and credit default index swaps, to\nobtain investment exposure that the Adviser expects to correlate closely with the Index, or a portion of the\nIndex, and in managing cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the total return performance of\ninflation-linked bonds outside the United States with fixed-rate coupon payments that are linked to an\ninflation index. Inflation-protected public obligations of the inflation-linked government bond markets of\ndeveloped and emerging market countries, commonly known in the United States as TIPS, are securities issued\nby such governments that are designed to provide inflation protection to investors. The Index includes\ngovernment debt (direct obligations of the issuer country) but does not include quasi-government debt or\ncorporate debt. To be included in the Index, bonds must be linked to an inflation index and (i) meet a\ncountry-specific minimum issue size, depending on the currency in which the issue is denominated; (ii) have\na fixed-rate stated coupon; (iii) have at least one year remaining to maturity at the Index rebalancing\ndate; (iv) settle on or before the Index rebalancing date; and (v) be rated at least C by S&P Global Ratings\n( \u201c S&P \u201d ) or at least Ca by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (excluding defaulted issuers). Securities\nincluded in the Index may include securities that are subject to restrictions on resale under the U.S.\nfederal securities laws ( \u201c restricted securities \u201d ). The Index is a market-value weight, capped total\nreturn index, in which the maximum market capitalization-based weights of each individual country in the\nIndex cannot exceed 22.5% of the total Index weight. The total market weights of countries with more than\n4.6% market weight in the Index cannot collectively exceed 45% of the total Index weight and the number of\ncountries with more than 4.6% market weight in the Index can be no less than five. If the combined weights\nof each country with more than 4.6% market weight exceeds 45% of the total Index weight, then the weights of\nthose countries are reduced in proportion to each country's market capitalizations until they sum to 45%,\nand the weights of the remaining smaller countries are increased in proportion to each country's market\ncapitalizations by the same amount. After the country weights are determined, constituents within each\ncountry are assigned weights in proportion to their market capitalization. When an issuer defaults, is\nassigned a D rating by S&P, or enters into Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. (or\nequivalent in its local market), its bonds remain in the Index until the end of the month. The Index is\nrebalanced monthly, on the last day of the month. Countries covered in the Index as of February 29, 2024\ncomprised: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New\nZealand, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom, although this may change\nfrom time to time. As of February 29, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund comprised companies located in\nEurope, the United Kingdom and the United States, although this may change from time to time. As of February\n29, 2024, there were approximately 176 securities in the Index. The Index is sponsored by FTSE Russell (the\n\u201c Index Provider \u201d ), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition of the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the Index and publishes information\nregarding the market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all investments,\nthere are certain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose money\nby investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and prices of investments can change substantially\ndue to various factors including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest\nrates, inflation, changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and general market\nliquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and\nadversely affect global economies and markets. Local, regional or global events such as war, military\nconflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments. Debt Securities\nRisk: The values of debt securities may increase or decrease as a result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and increased volatility of the fixed\nincome markets. During periods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the\nFund may have a negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the extent that interest\nrates fall, certain underlying obligations may be paid off substantially 29 faster than originally\nanticipated. If the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of principal\nmay have to be reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes in interest rates will likely have a greater\neffect on the values of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on investments in debt securities could\ntrail the returns on other investment options, including investments in equity securities. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk: Non-U.S. securities are subject to political, regulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. entity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting, auditing, legal and financial report\nstandards comparable to those in the United States. Further, such entities and/or their securities may be\nsubject to risks associated with currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax policy; greater market\nvolatility; differing securities market structures; higher transaction costs; and various administrative\ndifficulties, such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed\nwhen the exchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there may be deviations between the current\nprice of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security on the closed foreign\nmarket. These deviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts greater than those of\nETFs that invest in domestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets may be less liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities traded domestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions on the repatriation\nof capital to the U.S. In addition, to the extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in a foreign\ncurrency, there are special risks such as changes in currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign\ngovernment could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In addition, to the extent investments are made in\na limited number of countries, events in those countries will have a more significant impact on the Fund.\nInflation-Indexed Securities Risk: The principal amount of an inflation-indexed security typically increases\nwith inflation and decreases with deflation, as measured by a specified index. It is possible that, in a\nperiod of declining inflation rates, the Fund could receive at maturity less than the initial principal\namount of an inflation-indexed security. Changes in the values of inflation-indexed securities may be\ndifficult to predict, and it is possible that an investment in such securities will have an effect different\nfrom that anticipated. Sovereign Debt Obligations Risk: Investments in debt securities issued by governments\nor by government agencies and instrumentalities involve the risk that the governmental entities responsible\nfor repayment may be unable or unwilling to pay interest and repay principal when due. Any restructuring of\na sovereign debt obligation held by the Fund will likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of\nthe obligation. In the event of default of sovereign debt, the Fund may be unable to pursue legal action\nagainst the sovereign issuer or to realize on collateral securing the debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there may be times when the market price of the shares\nis more than the net asset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset value per share (discount).\nThis risk is heightened in times of market volatility or periods of steep market declines. Below Investment-\nGrade Securities Risk: Lower-quality debt securities ( \u201c high yield \u201d or \u201c junk \u201d bonds) are considered\npredominantly speculative, and can involve a substantially greater risk of default than higher quality debt\nsecurities. Issuers of lower-quality debt securities may have substantially greater risk of insolvency or\nbankruptcy than issuers of higher-quality debt securities. They can be illiquid, and their values can have\nsignificant volatility and may decline significantly over short periods of time. Lower-quality debt\nsecurities tend to be more sensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or the market or economy in general.\nCurrency Risk: The value of the Fund's assets may be affected favorably or unfavorably by currency exchange\nrates, currency exchange control regulations, and delays, restrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation\nof foreign currencies. Foreign currency exchange rates may have significant volatility, and changes in the\nvalues of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar may result in substantial declines in the values of the\nFund's assets denominated in foreign currencies. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks of investing in emerging\nmarkets include, among others, greater political and economic instability, greater volatility in currency\nexchange rates, less developed securities markets, possible trade barriers, currency transfer restrictions,\na more limited number of potential buyers and issuers, an emerging market country's dependence on revenue\nfrom particular commodities or international aid, less governmental supervision and regulation,\nunavailability of currency hedging techniques, differences in auditing and financial reporting 30 standards,\nand less developed legal systems. There is also the potential for unfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The securities of emerging market companies may trade less\nfrequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial market\ncorrections may limit very significantly the liquidity of securities of certain companies in a particular\ncountry or geographic region, or of all companies in the country or region. The Fund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions in such securities at any time, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for investments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries.\nGeographic Focus Risk: The performance of a fund that invests significantly in one or more countries or\ngeographic regions will be closely tied to market, currency, economic, political, environmental, or\nregulatory conditions and developments in the countries or regions in which the fund invests, and may be\nmore volatile than the performance of a fund that does not invest significantly in such countries or\nregions. Europe: Developed and emerging market countries in Europe will be significantly affected by the\nfiscal and monetary controls of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union ( \u201c EU \u201d ). Changes in\nregulations on trade, decreasing imports or exports, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and recessions\namong European countries may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other European countries.\nIn addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. For example, on January\n31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and, after\na transition period, left the EU single market and customs union under the terms of a new trade agreement on\nDecember 31, 2020. The agreement governs the new relationship between the United Kingdom and EU with respect\nto trading goods and services, but critical aspects of the relationship remain unresolved and subject to\nfurther negotiation and agreement. The full scope and nature of the consequences of the exit are not at this\ntime known and are unlikely to be known for a significant period of time. It is also unknown whether the\nUnited Kingdom's exit will increase the likelihood of other countries also departing the EU. Any exits from\nthe EU, or the possibility of such exits, may have a significant impact on the United Kingdom, Europe, and\nglobal economies, which may result in increased volatility and illiquidity, new legal and regulatory\nuncertainties and potentially lower economic growth for such economies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments. In addition, a number of countries in Europe have\nsuffered terrorist attacks and additional attacks may occur in the future. Such attacks may cause\nuncertainty in financial markets and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund\nhas exposure. United Kingdom: The United Kingdom has one of the largest economies in Europe, and the United\nStates and other European countries are substantial trading partners of the United Kingdom. As a result, the\nBritish economy may be impacted by changes to the economic condition of the United States and other European\ncountries. The British economy relies heavily on the export of financial services to the United States and\nother European countries and, therefore, a prolonged slowdown in the financial services sector may have a\nnegative impact on the British economy. Continued governmental involvement or control in certain sectors may\nstifle competition in certain sectors or cause adverse effects on economic growth. On January 31, 2020, the\nUnited Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and, after a transition\nperiod, left the EU single market and customs union under the terms of a new trade agreement on December 31,\n2020. The agreement governs the new relationship between the United Kingdom and EU with respect to trading\ngoods and services, but critical aspects of the relationship remain unresolved and subject to further\nnegotiation and agreement. There is still considerable uncertainty relating to the potential consequences\nassociated with the exit and whether the United Kingdom's exit will increase the likelihood of other\ncountries also departing the EU. Any exits from the EU, or the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom, Europe, and global economies, which may result in increased\nvolatility and illiquidity, new legal and regulatory uncertainties and potentially lower economic growth for\nthese economies that could potentially have an adverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments. In\naddition, the United Kingdom has been a target of terrorism in the past. Acts of terrorism in the United\nKingdom or against British interests abroad may cause uncertainty in the British financial markets and\nadversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Income Risk: The Fund's\nincome may decline due to falling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by the Fund\nmay call or redeem the securities during periods of falling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in securities paying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the Fund is\nprepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying income at lower rates. 31\nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment strategy, attempting\nto track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual securities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-\nmanaged fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The structure and\ncomposition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently,\nthe performance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of companies that do not\nalign with the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to the component securities of\nthe Index and the Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. The\nFund may recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to reflect\nchanges in the securities included in the Index. The Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling securities. In addition, the Fund may not be fully invested at\ntimes, generally as a result of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to\nmeet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities not included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed\nmarket conditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's\nholdings deteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market price of Fund Shares and the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid investments and/or the difficulty in\npurchasing and selling such investments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-Diversification Risk: As a \u201c non-diversified \u201d fund, the Fund may hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio securities than many other funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a decline in the market value of a particular security held by the Fund may affect its\nvalue more than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile\nthan the values of shares of more diversified funds. The Fund may become diversified for periods of time\nsolely as a result of tracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component securities).\nRestricted Securities Risk: The Fund may hold securities that have not been registered for sale to the\npublic under the U.S. federal securities laws. There can be no assurance that a trading market will exist at\nany time for any particular restricted security. Limitations on the resale of these securities may have an\nadverse effect on their marketability, and may prevent the Fund from disposing of them promptly at\nreasonable prices. The Fund may have to bear the expense of registering the securities for resale and the\nrisk of substantial delays in effecting the registration. Also, restricted securities may be difficult to\nvalue because market quotations may not be readily available, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party contract that generally obligates the parties to exchange\npayments based on a specified reference security, basket of securities, security index or index component.\nSwaps can involve greater risks than direct investment in securities because swaps may be leveraged and are\nsubject to counterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the obligation or\nbankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It may not be possible\nfor the Fund to liquidate a swap position at an advantageous time or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Valuation Risk: Some portfolio holdings, potentially a large portion of the Fund's investment\nportfolio, may be valued on the basis of factors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a\nportfolio holding when market quotations are not readily available. The value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it\nhad been priced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than\nmarket quotations, including \u201c fair valued \u201d securities, 32\n\nmay be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if market quotations\nwere used. In addition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for\nthe value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime. Fund Performance The following bar chart and table provide an indication of the risks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's\naverage annual returns for certain time periods compare with the average annual returns of the Index and of\na relevant broad-based securities index. The Fund's past performance (before and after taxes) is not\nnecessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.Updated performance information is\navailable by calling 1-866-787-2257or visiting our website at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Annual Total\nReturns (years ended 12/31) Highest Quarterly Return: 9.81% ( Q4, 2023)\nLowest Quarterly Return:- 13.99% ( Q2, 2022)\n\nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods ended 12/31/23) The after-tax returns presented in the table below\nare calculated using highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the\nimpact of state and local taxes. Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.Effective February 12, 2016 (the \u201c Benchmark Index Change\nDate \u201d ), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the DB Global Government ex-U.S. Inflation-Linked Bond\nCapped Index (the \u201c Previous Benchmark Index \u201d ) to the FTSE International Inflation-Linked Securities\nSelect Index, consistent with a change in the Fund's principal investment strategy to track the performance\nof the current index. Performance of the Fund prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date is therefore based on\nthe Fund's investment strategy to track the Previous Benchmark Index.\n                                                                                    \n                                                      OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                                 8.74%    0.76%      0.23%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 6.99%    -0.77%     -0.78%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     5.12%    -0.02%     -0.19%    \n  Fund Shares                                                                       \n  FTSE International Inflation-Linked Securities                                    \n  Select Index/DB Global Government                                                 \n  ex-U.S.Inflation-Linked Bond Capped                 9.51%    1.42%      0.82%     \n  Index1,2(reflects no deduction for fees, expenses                                 \n  or taxes)                                                                         \n  Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index (reflects no  5.72%    -0.32%     0.38%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                            \n                                                                                    \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the Index for periods beginning on the Benchmark Index Change Date and the\nPrevious Benchmark Index for periods prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date. 2 Prior to May 31, 2018, the\nFTSE International Inflation-Linked Securities Select Index was named the Citi International Inflation-\nLinked Securities Select Index. Portfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment\nadviser to the Fund. Portfolio Managers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are James Kramer, Cynthia Moy and Joanna Madden. James Kramer is a Vice President of\nthe Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser\nin 1996. Cynthia Moy is a Principal of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in 2007.\n\n33\n\nJoanna Madden is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions\nGroup. She joined the Adviser in 2003. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund\nShares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201c Creation Units. \u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for\nthe deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because\nFund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), Fund Shares may trade at a\nprice greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is\nwilling to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums\nand discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Tax Information The Fund's\ndistributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing\nthrough a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Some distributions may be\ntreated as a return of capital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information. 34 Additional Strategies Information Principal Strategies General . Please see\neach Fund's \u201c The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy \u201d section under \u201c Fund Summaries \u201d above for a\ndiscussion of each Fund's principal investment strategies. A Fund may invest in various types of securities\nand engage in various investment techniques which are not the principal focus of the Fund and therefore are\nnot described in this Prospectus. These securities, techniques and practices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional Information (the \u201c SAI \u201d ), which you may obtain free of charge by\ncontacting shareholder services (see the back cover of this Prospectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of each Fund's Index as closely as possible (i.e ., obtain a high\ndegree of correlation with the Index). A number of factors may affect a Fund's ability to achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with its Index, and there can be no guarantee that a Fund will achieve a high degree\nof correlation. For example, a Fund may not be able to achieve a high degree of correlation with its Index\nwhen there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved in compiling a portfolio of securities\nto follow the Index, when a security in the Index becomes temporarily illiquid, unavailable or less liquid,\nor legal restrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from investing in a security in the Index. The Adviser\nwill utilize a sampling strategy in managing the Funds. Sampling means that the Adviser uses quantitative\nanalysis to select securities, including securities in the Index, outside of the Index and derivatives that\nhave a similar investment profile as the relevant Index in terms of key risk factors, performance attributes\nand other economic characteristics. These include industry weightings, market capitalization, and other\nfinancial characteristics of securities. The quantity of holdings in a Fund will be based on a number of\nfactors, including asset size of the Fund. In addition, from time to time, securities are added to or\nremoved from each Index. The Adviser may sell securities that are represented in an Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in an Index, in anticipation of their removal from or addition to an\nIndex. Further, the Adviser may choose to overweight securities in an Index, purchase or sell securities not\nin an Index, or utilize various combinations of other available techniques, in seeking to track an Index.\nEach Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy to invest at least 80% of its respective net\nassets, plus the amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in investments suggested by its name,\nmeasured at the time of investment. A Fund will provide shareholders with at least 60 days' notice prior to\nany change in this non-fundamental 80% investment policy. The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201c Board \u201d\n) may change a Fund's investment strategy, Index and other policies without shareholder approval, except as\notherwise indicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI. The Board may also change a Fund's investment\nobjective without shareholder approval. Non-Principal Strategies Certain Other Investments . Each Fund may\ninvest in structured notes (notes on which the amount of principal repayment and interest payments are based\non the movement of one or more specified factors such as the movement of a particular security or index),\nswaps, options and futures contracts. Swaps, options and futures contracts and structured notes may be used\nby a Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to its Index and in managing cash flows. Temporary\nDefensive Positions . In certain situations or market conditions, a Fund may temporarily depart from its\nnormal investment policies and strategies, provided that the alternative is consistent with the Fund's\ninvestment objective and is in the best interest of the Fund. For example, a Fund may make larger than\nnormal investments in derivatives to maintain exposure to its Index if it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . Each Fund may borrow money from a bank as permitted by the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended ( \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ), or other governing statute, by the rules thereunder, or by\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( \u201c SEC \u201d ) or other regulatory agency with authority over the\nFund, but only for temporary or emergency purposes. The 1940 Act presently allows a Fund to borrow from any\nbank (including pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total assets\n(not including temporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of its total assets). A Fund may also invest in\nreverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions. Consistent with a rule under the 1940 Act,\na Fund may treat such investments as either borrowings or derivatives 35 transactions. To the extent a Fund\ntreats reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions as borrowings, such investments will\nalso be included in the 33 1/3% limit. Under normal circumstances, any borrowings by a Fund (including\ninvestments in reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions treated as borrowings) will\nnot exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. Lending of Securities . Each Fund may lend its portfolio\nsecurities in an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets via a securities lending program\nthrough its securities lending agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company ( \u201c State Street \u201d or the \u201c\nLending Agent \u201d ), to brokers, dealers and other financial institutions desiring to borrow securities to\ncomplete transactions and for other purposes. A securities lending program allows a Fund to receive a\nportion of the income generated by lending its securities and investing the respective collateral. A Fund\nwill receive collateral for each loaned security which is at least equal to the market value of that\nsecurity, marked to market each trading day. To the extent a Fund receives cash collateral, as of the date\nof this Prospectus, the Adviser expects to invest such cash collateral in a fund managed by the Adviser that\ninvests in: a broad range of money market instruments; certificates of deposit and time deposits of U.S. and\nforeign banks; commercial paper and other high quality obligations of U.S. or foreign companies; asset-\nbacked securities; mortgage-related securities; repurchase agreements; and shares of money market funds.\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based\non the amount of cash collateral. A Fund is compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the\nreinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash,\na Fund is compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned\nsecurities. In the securities lending program, the borrower generally has the right to vote the loaned\nsecurities; however, a Fund may call loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the Fund's economic\ninterest in the investment is to be voted upon. Security loans may be terminated at any time by a Fund.\nAdditional Risk Information The following section provides information regarding the principal risks\nidentified under \u201c Principal Risks

Securities rated below investment-grade and unrated securities of\ncomparable credit quality (commonly known as \u201c high-yield \u201d or \u201c junk \u201d bonds) lack strong investment-grade\ncharacteristics, are considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to\nmake principal and interest payments, and are subject to greater levels of credit, liquidity and market risk\nthan higher-rated securities. They can involve a substantially greater risk of default than higher-rated\nsecurities, and their values can decline significantly over short periods of time. Issuers of lower-quality\ndebt securities may have substantially greater risk of insolvency or bankruptcy than issuers of higher-\nquality debt securities. In the event the issuer of a debt security held by a Fund defaults on its payments\nor becomes insolvent or bankrupt, the Fund may not receive the return it was promised on the investment and\ncould lose its entire investment. The lower ratings of junk bonds reflect a greater possibility that actual\nor perceived adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer or in general economic conditions, or\nan unanticipated rise in interest rates, may impair the ability of the issuer to make payments of interest\nand principal. If this were to occur, the values of such securities held by a Fund may fall substantially\nand a Fund could lose some or all of the value of its investment. Lower-quality debt securities tend to be\nmore sensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or the market or economy in general, than higher quality\ndebt securities. The market for lower quality debt securities can be less liquid than for higher quality\ndebt securities, especially during periods of recession or general market decline, which could make it\ndifficult at times for a Fund to sell certain securities at prices used in calculating a Fund's net asset\nvalue. These securities may have significant volatility. Call/Prepayment Risk . Call/prepayment risk is the\nrisk that an issuer will exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation held by a Fund earlier than\nexpected or required. This may occur, for example, when there is a decline in interest rates, and an issuer\nof bonds or preferred stock redeems the bonds or stock in order to replace them with obligations on which it\nis required to pay a lower interest or dividend rate. It may also occur when there is an unanticipated\nincrease in the rate at which mortgages or other receivables underlying mortgage- or asset-backed securities\nheld by a Fund are prepaid. In any such case, a Fund may be forced to invest the prepaid amounts in lower-\nyielding investments, resulting in a decline in the Fund's income. Counterparty Risk . A Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties with which the Fund enters into derivatives\ncontracts and other transactions such as repurchase agreements or reverse repurchase agreements. A Fund's\nability to profit from these types of investments and transactions will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its obligations. If a counterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, a Fund may be unable to terminate or realize any gain on the investment or transaction,\nresulting in a loss to the Fund. A Fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in an\ninsolvency, bankruptcy, or other reorganization proceeding involving its counterparty (including recovery of\nany collateral posted by it) and may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such\ncircumstances. If a Fund holds collateral posted by its counterparty, it may be delayed or prevented from\nrealizing on the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or contractual provisions, including if a Fund enters into an investment\nor transaction with a financial institution and such financial institution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial difficulties, then the Fund may in certain situations be prevented or\ndelayed from exercising its rights to terminate the investment or transaction, or to realize on any\ncollateral and may result in the suspension of payment and delivery obligations of the parties under such\ninvestment or transactions or in another institution being substituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, a Fund may be subject to \u201c bail-in \u201d risk under applicable law\nwhereby, if required by the financial institution's authority, the financial institution's liabilities could\nbe written down, eliminated or converted into equity or an alternative instrument of ownership. A bail-in of\na financial institution may result in a reduction in value of some or all of its securities and, if a Fund\nholds such securities or has entered into a transaction with such a financial security when a bail-in\noccurs, such Fund may also be similarly impacted. Credit Risk . Credit risk is the risk that an issuer,\nguarantor or liquidity provider of a fixed-income security held by a Fund may be unable or unwilling, or may\nbe perceived (whether by market participants, ratings agencies, pricing services or otherwise) as unable or\nunwilling, to make timely principal and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. It\nincludes the risk that the security will be downgraded by a credit rating agency; generally, lower credit\nquality issuers present higher credit risks. An actual or perceived decline in creditworthiness of an issuer\nof a fixed-income security held by a Fund may result in a decrease in the value of the security. It is\npossible that the ability of an issuer to meet its obligations will decline substantially during the period\nwhen a Fund owns securities of the issuer or that the issuer will default on its obligations or that the\nobligations of the issuer will be limited or restructured. 39 The credit rating assigned to any particular\ninvestment does not necessarily reflect the issuer's current financial condition and does not reflect an\nassessment of an investment's volatility or liquidity. Securities rated in the lowest category of\ninvestment-grade are considered to have speculative characteristics. If a security held by a Fund loses its\nrating or its rating is downgraded, the Fund may nonetheless continue to hold the security in the discretion\nof the Adviser. In the case of asset-backed or mortgage-related securities, changes in the actual or\nperceived ability of the obligors on the underlying assets or mortgages to make payments of interest and/or\nprincipal may affect the values of those securities. Currency Risk . Investments in issuers in different\ncountries are often denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the values of those\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar may have a positive or negative effect on the values of a Fund's\ninvestments denominated in those currencies. The values of other currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may\nfluctuate in response to, among other factors, interest rate changes, intervention (or failure to intervene)\nby national governments, central banks, or supranational entities such as the International Monetary Fund,\nthe imposition of currency controls, and other political or regulatory developments. Currency values can\ndecrease significantly both in the short term and over the long term in response to these and other\ndevelopments. Continuing uncertainty as to the status of the Euro and the Economic and Monetary Union of the\nEuropean Union (the \u201c EMU \u201d ) has created significant volatility in currency and financial markets\ngenerally. Any partial or complete dissolution of the EMU, or any continued uncertainty as to its status,\ncould have significant adverse effects on currency and financial markets, and on the values of a Fund's\nportfolio investments. Debt Securities Risk . The values of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments\nor illiquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially slower than originally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest rate environment may cause the value of a Fund's fixed income\nsecurities to decrease, a decline in a Fund's income and yield, an adverse impact on the liquidity of a\nFund's fixed income securities, and increased volatility of the fixed income markets. During periods when\ninterest rates are at low levels, a Fund's yield can be low, and a Fund may have a negative yield (i.e., it\nmay lose money on an operating basis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of principal may have to be reinvested in obligations\npaying interest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest rates, the income received by a Fund may\ndecline. Changes in interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the values of debt securities of\nlonger durations. Returns on investments in debt securities could trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity securities. High levels of inflation and/or a significantly\nchanging interest rate environment can lead to heightened levels of volatility and reduced liquidity.\nDerivatives Risk. A derivative is a financial contract the value of which depends on, or is derived from,\nthe value of an underlying asset, interest rate, or index. Derivative transactions typically involve\nleverage and may have significant volatility. It is possible that a derivative transaction will result in a\nloss greater than the principal amount invested, and a Fund may not be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price. Risks associated with derivative instruments include potential\nchanges in value in response to interest rate changes or other market developments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential for the derivative transaction not to have the effect the\nAdviser anticipated or a different or less favorable effect than the Adviser anticipated; the failure of the\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction to perform its obligations under the transaction or to settle a\ntrade; possible mispricing or improper valuation of the derivative instrument; imperfect correlation in the\nvalue of a derivative with the asset, rate, or index underlying the derivative; the risk that a Fund may be\nrequired to post collateral or margin with its counterparty, and will not be able to recover the collateral\nor margin in the event of the counterparty's insolvency or bankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will experience\nlosses on its derivatives investments and on its other portfolio investments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or entirely to hedge those portfolio investments; the risks specific to\nthe asset underlying the derivative instrument; lack of liquidity for the derivative instrument, including,\nwithout limitation, absence of a secondary trading market; the potential for reduced returns to a Fund due\nto losses on the transaction and an increase in volatility; the potential for the derivative transaction to\nhave the effect of accelerating the recognition of gain; and legal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction. 40 Forward Currency Contracts Risk . In a forward currency contract,\na Fund agrees to buy in the future an amount in one currency in return for another currency, at an exchange\nrate determined at the time the contract is entered into. If currency exchange rates have moved against the\nFund's position at the time the contract is settled or closed, the Fund will lose money on the contract.\nThere is no limit on the extent to which exchange rates may move against a Fund's position. The markets for\ncertain currencies may at times become illiquid, and a Fund may be unable to enter into new forward\ncontracts or to close out existing contracts. Forward currency contracts are entered into in the over-the-\ncounter market, and a Fund's ability to profit from a contract will depend on the willingness and ability of\nits counterparty to perform its obligations under the contract. Use by a Fund of foreign currency forward\ncontracts may give rise to investment leverage. Futures Contract Risk . The risk of loss relating to the use\nof futures contracts is potentially unlimited. The ability to establish and close out positions in futures\ncontracts will be subject to the development and maintenance of a liquid secondary market. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange will exist for any particular futures contract or at\nany particular time. In the event no such market exists, it might not be possible to effect closing\ntransactions, and a Fund will be unable to terminate the futures contract. In using futures contracts, a\nFund will be reliant on the ability of the Adviser to predict market and price movements correctly; the\nskills needed to use such futures contracts successfully are different from those needed for traditional\nportfolio management. If a Fund uses futures contracts for hedging purposes, there is a risk of imperfect\ncorrelation between movements in the prices of the futures contracts and movements in the securities or\nindex underlying the futures contracts or movements in the prices of the Fund's investments that are the\nsubject of such hedge. The prices of futures contracts, for a number of reasons, may not correlate perfectly\nwith movements in the securities or index underlying them. For example, participants in the futures markets\nare subject to margin deposit requirements. Such requirements may cause investors to take actions with\nrespect to their futures positions that they would not otherwise take. The margin requirements in the\nfutures markets may be less onerous than margin requirements in the securities markets in general, and as a\nresult those markets may attract more speculators than the securities markets do. Increased participation by\nspeculators in those markets may cause temporary price distortions. Due to the possibility of price\ndistortion, even a correct forecast of general market trends by the Adviser still may not result in a\nsuccessful futures activity over a very short time period. The risk of a position in a futures contract may\nbe very large compared to the relatively low level of margin a Fund is required to deposit. A Fund will\ntypically be required to post margin with its futures commission merchant in connection with its\ntransactions in futures contracts. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract\nmay result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative to the size of a required\nmargin deposit. A Fund will incur brokerage fees in connection with its futures transactions. In the event\nof an insolvency of the futures commission merchant or a clearing house, a Fund may not be able to recover\nall (or any) of the margin it has posted with the futures commission merchant, or to realize the value of\nany increase in the price of its positions, or it may experience a significant delay in doing so. The\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) and the various exchanges have established limits\nreferred to as \u201c speculative position limits \u201d on the maximum net long or net short positions that any\nperson and certain affiliated entities may hold or control in a particular futures contract. In addition,\nfederal position limits apply to swaps that are economically equivalent to futures contracts that are\nsubject to CFTC-set speculative limits. All positions owned or controlled by the same person or entity, even\nif in different accounts, must be aggregated for purposes of complying with position limits. It is possible\nthat the positions of different clients managed by the Adviser may be aggregated for this purpose.\nTherefore, the trading decisions of the Adviser may have to be modified and positions held by a Fund\nliquidated in order to avoid exceeding such limits. The modification of investment decisions or the\nelimination of open positions, if it occurs, may adversely affect the performance of a Fund. A violation of\nposition limits could also lead to regulatory action materially adverse to a Fund's investment strategy. In\naddition, exchanges may establish accountability levels applicable to a futures contract instead of position\nlimits, provided that the futures contract is not subject to federal position limits. An exchange may order\na person who holds or controls a position in excess of a position accountability level not to further\nincrease its position, to comply with any prospective limit that exceeds the size of the position owned or\ncontrolled, or to reduce any open position that exceeds the position accountability level if the exchange\ndetermines that such action is necessary to maintain an orderly market. Position accountability levels could\nadversely affect a Fund's ability to establish and maintain positions in commodity futures contracts to\nwhich such levels apply, if the Fund were to trade in such contracts, and a Fund's ability to achieve its\ninvestment objective. 41 Futures contracts traded on markets outside the U.S. are not generally subject to\nthe same level of regulation by the CFTC or other U.S. regulatory entities as contracts traded in the U.S.,\nincluding without limitation as to the execution, delivery, and clearing of transactions. U.S. regulators\nneither regulate the activities of a foreign exchange, nor have the power to compel enforcement of the rules\nof the foreign exchange or the laws of the foreign country in question. Margin and other payments made by a\nFund may not be afforded the same protections as are afforded those payments in the U.S., including in\nconnection with the insolvency of an executing or clearing broker or a clearinghouse or exchange. Certain\nforeign futures contracts may be less liquid and more volatile than U.S. contracts. Swaps Risk. A swap is a\ntwo-party contract that generally obligates the parties to exchange payments based on a specified reference\nsecurity, basket of securities, security index or index component. Swaps can involve greater risks than\ndirect investment in securities because swaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk ( e.g. ,\nthe risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk (\ni.e. , swaps may be difficult to value). Swaps may also be considered illiquid. It may not be possible for a\nFund to liquidate a swap position at an advantageous time or price, which may result in significant losses.\nEmerging Markets Risk . Investments in emerging markets are generally subject to a greater risk of loss than\ninvestments in developed markets. This may be due to, among other things, the possibility of greater market\nvolatility, lower trading volume and liquidity, greater risk of expropriation, nationalization, and social,\npolitical and economic instability, greater reliance on a few industries, international trade or revenue\nfrom particular commodities, less developed accounting, legal and regulatory systems, higher levels of\ninflation, deflation or currency devaluation, greater risk of market shutdown, and more significant\ngovernmental limitations on investment policy as compared to those typically found in a developed market.\nThere may be limited legal rights and remedies for investors in companies domiciled in emerging markets. In\naddition, issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may have less financial stability\nthan in other countries. The securities of emerging market companies may trade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial market corrections may\nlimit very significantly the liquidity of securities of certain companies in a particular country or\ngeographic region, or of all companies in the country or region. A Fund may be unable to liquidate its\npositions in such securities at any time, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's obligations.\nThere is also the potential for unfavorable action such as embargo and acts of war. As a result, there will\ntend to be an increased risk of price volatility in investments in emerging market countries, which may be\nmagnified by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Settlement and asset custody practices for\ntransactions in emerging markets may differ from those in developed markets. Such differences may include\npossible delays in settlement and certain settlement practices, such as delivery of securities prior to\nreceipt of payment, which increase the likelihood of a \u201c failed settlement. \u201d Failed settlements can result\nin losses. For these and other reasons, investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative.\nExtension Risk . During periods of rising interest rates, the average life of certain types of securities\nmay be extended because of slower-than-expected principal payments. This may increase the period of time\nduring which an investment earns a below-market interest rate, increase the security's duration and reduce\nthe value of the security. Extension risk may be heightened during periods of adverse economic conditions\ngenerally, as payment rates decline due to higher unemployment levels and other factors. Financial Sector\nRisk . Financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which may limit both\nthe amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make, the interest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and the amount of capital they\nmust maintain. Profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can\nfluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and international credit and interbank money markets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause an unusually\nhigh degree of volatility in the financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain financial\nservices companies to incur large losses. Securities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience substantial declines in the valuations of their\nassets, take action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt or equity securities), or cease\noperations. Credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated\nwith investment activities can 42 negatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be subject to severe\nprice competition. Adverse economic, business or political developments could adversely affect financial\ninstitutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk .\nThe net asset value of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of a Fund's\nsecurities holdings. The market prices of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in\na Fund's net asset value and supply and demand of Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be predicted\nwhether Fund Shares will trade below, at or above their net asset value. Price differences may be due, in\nlarge part, to the fact that supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for Fund\nShares will be closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the\nsecurities of an Index trading individually or in the aggregate at any point in time. The market prices of\nFund Shares may deviate significantly from the net asset value of Fund Shares during periods of market\nvolatility. However, given that Fund Shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units (unlike shares of\nmany closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to,\ntheir net asset value), the Adviser believes that large discounts or premiums to the net asset value of Fund\nShares should not be sustained over long periods. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make\nit likely that Fund Shares normally will trade close to a Fund's net asset value, disruptions to creations\nand redemptions or market volatility may result in trading prices that differ significantly from such Fund's\nnet asset value. If an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time when the market price is at a premium to the\nnet asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a time when the market price is at a discount to the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares, then the investor may sustain losses. Geographic Focus Risk . The performance of a\nfund that invests significantly in one or more countries or geographic regions will be closely tied to\nmarket, currency, economic, political, environmental, or regulatory conditions and developments in the\ncountries or regions in which the fund invests, and may be more volatile than the performance of a fund that\ndoes not invest significantly in such countries or regions. Asia . Certain Asian economies have experienced\nhigh inflation, high unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit.\nMany Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization, and there is no assurance that\nthis growth rate will be maintained. Economic events in any one Asian country may have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire Asian region, as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse\nevent in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the\ncountries in which a Fund invests. Many Asian countries are subject to political risk, including corruption\nand regional conflict with neighboring countries. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social\nand labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund's investments. Europe . The Economic and Monetary\nUnion of the EU requires compliance with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt\nlevels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe.\nDecreasing imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the default or threat of default by an EU\nmember country on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member country may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on the economies of EU member countries and their trading partners. The European\nfinancial markets have recently experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic\ndownturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy,\nPortugal and Spain. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to\nsignificantly affect every country in Europe, including countries that do not use the euro. Responses to the\nfinancial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and\neconomic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments\nand other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and\nasset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw\nfrom the EU. For example, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom ( \u201c UK \u201d ) formally withdrew from the EU\n(commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and, after a transition period, left the EU single market and customs\nunion under the terms of a new trade agreement on December 31, 2020. The agreement governs the new\nrelationship between the UK and EU with respect to trading goods and services, but critical aspects of the\nrelationship remain 43 unresolved and subject to further negotiation and agreement. Certain aspects of\nBrexit have had an adverse impact on the region, leading to increased inflation, labor shortages and\nbusiness closures, among others. The full scope and nature of the consequences of the exit are not at this\ntime known and are unlikely to be known for a significant period of time. It is also unknown whether the\nUK's exit will increase the likelihood of other countries also departing the EU. Any exits from the EU, or\nthe possibility of such exits, may have a significant impact on the UK, Europe, and global economies, which\nmay result in increased volatility and illiquidity, new legal and regulatory uncertainties and potentially\nlower economic growth for such economies that could potentially have an adverse effect on the value of the\nFund's investments. In addition, a number of countries in Europe have suffered terrorist attacks and\nadditional attacks may occur in the future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty in financial markets and may\nadversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Japan. The growth of Japan's\neconomy has historically lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed economies. The\nJapanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected by trade\ntariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions of\nits trading partners. China has become an important trading partner with Japan, yet the countries' political\nrelationship has become strained. Should political tension increase, it could adversely affect the economy,\nespecially the export sector, and destabilize the region as a whole. Japan also remains heavily dependent on\noil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a negative impact on the economy. The Japanese\neconomy faces several other concerns, including a financial system with large levels of nonperforming loans,\nover-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by major corporations, a changing\ncorporate governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may cause a slowdown of the\nJapanese economy. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its value may cause a\ndecline in exports that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in the\ncurrency markets to attempt to maintain or reduce the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the\ncurrency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and could cause\nlosses to investors. Japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in\nrecent years. Japan's labor market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor\nmarket traditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to meet the need for increased labor\nmobility, which may adversely affect Japan's economic competitiveness. Natural disasters, such as\nearthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons or tsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding areas and could negatively\naffect the Japanese economy and, in turn, a Fund. United Kingdom. The UK has one of the largest economies in\nEurope, and the United States and other European countries are substantial trading partners of the UK. As a\nresult, the British economy may be impacted by changes to the economic condition of the United States and\nother European countries. The British economy relies heavily on the export of financial services to the\nUnited States and other European countries and, therefore, a prolonged slowdown in the financial services\nsector may have a negative impact on the British economy. Continued governmental involvement or control in\ncertain sectors may stifle competition in certain sectors or cause adverse effects on economic growth. In\nthe past, the UK has been a target of terrorism. Acts of terrorism in the UK or against British interests\nabroad may cause uncertainty in the British financial markets and adversely affect the performance of the\nissuers to which a Fund has exposure. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU\n(commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and, after a transition period, left the EU single market and customs\nunion under the terms of a new trade agreement on December 31, 2020. The agreement governs the new\nrelationship between the United Kingdom and EU with respect to trading goods and services, but critical\naspects of the relationship remain unresolved and subject to further negotiation and agreement. Certain\naspects of Brexit have had an adverse impact on the region, leading to increased inflation, labor shortages\nand business closures, among others. There is still considerable uncertainty relating to the potential\nconsequences associated with the exit and whether the United Kingdom's exit will increase the likelihood of\nother countries also departing the EU. Brexit may have a significant impact on the United Kingdom, Europe,\nand global economies, which may result in increased volatility and illiquidity, new legal and regulatory\nuncertainties and potentially lower economic growth for these economies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of a Fund's investments. 44 Income Risk. A Fund's income may decline due to\nfalling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by a Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be required to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by a Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying income at lower rates. A reduction in the income earned\nby a Fund may limit the Fund's ability to achieve its objective. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk .\nEach Fund is managed with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities. Each Fund will seek to provide investment results that correspond generally\nto the performance of the Index, regardless of the current or projected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. Each Fund generally will buy and will not sell a security included in the\nIndex as long as the security is part of the Index regardless of any sudden or material decline in value or\nforeseeable material decline in value of the security, even though the Adviser may make a different\ninvestment decision for other actively managed accounts or portfolios that hold the security. As a result, a\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of\nthe Index (in absolute terms and by comparison with other indices) and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of a Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on a Fund and its\nshareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, an Index may include, and the\ncorresponding Fund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of companies that do not align with\nthe Index's objective and/or criteria. While the Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Index (i.e.,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), a Fund's return may not match the return of the Index\nfor a number of reasons. For example, the return on the sample of securities purchased by a Fund (or the\nreturn on securities not included in the Index) may not correlate precisely with the return of the Index.\nEach Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs costs in buying and\nselling securities. In addition, a Fund may not be fully invested at times, either as a result of cash flows\ninto or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of divergence between a Fund's return and that of\nthe Index. Changes in the composition of the Index and regulatory requirements also may impact a Fund's\nability to match the return of the Index. The Adviser may apply one or more \u201c screens \u201d or investment\ntechniques to refine or limit the number or types of issuers included in the Index in which a Fund may\ninvest. Application of such screens or techniques may result in investment performance below that of the\nIndex and may not produce results expected by the Adviser. Index tracking risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Pursuant to each Index methodology,\na security may be removed from an Index in the event that it does not comply with the eligibility\nrequirements of the Index. As a result, a Fund may be forced to sell securities at inopportune times and/or\nunfavorable prices due to these changes in the Index components. When there are changes made to the\ncomponent securities of an Index and the corresponding Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio\nto attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund's portfolio and the Index, any transaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising from such portfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnscheduled changes to an Index may expose the corresponding Fund to additional tracking error risk. A Fund\nmay recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to reflect changes\nin the securities included in the corresponding Index. A Fund also may be required to distribute any such\ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax consequences. Industrial Sector Risk .\nIndustrial companies are affected by supply and demand both for their specific product or service and for\nindustrial sector products and services in general. Government regulation, world events, exchange rates and\neconomic conditions, technological developments and liabilities for environmental damage and general civil\nliabilities will likewise affect the performance of these companies. Aerospace and defense companies, a\ncomponent of the industrial sector, can be significantly affected by government spending policies because\ncompanies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and foreign government demand for\ntheir products and services. Thus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by 45 governmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other) government budgets. Transportation securities,\nanother component of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have occasional sharp price movements which may\nresult from changes in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and insurance costs. Inflation-Indexed\nSecurities Risk . The principal amount of an inflation-indexed security typically increases with inflation\nand decreases with deflation, as measured by a specified index. It is possible that, in a period of\ndeclining inflation rates, a Fund could receive at maturity less than the initial principal amount of an\ninflation-indexed security. Although the holders of U.S. TIPS receive no less than the par value of the\nsecurity at maturity, if a Fund purchases U.S. TIPS in the secondary market whose principal values have\npreviously been adjusted upward and there is a period of subsequent declining inflation rates, a Fund may\nreceive at maturity less than it invested. Depending on the changes in inflation rates during the period a\nFund holds an inflation-indexed security, a Fund may earn less on the security than on a conventional bond.\nThe principal amounts of inflation-indexed securities are typically only adjusted periodically, and changes\nin the values of the securities may only approximately reflect changes in inflation rates and may occur\nsubstantially after the changes in inflation rates in question occur. Interest Rate Risk . Interest rate\nrisk is the risk that the securities held by a Fund will decline in value because of increases in market\ninterest rates. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in\ninterest rates. Debt securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest\nrates, usually making them more volatile than debt securities with shorter durations. For example, the value\nof a security with a duration of five years would be expected to decrease by 5% for every 1% increase in\ninterest rates. Falling interest rates also create the potential for a decline in a Fund's income and yield.\nInterest-only and principal-only securities are especially sensitive to interest rate changes, which can\naffect not only their prices but can also change the income flows and repayment assumptions about those\ninvestments. Variable and floating rate securities also generally increase or decrease in value in response\nto changes in interest rates, although generally to a lesser degree than fixed-rate securities. A\nsubstantial increase in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on the liquidity of a security,\nespecially those with longer durations. Interest rate changes can be sudden and unpredictable, and are\ninfluenced by a number of factors, including government policy, monetary policy, inflation expectations,\nperceptions of risk, and supply and demand for bonds. Changes in government or central bank policy,\nincluding changes in tax policy or changes in a central bank's implementation of specific policy goals, may\nhave a substantial impact on interest rates. This could lead to heightened levels of interest rate,\nvolatility and liquidity risks for the fixed income markets generally and could have a substantial and\nimmediate effect on the values of a Fund's investments. There can be no guarantee that any particular\ngovernment or central bank policy will be continued, discontinued or changed, nor that any such policy will\nhave the desired effect on interest rates. Leveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions, reverse repurchase\nagreements, certain derivatives transactions, securities lending transactions and other investment\ntransactions such as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward commitment transactions may create investment\nleverage. If a Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund's investment\nportfolio, the value of the Fund will be potentially more volatile and all other risks will tend to be\ncompounded. This is because leverage generally creates investment risk with respect to a larger base of\nassets than a Fund would otherwise have and so magnifies the effect of any increase or decrease in the value\nof the Fund's underlying assets. The use of leverage is considered to be a speculative investment practice\nand may result in losses to a Fund. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of\nthe size of the initial investment. The use of leverage may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may\nnot be advantageous to do so to satisfy repayment, interest payment, or margin obligations or to meet asset\ncoverage requirements. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk that a Fund may not be able to dispose of\ninvestments readily at a favorable time or prices (or at all) or at prices approximating those at which a\nFund currently values them. For example, certain investments may be subject to restrictions on resale, may\ntrade in the over-the-counter market or in limited volume, or may not have an active trading market.\nIlliquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be subject to\nwide fluctuations in market value. It may be difficult for a Fund to value illiquid investments accurately.\nThe market for certain investments may become illiquid under adverse market or economic conditions\nindependent of any specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer. If the liquidity of a\nFund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market price of Fund Shares and the net\nasset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less liquid. Disposal of illiquid\ninvestments may entail 46 registration expenses and other transaction costs that are higher than those for\nliquid investments. A Fund may seek to borrow money to meet its obligations (including among other things\nredemption obligations) if it is unable to dispose of illiquid investments, resulting in borrowing expenses\nand possible leveraging of the Fund. Market Risk . Market prices of investments held by a Fund will go up or\ndown, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. A Fund's investments are subject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile, and prices of investments can change substantially due to various\nfactors, including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers and general market liquidity. Even if general\neconomic conditions do not change, the value of an investment in a Fund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the Fund invests do not perform well or are adversely affected by\nevents. Further, legal, political, regulatory and tax changes also may cause fluctuations in markets and\nsecurities prices. Local, regional or global events such as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism,\nnatural disasters, public health issues, or other events could have a significant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments. Due to the interconnectedness of economies and financial markets throughout the world, if a\nFund invests in securities of issuers located in or with significant exposure to countries experiencing\neconomic and financial difficulties, the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments may be negatively\naffected. A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as COVID-19, and efforts to contain its\nspread, may result in market volatility, inflation, reduced liquidity of certain instruments, disruption in\nthe trading of certain instruments, and systemic economic weakness. The foregoing could impact a Fund and\nits investments and result in disruptions to the services provided to a Fund by its service providers. Non-\nDiversification Risk . Funds classified as \u201c non-diversified \u201d may hold a smaller number of portfolio\nsecurities than many other funds. To the extent a Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a\ndecline in the market value of a particular security held by the Fund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. A non-diversified Fund may become diversified for periods of time solely\nas a result of tracking its Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component securities).\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk . Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers entail risks not typically\nassociated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers. Similar risks may apply to securities traded on a\nU.S. securities exchange that are issued by entities with significant exposure to non-U.S. countries. In\ncertain countries, legal remedies available to investors may be more limited than those available with\nregard to U.S. investments. Because non-U.S. securities are typically denominated and traded in currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar, the value of the Fund's assets, to the extent they are non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated, may be affected favorably or unfavorably by currency exchange rates, exchange control\nregulations, and delays, restrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of non-U.S. currencies. To the\nextent underlying securities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the exchange\non which the Fund's shares trade is open, there may be deviations between the current price of an underlying\nsecurity and the last quoted price for the underlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts greater than those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic securities. Income and gains with respect to investments in certain countries may be\nsubject to withholding and other taxes. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S.\nentity than about a U.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting, auditing, and\nfinancial reporting standards, regulatory framework and practices comparable to those in the United States.\nThe securities of some non-U.S. entities are less liquid and at times more volatile than securities of\ncomparable U.S. entities, and could become subject to sanctions or embargoes that adversely affect a Fund's\ninvestment. Non-U.S. transaction costs, such as brokerage commissions and custody costs may be higher than\nin the U.S. In addition, there may be a possibility of nationalization or expropriation of assets,\nimposition of currency exchange controls, confiscatory taxation, and diplomatic developments that could\nadversely affect the values of a Fund's investments in issuers in certain non-U.S. countries. Investments in\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers also are subject to foreign political and economic risk not associated with\nU.S. investments, meaning that political events (civil unrest, national elections, changes in political\nconditions and foreign relations, imposition of exchange controls and repatriation restrictions), social and\neconomic events (labor strikes, rising inflation) and natural disasters occurring in a country where a Fund\ninvests could cause the Fund's investments to experience gains or losses. 47 Reinvestment Risk. Income from\na Fund's portfolio may decline when the Fund invests the proceeds from investment income, sales of portfolio\nsecurities or matured, traded or called debt obligations. For instance, during periods of declining interest\nrates, an issuer of debt obligations may exercise an option to redeem securities prior to maturity, forcing\na Fund to reinvest the proceeds in lower-yielding securities. A decline in income received by a Fund from\nits investments is likely to have a negative effect on the yield and total return of the Fund Shares.\nRestricted Securities Risk . A Fund may hold securities that have not been registered for sale to the public\nunder the U.S. federal securities laws pursuant to an exemption from registration. These securities may be\nless liquid than securities registered for sale to the general public. The liquidity of a restricted\nsecurity may be affected by a number of factors, including, among others: (i) the creditworthiness of the\nissuer; (ii) the frequency of trades and quotes for the security; (iii) the number of dealers willing to\npurchase or sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers; (iv) dealer undertakings to make\na market in the security; (v) the nature of any legal restrictions governing trading in the security; and\n(vi) the nature of the security and the nature of marketplace trades. There can be no assurance that a\nliquid trading market will exist at any time for any particular restricted security. Also, restricted\nsecurities may be difficult to value because market quotations may not be readily available, and the\nsecurities may have significant volatility. Settlement Risk . Markets in different countries have different\nclearance and settlement procedures and in certain markets there have been times when settlements have been\nunable to keep pace with the volume of transactions. Delays in settlement may increase credit risk to a\nFund, limit the ability of a Fund to reinvest the proceeds of a sale of securities, hinder the ability of a\nFund to lend its portfolio securities, and potentially subject a Fund to penalties for its failure to\ndeliver to on-purchasers of securities whose delivery to a Fund was delayed. Delays in the settlement of\nsecurities purchased by a Fund may limit the ability of a Fund to sell those securities at times and prices\nit considers desirable, and may subject a Fund to losses and costs due to its own inability to settle with\nsubsequent purchasers of the securities from it. A Fund may be required to borrow monies it had otherwise\nexpected to receive in connection with the settlement of securities sold by it, in order to meet its\nobligations to others. Limits on the ability of a Fund to purchase or sell securities due to settlement\ndelays could increase any variance between a Fund's performance and that of its benchmark index. Sovereign\nDebt Obligations Risk . Investments in debt securities issued by governments or by government agencies and\ninstrumentalities involve the risk that the governmental entities responsible for repayment may be unable or\nunwilling to pay interest and repay principal when due. A governmental entity's willingness or ability to\npay interest and repay principal in a timely manner may be affected by a variety of factors, including its\ncash flow, the size of its reserves, its access to foreign exchange, the relative size of its debt service\nburden to its economy as a whole, and political constraints. A governmental entity may default on its\nobligations or may require renegotiation or reschedule of debt payments. Any restructuring of a sovereign\ndebt obligation held by a Fund will likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of the obligation.\nIn the event of default of sovereign debt, the Fund may be unable to pursue legal action against the\nsovereign issuer or to realize on collateral securing the debt. The sovereign debt of certain non-U.S.\ngovernments, including their sub-divisions and instrumentalities, is rated below investment-grade. Sovereign\ndebt risk may be greater for debt securities issued or guaranteed by emerging and/or frontier countries.\nUnconstrained Sector Risk . A Fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time to time. When a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial, economic, business, and other developments affecting issuers in\nthat industry, market, or economic sector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not focused\nits assets in that industry, market, or economic sector, which may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nValuation Risk . Some portfolio holdings, potentially a large portion of a Fund's investment portfolio, may\nbe valued on the basis of factors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are not readily available. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in\ntime might differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using\nmarket quotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations,\nincluding \u201c fair valued \u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were used. Technological issues or other service disruption issues\ninvolving third-party service providers may cause a Fund to value its investments 48 incorrectly. In\naddition, there is no assurance that a Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value\nestablished for it at any time, and it is possible that a Fund would incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by a Fund at that time. Non-\nPrincipal Risks Each risk discussed below is a non-principal risk of a Fund to the extent it is not\nidentified as a principal risk for such Fund in the preceding \u201c ADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION - PRINCIPAL\nRISKS \u201d section. Authorized Participants, Market Makers and Liquidity Providers Concentration Risk. A Fund\nhas a limited number of financial institutions that may act as Authorized Participants ( \u201c APs \u201d ), which\nare responsible for the creation and redemption activity for a Fund. In addition, there may be a limited\nnumber of market makers and/or liquidity providers in the marketplace. To the extent either of the following\nevents occur, Fund Shares may trade at a material discount to NAV and possibly face delisting: (i) APs exit\nthe business or otherwise become unable to process creation and/or redemption orders and no other APs step\nforward to perform these services, or (ii) market makers and/or liquidity providers exit the business or\nsignificantly reduce their business activities and no other entities step forward to perform their\nfunctions. Cash Transaction Risk . To the extent a Fund sells portfolio securities to meet some or all of a\nredemption request with cash, the Fund may incur taxable gains or losses that it might not have incurred had\nit made redemptions entirely in-kind. As a result, a Fund may pay out higher annual capital gain\ndistributions than if the in-kind redemption process was used. Concentration Risk. A Fund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of industries, but only to the extent that the Fund's underlying Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of industries. When a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial, economic, business, and other developments affecting issuers in\nthat industry, market, or economic sector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not focused\nits assets in that industry, market, or economic sector, which may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nConflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a Fund will be subject to a number of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest. For example, the Adviser or its affiliates may provide services to a Fund, such as\nsecurities lending agency services, custodial, administrative, bookkeeping, and accounting services,\ntransfer agency and shareholder servicing, securities brokerage services, and other services for which the\nFund would compensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates. The Funds may invest in other pooled investment\nvehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise affiliated with the Adviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its affiliates, or the terms on which it enters into\ntransactions with the Adviser or its affiliates will be the most favorable available in the market generally\nor as favorable as the rates the Adviser or its affiliates make available to other clients. Because of its\nfinancial interest, the Adviser will have an incentive to enter into transactions or arrangements on behalf\nof a Fund with itself or its affiliates in circumstances where it might not have done so in the absence of\nthat interest, provided that the Adviser will comply with applicable regulatory requirements. The Adviser\nand its affiliates serve as investment adviser to other clients and may make investment decisions that may\nbe different from those that will be made by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds. For example, the Adviser\nmay provide asset allocation advice to some clients that may include a recommendation to invest in or redeem\nfrom particular issuers while not providing that same recommendation to all clients invested in the same or\nsimilar issuers. The Adviser may (subject to applicable law) be simultaneously seeking to purchase (or sell)\ninvestments for a Fund and to sell (or purchase) the same investment for accounts, funds, or structured\nproducts for which it serves as asset manager, or for other clients or affiliates. The Adviser and its\naffiliates may invest for clients in various securities that are senior, pari passu or junior to, or have\ninterests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by a Fund. The Adviser or its\naffiliates, in connection with its other business activities, may acquire material nonpublic confidential\ninformation that may restrict the Adviser from purchasing securities or selling securities for itself or its\nclients (including the Funds) or otherwise using such information for the benefit of its clients or itself.\nThe foregoing does not purport to be a comprehensive list or complete explanation of all potential conflicts\nof interests which may affect a Fund. A Fund may encounter circumstances, or enter into transactions, in\nwhich conflicts of interest that are not listed or discussed above may arise. 49 Costs of Buying and Selling\nShares . Investors buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or\nother charges imposed by brokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed\namount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small\namounts of Fund Shares. In addition, secondary market investors will also incur the cost of the difference\nbetween the price that an investor is willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201c bid \u201d price) and the price at\nwhich an investor is willing to sell Fund Shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price). This difference in bid and ask prices\nis often referred to as the \u201c spread \u201d or \u201c bid/ask spread. \u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time for Fund\nShares based on trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if Fund Shares have more trading\nvolume and market liquidity and higher if Fund Shares have little trading volume and market liquidity.\nFurther, increased market volatility may cause increased bid/ask spreads. Due to the costs of buying or\nselling Fund Shares, including bid/ask spreads, frequent trading of Fund Shares may significantly reduce\ninvestment results and an investment in Fund Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate\nregularly making small investments. Cybersecurity Risk . With the increased use of technologies such as the\nInternet and the dependence on computer systems to perform business and operational functions, funds (such\nas the Funds) and their service providers (including the Adviser) may be prone to operational and\ninformation security risks resulting from cyber-attacks and/or technological malfunctions. Furthermore,\ngeopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and sophistication of deliberate cybersecurity attacks,\nparticularly those from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing. In general, cyber-attacks\nare deliberate, but unintentional events may have similar effects. Cyber-attacks include, among others,\nstealing or corrupting data maintained online or digitally, preventing legitimate users from accessing\ninformation or services on a website, releasing confidential information without authorization, and causing\noperational disruption. Successful cyber-attacks against, or security breakdowns of, a Fund, the Adviser, or\na custodian, transfer agent, or other affiliated or third-party service provider may adversely affect a Fund\nor its shareholders. For instance, cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may interfere with the processing\nof shareholder or other transactions, affect a Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the release of\nprivate shareholder information or confidential Fund information, impede trading, cause reputational damage,\nand subject a Fund to regulatory fines, penalties or financial losses, reimbursement or other compensation\ncosts, and additional compliance costs. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may render records of Fund\nassets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and other data integral to the functioning of\na Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. A Fund may also incur substantial costs for cybersecurity\nrisk management in order to prevent cyber incidents in the future. A Fund and its shareholders could be\nnegatively impacted as a result. While the Adviser has established business continuity plans and systems\ndesigned to minimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the use of technology, processes and controls, there\nare inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not\nbeen identified, given the evolving nature of this threat. Each Fund relies on third-party service providers\nfor many of its day-to-day operations, and will be subject to the risk that the protections and protocols\nimplemented by those service providers will be ineffective to protect the Fund from cyber-attack. The\nAdviser does not control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by third-party service providers,\nand such third-party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Adviser or the\nFunds. Similar types of cybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions also are present for issuers of\nsecurities in which each Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers,\nand may cause a Fund's investment in such securities to lose value. Index Construction Risk . A security\nincluded in an Index may not exhibit the characteristic or provide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently a Fund's holdings may not exhibit returns consistent with that characteristic or\nexposure. Index Licensing Risk . It is possible that the license under which the Adviser or a Fund is\npermitted to replicate or otherwise use an Index will be terminated or may be disputed, impaired or cease to\nremain in effect. In such a case, the Adviser may be required to replace the relevant Index with another\nindex which it considers to be appropriate in light of the investment strategy of a Fund. The use of any\nsuch substitute index may have an adverse impact on a Fund's performance. In the event that the Adviser is\nunable to identify a suitable replacement for the relevant Index, it may determine to terminate a Fund.\nMoney Market Fund Investment Risk . An investment in a money market fund is not a deposit of any bank and is\nnot insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Certain money market funds seek to\npreserve the value of their shares at $1.00 per share, although there can be no assurance that they will do\nso, and it is possible to lose money by investing in such a money market fund. A major or unexpected change\nin interest rates or a decline in 50 the credit quality of an issuer or entity providing credit support, an\ninactive trading market for money market instruments, or adverse market, economic, industry, political,\nregulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions could cause the share price of such a money market fund to\nfall below $1.00. It is possible that such a money market fund will issue and redeem shares at $1.00 per\nshare at times when the fair value of the money market fund's portfolio per share is more or less than\n$1.00. None of State Street Corporation, State Street, State Street Global Advisors ( \u201c SSGA \u201d ), SSGA FM or\ntheir affiliates (the \u201c State Street Entities \u201d ) guarantee the value of an investment in a money market\nfund at $1.00 per share. Investors should have no expectation of capital support to a money market fund from\nState Street Entities. Other money market funds price and transact at a \u201c floating \u201d NAV that will fluctuate\nalong with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Shares sold utilizing a floating NAV may be\nworth more or less than their original purchase price. Recent changes in the regulation of money market\nfunds may affect the operations and structures of money market funds. A money market fund may be permitted\nor required to impose redemption fees during times of market stress. Portfolio Turnover Risk . A Fund may\nengage in frequent trading of its portfolio securities. Fund turnover generally involves a number of direct\nand indirect costs and expenses to a Fund, including, for example, brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups\nand bid/asked spreads, and transaction costs on the sale of securities and reinvestment in other securities.\nThe costs related to increased portfolio turnover have the effect of reducing a Fund's investment return,\nand the sale of securities by the Fund may result in the realization of taxable capital gains, including\nshort-term capital gains. A Fund may engage in significant trading of its portfolio securities in connection\nwith Index rebalancing. Frequent or significant trading may cause a Fund to incur additional transaction\ncosts and experience different tax consequences in comparison to an ETF that does not engage in frequent or\nsignificant trading. Regulatory Risk. Governmental and regulatory actions may have unexpected or adverse\nconsequences on particular markets, strategies, or investments, which may adversely impact a Fund and impair\nhow it is managed. Policy and legislative changes in the United States and in other countries may affect\naspects of financial regulation, and may in some instances contribute to decreased liquidity and increased\nvolatility in the financial markets. The impact of these changes on the markets, and the practical\nimplications for market participants, may not be fully known for some time. Securities Lending Risk. Each\nFund may lend portfolio securities in an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For these\npurposes, net assets shall exclude the value of all assets received as collateral for the loan. Such loans\nmay be terminated at any time. Any such loans must be continuously secured by collateral maintained on a\ncurrent basis in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned by a Fund, marked to\nmarket each trading day. A Fund will receive the amount of all dividends, interest and other distributions\non the loaned securities; however, the borrower has the right to vote the loaned securities. A Fund will\ncall loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the investment is to be voted upon. Efforts to\nrecall such securities promptly may be unsuccessful, especially for foreign securities or thinly traded\nsecurities. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. Should the borrower of the\nsecurities fail financially, a Fund may experience delays in recovering the securities or exercising its\nrights in the collateral. Loans are made only to borrowers that are deemed by the securities lending agent\nto be of good financial standing. In a loan transaction, a Fund will also bear the risk of any decline in\nvalue of securities provided as collateral or acquired with cash collateral. Each Fund will attempt to\nminimize this risk by limiting the investment of cash collateral to high quality instruments of short\nmaturity either directly on behalf of the lending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or funds, which\nmay include those managed by the Adviser. To the extent the collateral provided or investments made with\ncash collateral differ from securities included in an Index, such collateral or investments may have a\ngreater risk of loss than the securities included in the Index. In addition, a Fund will be subject to the\nrisk that any income generated by lending its securities or reinvesting cash collateral is lower than any\nfees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower. The Adviser will take into account the tax impact to\nshareholders of substitute payments for dividends when overseeing a Fund's securities lending activity.\nTrading Issues . Although Fund Shares are listed for trading on the Exchange and may be listed or traded on\nU.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the Exchange, there can be no assurance that an active trading\nmarket for such Fund Shares will develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund Shares on the Exchange may be\nhalted due to market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in Fund\nShares inadvisable. In addition, trading in Fund Shares on the Exchange is subject to trading halts caused\nby extraordinary market volatility pursuant to Exchange \u201c circuit breaker \u201d rules. Similar to the shares of\noperating companies listed on a stock exchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and are therefore subject to\nthe risk of increased volatility in the trading price of the Fund's 51 shares. While each Fund expects that\nthe ability of Authorized Participants to create and redeem Fund Shares at net asset value should be\neffective in reducing any such volatility, there is no guarantee that it will eliminate the volatility\nassociated with such short sales. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary\nto maintain the listing of a Fund will continue to be met or will remain unchanged or that Fund Shares will\ntrade with any volume, or at all, on any stock exchange. 52\n\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to each Fund and, subject to the\noversight of the Board, is responsible for the investment management of each Fund. The Adviser provides an\ninvestment management program for each Fund and manages the investment of each Fund's assets. In addition,\nthe Adviser provides administrative, compliance and general management services to each Fund. The Adviser is\na wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Global Advisors, Inc., which itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary\nof State Street Corporation. The Adviser is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940, as amended. The Adviser and certain other affiliates of State Street Corporation make up SSGA. SSGA is\none of the world's largest institutional money managers and the investment management arm of State Street\nCorporation. As of December 31, 2023, the Adviser managed approximately $955.79 billion in assets and SSGA\nmanaged approximately $4.13 trillion in assets. The Adviser's principal business address is One Iron Street,\nBoston, Massachusetts 02210. For the services provided to each Fund under the Investment Advisory Agreement,\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, each Fund paid the Adviser the annual fees based on a\npercentage of each Fund's average daily net assets as set forth below:\n                                                           \n  SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF    0.30%  \n  SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF   0.50%  \n  SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF    0.35%  \n  SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury  0.35%  \n  Bond ETF                                                 \n  SPDR FTSE International Government                0.50%  \n  Inflation-Protected Bond ETF                             \n                                                           \nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all or a portion of its management fee. The Adviser has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse expenses in an amount equal\nto any acquired fund fees and expenses (excluding holdings in acquired funds for cash management purposes,\nif any) for each Fund until April 30, 2025. This waiver and/or reimbursement does not provide for the\nrecoupment by the Adviser of any amounts waived or reimbursed. This waiver and/or reimbursement may not be\nterminated prior to April 30, 2025 except with the approval of the Board. The Adviser pays all expenses of\neach Fund other than the management fee, brokerage expenses, taxes, interest, fees and expenses of the\nIndependent Trustees (including any Trustee's counsel fees), litigation expenses, acquired fund fees and\nexpenses and other extraordinary expenses. Participating Affiliates. The Adviser has entered into personnel-\nsharing arrangements with each of SSGA LTD and SSGA Singapore, each an affiliate of the Adviser. SSGA LTD is\nan indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Global Advisors, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA, Inc. \u201d ) and SSGA\nSingapore is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of SSGA, Inc. SSGA, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State\nStreet Corporation. Pursuant to the personnel-sharing arrangements, certain employees of SSGA LTD and SSGA\nSingapore, as \u201c participating affiliates, \u201d serve as \u201c associated persons \u201d of the Adviser, and, in this\ncapacity, are subject to the oversight of the Adviser and its Chief Compliance Officer. These associated\npersons may, on behalf of the Adviser, provide discretionary investment management services (including\nportfolio management and trading services), research and related services to the applicable Fund(s) in\naccordance with the investment objectives, policies and limitations set forth in the prospectus and SAI.\nSSGA LTD provides such services to the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF and the SPDR Bloomberg\nInternational Corporate Bond ETF. SSGA Singapore provides such services to the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging\nMarkets Local Bond ETF. Unlike the Adviser, neither SSGA LTD nor SSGA Singapore is registered as an\ninvestment adviser with the SEC. Each personnel-sharing arrangement is based on no-action letters of the\nstaff of the SEC that permit SEC-registered investment advisers to rely on and use the resources of advisory\naffiliates, subject to certain conditions. Prior to March 31, 2023, SSGA LTD was a registered investment\nadviser with the SEC, and provided investment sub-advisory services to the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets\nLocal Bond ETF and SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF. As of December 31, 2023, SSGA LTD\nmanaged approximately $428.78 billion in assets. SSGA LTD's principal business address is 20 Churchill\nPlace, Canary Wharf, London E14 5HJ, United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2023, SSGA Singapore managed\napproximately $3.97 billion in assets. SSGA Singapore's principal business address is 168 Robinson Road,\n#33-01 Capital Tower, Singapore 068912. A discussion regarding the Board's consideration of the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement is provided in the Funds' Semi-Annual Report to Shareholders for the period ended June\n30, 2023.\n\n53\n\nSSGA FM, as the investment adviser for the Funds, may hire one or more sub-advisers to oversee the day-to-\nday investment activities of the Funds. The sub-advisers are subject to oversight by the Adviser. The\nAdviser and SPDR Series Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits\nthe Adviser, with the approval of the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, of the Trust,\nto retain and amend existing sub-advisory agreements with unaffiliated investment sub-advisers for a Fund\nwithout submitting the sub-advisory agreement to a vote of the Fund's shareholders. The Trust will notify\nshareholders in the event of any change in the identity of such sub-adviser or sub-advisers. The Adviser has\nultimate responsibility for the investment performance of the Funds due to its responsibility to oversee\neach sub-adviser and recommend their hiring, termination and replacement. The Adviser is not required to\ndisclose fees paid to any unaffiliated sub-adviser retained pursuant to the order. Approval by a Fund's\nshareholders is required before any authority granted under the exemptive order may be exercised. Portfolio\nManagers.\nThe Adviser manages the Funds using a team of investment professionals. The team approach is used to create\nan environment that encourages the flow of investment ideas. The portfolio managers within each team work\ntogether in a cohesive manner to develop and enhance techniques that drive the investment process for the\nrespective investment strategy. This approach requires portfolio managers to share a variety of\nresponsibilities, including investment strategy and analysis, while retaining responsibility for the\nimplementation of the strategy within any particular portfolio. The approach also enables the team to draw\nupon the resources of other groups within SSGA. Each portfolio management team is overseen by the SSGA\nInvestment Committee. The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of each Fund\nare:\n                                                                                                            \n  Portfolio Managers                  Fund                                                                  \n  Catherine Pointon, Robert Golcher,  SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF                        \n  KhengSiang Ng and Imran Khan                                                                              \n  Richard Darby-Dowman, Paul Brown,   SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF                       \n  PavelKhimchuk and Peter Spano                                                                             \n  James Kramer, Joanna Madden and     SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg Short  \n  CynthiaMoy                          Term International Treasury Bond ETF, SPDR FTSE                       \n                                      InternationalGovernment Inflation-Protected Bond ETF                  \n                                                                                                            \nPaul Brown is a Vice President and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Team at\nSSGA LTD, having joined the company in 2013.

The secondary markets are closed on weekends and also are generally closed\non the following holidays: New Year's Day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday,\nMemorial Day (observed), Juneteenth National Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day\nand Christmas Day. The Exchange may close early on the business day before certain holidays and on the day\nafter Thanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules are subject to change without notice. If you buy or sell\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you will pay the secondary market price for Fund Shares. In addition,\nyou may incur customary brokerage commissions and charges and may pay some or all of the spread between the\nbid and the offered price in the secondary market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale)\ntransaction. The trading prices of Fund Shares will fluctuate continuously throughout trading hours based on\nmarket supply and demand rather than the relevant Fund's net asset value, which is calculated for each Fund\nonce daily as of the close of the regular trading session on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on\neach day that such exchange is open. Fund Shares will trade on the Exchange at prices that may be above (\ni.e ., at a premium) or below ( i.e ., at a discount), to varying degrees, the calculated net asset value of\nFund Shares. The trading prices of Fund Shares may deviate significantly from the relevant Fund's net asset\nvalue during periods of market volatility. Given, however, that Fund Shares can be issued and redeemed daily\nin Creation Units, the Adviser believes that large discounts and premiums to net asset value should not be\nsustained over long periods. The Exchange will disseminate, every fifteen seconds during the regular trading\nday, an indicative optimized portfolio value ( \u201c IOPV \u201d ) relating to each Fund. The IOPV calculations are\nestimates of the value of each Fund's net asset value per Fund Share. Premiums and discounts between the\nIOPV and the market price may occur. This should not be viewed as a \u201c real-time \u201d update of the net asset\nvalue per Fund Share. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the published basket of portfolio\nsecurities and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit and does not necessarily\nreflect the precise composition of a Fund's actual portfolio at a particular point in time. Moreover, the\nIOPV is generally determined by using current market quotations and/or price quotations obtained from\nbroker-dealers and other market intermediaries and valuations based on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the NAV, which (i) is computed only once a day, (ii) unlike the\ncalculation of the IOPV, takes into account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be subject, in accordance with the\nrequirements of the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at different prices than those used in the calculations of\nthe IOPV. The IOPV price is based on quotes and closing prices from the securities' local market converted\ninto U.S. dollars at the current currency rates and may not reflect events that occur subsequent to the\nlocal market's close. Therefore, the IOPV may not reflect the best possible valuation of a Fund's current\nportfolio. Neither the Funds nor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for,\nthe calculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and make no warranty as to their accuracy. The Funds do not\nimpose any restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions; however, the Funds reserve the right\nto reject or limit purchases at any time as described in the SAI. When considering that no restriction or\npolicy was necessary, the Board evaluated the risks posed by market timing activities, such as whether\nfrequent purchases and redemptions would interfere with the efficient implementation of a Fund's investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause a Fund to experience increased transaction costs. The Board considered\nthat, unlike traditional mutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and redeemed only in large quantities of\nshares known as Creation Units, available only from a Fund directly, and that most trading in a Fund occurs\non the Exchange at prevailing market prices and does not involve the Fund directly. Given this structure,\nthe Board determined that it is unlikely that (a) market timing would be attempted by a Fund's shareholders\nor (b) any attempts to market time a Fund by shareholders would result in negative impact to the Fund or its\nshareholders. Distributions Dividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund shareholder, you are entitled to your\nshare of the applicable Fund's income and net realized gains on its investments. Each Fund pays out\nsubstantially all of its net earnings to its shareholders as \u201c distributions. \u201d 58 Each Fund may earn\ninterest from debt securities and, if participating, securities lending income. Each Fund will generally\nrealize short-term capital gains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges assets held for one year or less.\nNet short-term capital gains will generally be treated as ordinary income when distributed to shareholders.\nEach Fund will generally realize long-term capital gains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges assets\nheld for more than one year. Net capital gains (the excess of a Fund's net long-term capital gains over its\nnet short-term capital losses) are distributed to shareholders as \u201c capital gain distributions. \u201d Income\ndividend distributions, if any, are generally distributed to shareholders monthly, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Net capital gains for each Fund are distributed at least annually.\nDividends may be declared and paid more frequently or at any other time to improve Index tracking or to\ncomply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c Code \u201d ).\nA portion of each distribution may result in a return of capital. You will be notified regarding the portion\nof the distribution which represents a return of capital. Distributions in cash may be reinvested\nautomatically in additional whole Fund Shares only if the broker through whom you purchased Fund Shares\nmakes such option available. Distributions which are reinvested will nevertheless be taxable to the same\nextent as if such distributions had not been reinvested. Portfolio Holdings Disclosure The Funds' portfolio\nholdings disclosure policy is described in the SAI. In addition, the identities and quantities of the\nsecurities held by each Fund are disclosed on the Funds' website. Additional Tax Information The following\ndiscussion is a summary of some important U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in a Fund. Your investment in a Fund may have other tax implications. Please consult your tax\nadvisor about federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws applicable to you. Investors, including\nnon-U.S. investors, may wish to consult the SAI tax section for additional disclosure. Taxes On\nDistributions. In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether\nyou take them in cash or reinvest them in a Fund. The income dividends and short-term capital gains\ndistributions you receive from the Funds will generally be taxed as ordinary income. Any distributions of a\nFund's net capital gains are taxable as long-term capital gain regardless of how long you have owned Fund\nShares. Long-term capital gains are generally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates.\nDistributions in excess of a Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free\nreturn of capital to the extent of your basis in the Fund's shares, and, in general, as capital gain\nthereafter. Since the Funds primarily hold investments that do not pay dividends, it is not expected that a\nsubstantial portion (if any) of the dividends paid by a Fund will qualify for either the dividends-received\ndeduction for corporations or the favorable income tax rates available to individuals on qualified dividend\nincome. U.S. individuals with income exceeding specified thresholds are subject to a 3.8% Medicare\ncontribution tax on all or a portion of their \u201c net investment income, \u201d which includes taxable interest,\ndividends and certain capital gains (generally including capital gain distributions and capital gains\nrealized upon the sale of Fund Shares). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of the undistributed\nnet investment income of certain shareholders that are estates and trusts. Certain tax-exempt educational\ninstitutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on net investment income. For these purposes, certain dividends\nand capital gain distributions, and certain gains from the disposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken into account in computing a shareholder's net investment income.\nDistributions paid in January, but declared by a Fund in October, November or December of the previous year,\npayable to shareholders of record in such a month, may be taxable to you in the calendar year in which they\nwere declared. The Funds will inform you of the amount of your ordinary income dividends and capital gain\ndistributions shortly after the close of each calendar year. A distribution will reduce a Fund's net asset\nvalue per Fund Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an\ninvestment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 59 Original Issue Discount .\nInvestments by a Fund in zero coupon or other discount securities will result in income to the Fund equal to\na portion of the excess face value of the securities over their issue price (the \u201c original issue discount \u201d\nor \u201c OID \u201d ) each year that the securities are held, even though the Fund may receive no cash interest\npayments or may receive cash interest payments that are less than the income recognized for tax purposes. In\nother circumstances, whether pursuant to the terms of a security or as a result of other factors outside the\ncontrol of a Fund, a Fund may recognize income without receiving a commensurate amount of cash. A Fund's\nshare of such income is included in determining the amount that the Fund must distribute to maintain its\neligibility for treatment as a regulated investment company and to avoid the payment of federal tax,\nincluding the nondeductible 4% excise tax. Because any income required to be recognized as a result of the\nOID and/or market discount rules (discussed below) may not be matched by a corresponding cash payment, the\nFund may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to be able to make distributions to its\nshareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company and eliminate taxes at the\nFund level. Inflation-Indexed Bonds. Special rules apply if a Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds. Generally,\nall stated interest on inflation-indexed bonds is taken into income by a Fund under its regular method of\naccounting for interest income. The amount of any positive inflation adjustment for a taxable year, which\nresults from an increase in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is treated as OID. The\namount of a Fund's OID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will increase the Fund's taxable income for\nsuch year without a corresponding receipt of cash until the bond matures. As a result, a Fund may need to\nuse other sources of cash to satisfy its distribution requirements for such year. The amount of any negative\ninflation adjustments, which result from a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond,\nfirst reduces the amount of interest (including stated interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise\nincludible in a Fund's income with respect to the bond for the taxable year; any remaining negative\nadjustments will be either treated as ordinary loss or, in certain circumstances, carried forward to reduce\nthe amount of interest income taken into account with respect to the bond in future taxable years. Market\nDiscount. Any market discount recognized on a market discount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market\ndiscount bond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or below adjusted\nissue price if the bond was issued with original issue discount. Absent an election by a Fund to include the\nmarket discount in income as it accrues, the gain on the Fund's disposition of such an obligation will be\ntreated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount. Where the\nincome required to be recognized as a result of the market discount rules is not matched by a corresponding\ncash receipt by the Fund, the Fund may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to enable the\nFund to make distributions to its shareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment\ncompany and eliminate taxes at the Fund level, potentially resulting in additional taxable gain or loss to\nthe Fund. Derivatives and Other Complex Securities. A Fund may invest in complex securities. These\ninvestments may be subject to numerous special and complex rules. These rules could affect whether gains and\nlosses recognized by a Fund are treated as ordinary income or capital gain, accelerate the recognition of\nincome to a Fund and/or defer a Fund's ability to recognize losses. In turn, these rules may affect the\namount, timing or character of the income distributed to you by a Fund. You should consult your personal tax\nadvisor regarding the application of these rules. Foreign Currency Transactions. A Fund's transactions in\nforeign currencies, foreign currency denominated debt obligations and certain foreign currency options,\nfutures contracts and forward contracts (and similar instruments) may give rise to ordinary income or loss\nto the extent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency concerned.\nForeign Income Taxes. Investment income received by a Fund from sources within foreign countries may be\nsubject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. The United States has entered into tax treaties with\nmany foreign countries which may entitle a Fund to a reduced rate of such taxes or exemption from taxes on\nsuch income. It is impossible to determine the effective rate of foreign tax for a Fund in advance since the\namount of the assets to be invested within various countries is not known. If more than 50% of the total\nassets of a Fund at the close of its taxable year consist of certain foreign stocks or securities, the Fund\nmay elect to \u201c pass through \u201d to you certain foreign income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the\nFund. If a Fund in which you hold Fund Shares makes such an election, you will be considered to have\nreceived as an additional dividend your share of such foreign taxes, but you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit\nin calculating your federal income tax. No deduction for such taxes will be permitted to individuals 60 in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax liability. If a Fund does not so elect, the Fund will be entitled to\nclaim a deduction for certain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund. Under certain circumstances, if a Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign taxes paid in respect of a prior year, the value of Fund Shares could be\naffected or any foreign tax credits or deductions passed through to shareholders in respect of the Fund's\nforeign taxes for the current year could be reduced. Taxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any capital gain\nor loss realized upon a sale of Fund Shares is generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if Fund\nShares have been held for more than one year and as short-term capital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for one year or less, except that any capital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held for six months or\nless is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect\nto such Fund Shares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units. A person who exchanges securities\nfor Creation Units generally will recognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss will be equal to the difference\nbetween the market value of the Creation Units at the time and the exchanger's aggregate basis in the\nsecurities surrendered plus any cash paid for the Creation Units. A person who exchanges Creation Units for\nsecurities will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the exchanger's basis in\nthe Creation Units and the aggregate market value of the securities and the amount of cash received. The\nIRS, however, may assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of securities for Creation Units cannot be\ndeducted currently under the rules governing \u201c wash sales, \u201d or on the basis that there has been no\nsignificant change in economic position. Persons exchanging securities should consult their own tax advisor\nwith respect to whether wash sale rules apply and when a loss might be deductible. Under current federal tax\nlaws, any capital gain or loss realized upon a redemption (or creation) of Creation Units is generally\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or securities surrendered) have\nbeen held for more than one year and as a short-term capital gain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for one year or less. If you create or redeem Creation Units, you\nwill be sent a confirmation statement showing how many Fund Shares you purchased or sold and at what price.\nThe Trust on behalf of each Fund has the right to reject an order for Creation Units if the purchaser (or a\ngroup of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding\nshares of the applicable Fund and if, pursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the applicable Fund would have a\nbasis in the securities different from the market value of the securities on the date of deposit. The Trust\nalso has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of\nthe 80% determination. If the Trust does issue Creation Units to a purchaser (or a group of purchasers) that\nwould, upon obtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the\napplicable Fund, the purchaser (or group of purchasers) will not recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units. If a Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear additional costs and\nrecognize more capital gains than it would if it redeems Creation Units in-kind. Non-U.S. Investors.\nOrdinary income dividends paid by a Fund to shareholders who are non-resident aliens or foreign entities\nwill generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (other than distributions reported by the Fund as\ninterest-related dividends and short-term capital gain dividends), unless a lower treaty rate applies or\nunless such income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. In general, a Fund may report\ninterest-related dividends to the extent of its net income derived from U.S. source interest and a Fund may\nreport short-term capital gain dividends to the extent its net short-term capital gain for the taxable year\nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains on the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that are, in each\ncase, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. will generally be\nsubject to U.S. federal net income taxation at regular income tax rates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of a Fund's shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning special tax rules that may apply to their investment. 61 Unless certain non-U.S. entities that\nhold Fund Shares comply with IRS requirements that will generally require them to report information\nregarding U.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts with, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply to distributions payable to such entities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the withholding\ndescribed in this paragraph under an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and a foreign\ngovernment, provided that the shareholder and the applicable foreign government comply with the terms of\nsuch agreement. Backup Withholding. A Fund will be required in certain cases to withhold (as \u201c backup\nwithholding \u201d ) on amounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund either an incorrect tax\nidentification number or no number at all, (2) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for failure to\nproperly report payments of interest or dividends, (3) has failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup withholding, or (4) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S.\nperson (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently 24%. Backup withholding\nwill not be applied to payments that have been subject to the 30% withholding tax on shareholders who are\nneither citizens nor permanent residents of the United States. Other Tax Issues. A Fund may be subject to\ntax in certain states where the Fund does business (or is treated as doing business as a result of its\ninvestments). Furthermore, in those states which have income tax laws, the tax treatment of the Funds and of\nFund shareholders with respect to distributions by the Funds may differ from federal tax treatment. The\nforegoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current federal income tax law of an\ninvestment in the Funds. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. Consult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax consequences of an investment in the Funds under all applicable tax laws. General\nInformation The Trust was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998. If shareholders of\nany Fund are required to vote on any matters, shareholders are entitled to one vote for each Fund Share they\nown. Annual meetings of shareholders will not be held except as required by the 1940 Act and other\napplicable law. See the SAI for more information concerning the Trust's form of organization. Management and\nOrganization Each Fund is a separate series of the Trust, which is an open-end registered management\ninvestment company. From time to time, a Fund may advertise yield and total return figures. Yield is a\nhistorical measure of dividend income, and total return is a measure of past dividend income (assuming that\nit has been reinvested) plus capital appreciation. Neither yield nor total return should be used to predict\nthe future performance of a Fund. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel to the Trust, including the\nFunds. Ernst & Young LLP serves as the independent registered public accounting firm and will audit the\nFunds' financial statements annually. Financial Highlights These financial highlight tables are intended to\nhelp you understand each Fund's financial performance for the past four fiscal years ended December 31, the\nsix-month period ended December 31, 2019 and the prior fiscal year ended June 30. Certain information\nreflects the performance results for a single Fund Share. The total returns in the table represent the rate\nthat an investor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in each Fund (assuming reinvestment of all\ndividends and distributions). This information has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the Trust's\nindependent registered public accounting firm, whose report, along with each Fund's financial highlights and\nfinancial statements, is included in the annual report to shareholders, which is available upon request. Any\nreferences to Notes in these financial highlight tables refer to the \u201c Notes to Financial Statements \u201d\nsection of each Fund's financial statements, and the financial information included in these tables should\nbe read in conjunction with the financial statements incorporated by reference in the SAI. 62\n\nSPDR SERIES TRUST FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Selected data for a share

purchase of shares at net asset value on the first day and a   \n       sale at net asset value on the last day of each periodreported. Distributions are assumed, for the   \n  (d)  purpose of this calculation, to be reinvested at net asset value per share on the respective         \n       payment dates ofeach distribution. Total returns for periods of less than one year are not           \n       annualized.

                   \n       Amounts shown in this caption for a share outstanding may not accord with the change in aggregate    \n  (c)  gains and losses in securities for the fiscal periodbecause of

on the last day of each periodreported. Distributions are assumed, for the   \n  (e)  purpose of this calculation, to be reinvested at net asset value per share on the respective         \n       payment dates ofeach distribution. Total returns for periods of less than one year are not           \n       annualized. Broker commission charges are not included in this calculation.                          \n  (f)  If an affiliate had not made a contribution during the year ended December 31, 2020, the total       \n       return would have remained 9.73%.                                                                    \n  (g)  Annualized.

The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998 and consists of multiple investment series, including the SPDR\nBloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg\nInternational Treasury Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE\nInternational Government Inflation-Protected Bond ETF (each, a \u201c Fund \u201d and, collectively, the \u201c Funds \u201d ).\nThe table below provides the establishment date for each Fund.\n                                                                        \n  Fund Name                                         Establishment Date  \n  SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF    May 29, 2008        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF   November 17, 2009   \n  SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF    May 31, 2007        \n  SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury  November 28, 2007   \n  BondETF                                                               \n  SPDR FTSE International Government                August 22, 2007     \n  Inflation-ProtectedBond ETF                                           \n                                                                        \nThe offering of each Fund's shares ( \u201c Shares \u201d ) is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended\n(the \u201c Securities Act \u201d ). The investment objective of each Fund is to provide investment results that,\nbefore fees and expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of a specified market\nindex (each an \u201c Index \u201d and together the \u201c Indexes \u201d ). SSGA Funds Management, Inc. serves as the\ninvestment adviser for each Fund ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ). Each Fund offers and issues Shares at\ntheir net asset value (sometimes referred to herein as \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in aggregations of a specified number\nof Shares (each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ). Each Fund generally offers and issues Shares in exchange for (i) a\nbasket of securities designated by the Fund ( \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d ) together with the deposit of a\nspecified cash payment ( \u201c Cash Component \u201d ) or (ii) a cash payment equal in value to the Deposit\nSecurities ( \u201c Deposit Cash \u201d ) together with the Cash Component. The primary consideration accepted by a\nFund (i.e., Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash) is set forth under \u201c Purchase and Redemption of Creation\nUnits \u201d later in this SAI. The Trust reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of a \u201c cash in\nlieu \u201d amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of Deposit Cash (subject to applicable\nlegal requirements). The Shares have been approved for listing and secondary trading on a national\nsecurities exchange (the \u201c Exchange \u201d ). The Shares will trade on the Exchange at market prices. These\nprices may differ from the Shares' net asset values. The Shares are also redeemable only in Creation Unit\naggregations, and generally in exchange for either (i) portfolio securities and a specified cash payment or\n(ii) cash (subject to applicable legal requirements). Shares may be issued in advance of receipt of Deposit\nSecurities subject to various conditions including a requirement to maintain on deposit with the Trust cash\nat least equal to a specified percentage of the market value of the missing Deposit Securities as set forth\nin the Participant Agreement (as defined below). See \u201c Purchase and Redemption of Creation Units. \u201d The\nTrust may impose a transaction fee for each creation or redemption. In all cases, such fees will be limited\nin accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( \u201c SEC \u201d ) applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering redeemable securities. In addition to the fixed creation or\nredemption transaction fee, an additional transaction fee of up to three times the fixed creation or\nredemption transaction fee and/or an additional variable charge may apply. Investment Policies Each Fund may\ninvest in the following types of investments, consistent with its investment strategies and objective.\nPlease see the Funds' Prospectus for additional information regarding its principal investment strategies.\nDIVERSIFICATION STATUS The SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg International\nTreasury Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International\nGovernment Inflation-Protected Bond ETF are each classified as a \u201c non-diversified \u201d investment company, and\nthe SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF is classified as a \u201c diversified \u201d investment company,\nunder the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, a\n\n3\n\ndiversified investment company, as to 75% of its total assets, may not purchase securities of any issuer\n(other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agents or instrumentalities or\nsecurities of other investment companies) if, as a result, more than 5% of its total assets would be\ninvested in the securities of such issuer, or more than 10% of the issuer's outstanding voting securities\nwould be held by the investment company. A \u201c non-diversified \u201d classification means that a Fund is not\nlimited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities\nof a single issuer. This means that a non-diversified Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the\nsecurities of a single issuer than a diversified fund. The securities of a particular issuer may constitute\na greater portion of an Index of a Fund and, therefore, the securities may constitute a greater portion of\nthe Fund's portfolio. This may have an adverse effect on the Fund's performance or subject the Fund's Shares\nto greater price volatility than more diversified investment companies. Each Fund (whether diversified or\nnon-diversified for purposes of the 1940 Act) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and\notherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a \u201c regulated investment company \u201d ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for\npurposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and to relieve\nthe Fund of any liability for federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to\nshareholders. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may severely\nlimit the investment flexibility of a Fund and may make it less likely that the Fund will meet its\ninvestment objective. ASSET-BACKED AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES Asset-backed securities are\nsecurities backed by installment contracts, credit-card receivables or other assets. Commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities are securities backed by commercial real estate properties. Both asset-backed and\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities represent interests in \u201c pools \u201d of assets in which payments of both\ninterest and principal on the securities are made on a regular basis. The payments are, in effect, \u201c passed\nthrough \u201d to the holder of the securities (net of any fees paid to the issuer or guarantor of the\nsecurities). The average life of asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities varies with the\nmaturities of the underlying instruments and, as a result of prepayments, can often be less than the\noriginal maturity of the assets underlying the securities. For this and other reasons, an asset-backed and\ncommercial mortgage-backed security's stated maturity may be shortened, and the security's total return may\nbe difficult to predict precisely. BONDS A bond is an interest-bearing security issued by a company,\ngovernmental unit or, in some cases, a non-U.S. entity. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to\npay interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to repay principal (the bond's face value) periodically\nor on a specified maturity date; provided, however, a zero coupon bond pays no interest to its holder during\nits life. The value of a zero coupon bond to a Fund consists of the difference between such bond's face\nvalue at the time of maturity and the price for which it was acquired, which may be an amount significantly\nless than its face value (sometimes referred to as a \u201c deep discount \u201d price). An issuer may have the right\nto redeem or \u201c call \u201d a bond before maturity, in which case the investor may have to reinvest the proceeds\nat lower market rates. Most bonds bear interest income at a \u201c coupon \u201d rate that is fixed for the life of\nthe bond. The value of a fixed rate bond usually rises when market interest rates fall, and falls when\nmarket interest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed rate bond's yield (income as a percent of the bond's\ncurrent value) may differ from its coupon rate as its value rises or falls. Fixed rate bonds generally are\nalso subject to inflation risk, which is the risk that the value of the bond or income from the bond will be\nworth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. This could mean that, as inflation\nincreases, the \u201c real \u201d value of the assets of a Fund holding fixed rate bonds can decline, as can the value\nof the Fund's distributions. Other types of bonds bear income at an interest rate that is adjusted\nperiodically. Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of \u201c floating-rate \u201d or \u201c variable-rate\n\u201d bonds fluctuates much less in response to market interest rate movements than the value of fixed rate\nbonds. A Fund may treat some of these bonds as having a shorter maturity for purposes of calculating the\nweighted average maturity of its investment portfolio. Bonds may be senior or subordinated obligations.\nSenior obligations generally have the first claim on a corporation's earnings and assets and, in the event\nof liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be unsecured (backed only by the\nissuer's general creditworthiness) or secured (also backed by specified collateral). The investment return\nof corporate bonds reflects interest on the bond and changes in the market value of the bond. The market\nvalue of a corporate bond may be affected by the credit rating of the corporation, the corporation's\nperformance and perceptions of the corporation in the market place. There is a risk that the issuers of the\nsecurities may not be able to meet their obligations on interest or principal payments at the time called\nfor by such a security.\n\n4\n\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER Commercial paper consists of short-term, promissory notes issued by banks, corporations and\nother entities to finance short-term credit needs. These securities generally are discounted but sometimes\nmay be interest bearing. CONCENTRATION Each Fund will concentrate its investments in securities of issuers\nin the same industry as may be necessary to approximate the composition of the Fund's underlying Index. The\nsecurities of issuers in particular industries may dominate the benchmark Index of a Fund and consequently a\nFund's investment portfolio. This may adversely affect a Fund's performance or subject its Shares to greater\nprice volatility than that experienced by less concentrated investment companies. The Trust's general policy\nis to exclude securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities when measuring\nindustry concentration. In pursuing its objective, each Fund may hold the securities of a single issuer in\nan amount exceeding 10% of the market value of the outstanding securities of the issuer, subject to\nrestrictions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. In particular, as a Fund's size grows and its assets\nincrease, it will be more likely to hold more than 10% of the securities of a single issuer if the issuer\nhas a relatively small public float as compared to other components in its benchmark Index. CONVERTIBLE\nSECURITIES Convertible securities are bonds, debentures, notes, preferred stock or other securities that may\nbe converted or exchanged (by the holder or by the issuer) into shares of the underlying common stock (or\ncash or securities of equivalent value) at a stated exchange ratio. A convertible security may also be\ncalled for redemption or conversion by the issuer after a particular date and under certain circumstances\n(including a specified price) established upon issue. If a convertible security held by a Fund is called for\nredemption or conversion, the Fund could be required to tender it for redemption, convert it into the\nunderlying common stock, or sell it to a third party. Convertible securities generally have less potential\nfor gain or loss than common stock. Convertible securities generally provide yields higher than the\nunderlying common stock, but generally lower than comparable non-convertible securities. Because of this\nhigher yield, convertible securities generally sell at a price above their \u201c conversion value, \u201d which is\nthe current market value of the stock to be received upon conversion. The difference between this conversion\nvalue and the price of convertible securities will vary over time depending on changes in the value of the\nunderlying common stock and interest rates. When the underlying common stock declines in value, convertible\nsecurities will tend not to decline to the same extent because of the interest or dividend payments and the\nrepayment of principal at maturity for certain types of convertible securities. However, securities that are\nconvertible other than at the option of the holder generally do not limit the potential for loss to the same\nextent as securities convertible at the option of the holder. When the underlying common stock rises in\nvalue, the value of convertible securities may also be expected to increase. At the same time, however, the\ndifference between the market value of convertible securities and their conversion value will narrow, which\nmeans that the value of convertible securities will generally not increase to the same extent as the value\nof the underlying common stock. Because convertible securities may also be interest-rate sensitive, their\nvalue may increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. Convertible securities are\nalso subject to credit risk, and are often lower-quality securities. EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS Each Fund may\ninvest in other exchange-traded funds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) (including ETFs managed by the Adviser). ETFs may be\nstructured as investment companies that are registered under the 1940 Act, typically as open-end funds or\nunit investment trusts. These ETFs are generally based on specific domestic and foreign market securities\nindices. An \u201c index-based ETF \u201d seeks to provide investment results that match the performance of an index\nby holding in its portfolio either the contents of the index or a representative sample of the securities in\nthe index. An \u201c actively-managed ETF \u201d invests in securities based on an adviser's investment strategy. An \u201c\nenhanced ETF \u201d seeks to provide investment results that match a positive or negative multiple of the\nperformance of an underlying index. In seeking to provide such results, an ETF and, in particular, an\nenhanced ETF, may engage in short sales of securities included in the underlying index and may invest in\nderivatives instruments, such as equity index swaps, futures contracts, and options on securities, futures\ncontracts, and stock indices. Alternatively, ETFs may be structured as grantor trusts or other forms of\npooled investment vehicles that are not registered or regulated under the 1940 Act. These ETFs typically\nhold commodities, precious metals, currency or other non-securities investments. ETFs, like mutual funds,\nhave expenses associated with their operation, such as advisory and custody fees. When a Fund invests in an\nETF, in addition to directly bearing expenses associated with its own operations, including the brokerage\ncosts associated with the purchase and sale of shares of the ETF, the Fund will bear a pro rata\n\n5\n\nportion of the ETF's expenses. In addition, it may be more costly to own an ETF than to directly own the\nsecurities or other investments held by the ETF because of ETF expenses. The risks of owning shares of an\nETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities or other investments held by the ETF,\nalthough lack of liquidity in the market for the shares of an ETF could result in the ETF's value being more\nvolatile than the underlying securities or other investments. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Each Fund may\nconduct foreign currency transactions on a spot (i.e., cash) or forward basis (i.e., by entering into\nforward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies). Although foreign exchange dealers generally do\nnot charge a fee for such conversions, they do realize a profit based on the difference between the prices\nat which they are buying and selling various currencies. Thus, a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency\nat one rate, while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the counterparty desire to resell that currency\nto the dealer. Forward contracts are customized transactions that generally require a specific amount of a\ncurrency to be delivered at a specific exchange rate on a specific date or range of dates in the future,\nalthough the Funds may also enter into non-deliverable currency forward contracts ( \u201c NDFs \u201d ) that\ncontractually require the netting of the parties' liabilities. Forwards, including NDFs, can have\nsubstantial price volatility. While foreign currency transactions on a spot and forward basis are exempt\nfrom the definition of \u201c swap \u201d under the Commodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ), NDFs are not, and, thus, are\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( \u201c CFTC \u201d ). Forward contracts are\ngenerally traded in an interbank market directly between currency traders (usually large commercial banks)\nand their customers. The parties to a forward contract may agree to offset or terminate the contract before\nits maturity, or may hold the contract to maturity and complete the contemplated currency exchange. In the\nevent that the parties to a forward contract agree to offset or terminate the contract before its maturity,\nthe contract is no longer exempt from the definition of \u201c swap \u201d under the CEA and shall be treated as a\nswap. At the discretion of the Adviser, the Funds may enter into forward currency exchange contracts for\nhedging purposes to help reduce the risks and volatility caused by changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates, or to gain exposure to certain currencies in an effort to track the composition of the applicable\nIndex. When used for hedging purposes, they tend to limit any potential gain that may be realized if the\nvalue of a Fund's foreign holdings increases because of currency fluctuations. FUTURES CONTRACTS, OPTIONS\nAND SWAP AGREEMENTS Each Fund may invest in derivatives, including exchange-traded futures on indices,\nexchange-traded futures on Treasuries or Eurodollars, U.S. exchange-traded or OTC put and call options\ncontracts and exchange-traded or OTC swap transactions (including NDFs, interest rate swaps, total return\nswaps, excess return swaps, and credit default swaps). Futures and Options on Futures: Futures contracts\ngenerally provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified commodity or\nsecurity at a specified future time and at a specified price. Index futures contracts are settled daily with\na payment by one party to the other of a cash amount based on the difference between the level of the index\nspecified in the contract from one day to the next. A futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant\nto which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between the\nvalue of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the index\ncontract originally was written. Although the value of an index might be a function of the value of certain\nspecified securities, physical delivery of these securities is not always made. A public market exists in\nfutures contracts covering a number of indexes, as well as financial instruments, including, without\nlimitation: U.S. Treasury bonds; U.S. Treasury notes; GNMA Certificates; three-month U.S. Treasury bills;\n90-day commercial paper; bank certificates of deposit; Eurodollar certificates of deposit; the Australian\nDollar; the Canadian Dollar; the British Pound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss Franc; the Mexican Peso; and\ncertain multinational currencies, such as the Euro. It is expected that other futures contracts will be\ndeveloped and traded in the future. Futures contracts are standardized as to maturity date and underlying\ninstrument and are traded on futures exchanges. The Funds may purchase and write (sell) call and put options\non futures. Options on futures give the holder the right, in return for the premium paid, to assume a long\nposition (call) or short position (put) in a futures contract at a specified exercise price upon expiration\nof, or at any time during the period of, the option. Upon exercise of a call option, the holder acquires a\nlong position in the futures contract and the writer is assigned the opposite short position. In the case of\na put option, the opposite is true. A Fund is required to make a good faith margin deposit in cash or U.S.\ngovernment securities (or other eligible collateral) with a broker or custodian to initiate and maintain\nopen positions in futures contracts. A margin deposit is intended to assure completion of the contract\n(delivery or acceptance of the underlying commodity or payment of the cash settlement\n\n6\n\namount) if it is not terminated prior to the specified delivery date. Brokers may establish deposit\nrequirements which are higher than the exchange minimums. Futures contracts are customarily purchased and\nsold on margin deposits which may range upward from less than 5% of the value of the contract being traded.\nAfter a futures contract position is opened, the value of the contract is marked to market daily. If the\nfutures contract price changes to the extent that the margin on deposit does not satisfy price changes,\nadditional payments will be required. Conversely, change in the contract value may reduce the required\nmargin, resulting in a repayment of excess margin to the contract holder. Variation margin payments are made\nto and from the futures broker for as long as the contract remains open. In such case, a Fund would expect\nto earn interest income on its margin deposits. Although some futures contracts call for making or taking\ndelivery of the underlying commodity, generally these obligations are closed out prior to delivery by\noffsetting purchases or sales of matching futures contracts (involving the same exchange, underlying\ncommodity, security or index and delivery month). If an offsetting purchase price is less than the original\nsale price, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if it is more, the Fund realizes a capital loss.\nConversely, if an offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase price, the Fund realizes a\ncapital gain, or if it is less, the Fund realizes a capital loss. The transaction costs also must be\nincluded in these calculations. Options: A Fund may purchase and sell put and call options. Such options may\nrelate to particular securities and may or may not be listed on a national securities exchange and issued by\nthe Options Clearing Corporation. Options trading is a highly specialized activity that entails greater than\nordinary investment risk. Options on particular securities may be more volatile than the underlying\nsecurities, and therefore, on a percentage basis, an investment in options may be subject to greater\nfluctuation than an investment in the underlying securities themselves. Short Sales \u201c Against the Box \u201d :\nThe Funds may engage in short sales \u201c against the box. \u201d In a short sale against the box, a Fund agrees to\nsell at a future date a security that it either contemporaneously owns or has the right to acquire at no\nextra cost. If the price of the security has declined at the time the Fund is required to deliver the\nsecurity, the Fund will benefit from the difference in the price. If the price of the security has\nincreased, the Fund will be required to pay the difference. Swap Transactions: Each Fund may enter into swap\ntransactions, including interest rate swap, credit default swap, NDF, and total return swap transactions.\nSwap transactions are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to the\nother party based on the change in market value or level of a specified rate, index or asset. In return, the\nother party agrees to make payments to the first party based on the return of a different specified rate,\nindex or asset. Swap transactions will usually be done on a net basis, i.e., where the two parties make net\npayments with a Fund receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. The\nnet amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund's obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap is\naccrued on a daily basis and an amount of cash or equivalents having an aggregate value at least equal to\nthe accrued excess is maintained by the Fund. Swaps may be used in conjunction with other instruments to\noffset interest rate, currency or other underlying risks. For example, interest rate swaps may be offset\nwith \u201c caps, \u201d \u201c floors \u201d or \u201c collars. \u201d A \u201c cap \u201d is essentially a call option which places a limit on the\namount of floating rate interest that must be paid on a certain principal amount. A \u201c floor \u201d is essentially\na put option which places a limit on the minimum amount that would be paid on a certain principal amount. A\n\u201c collar \u201d is essentially a combination of a long cap and a short floor where the limits are set at\ndifferent levels. The use of swap transactions by a Fund entails certain risks, which may be different from,\nor possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the securities and other\ninvestments that are the referenced asset for the swap agreement. Swaps are highly specialized instruments\nthat require investment techniques, risk analyses, and tax planning different from those associated with\nstocks, bonds, and other traditional investments. The use of a swap requires an understanding not only of\nthe referenced asset, reference rate, or index, but also of the swap itself, without the benefit of\nobserving the performance of the swap under all the possible market conditions. Because some swap\ntransactions have a leverage component, adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying asset,\nreference rate, or index can result in a loss substantially greater than the amount invested in the swap\nitself. Certain swaps have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. Bilateral OTC transactions differ from exchange-traded or cleared derivatives transactions in\nseveral respects. Bilateral OTC transactions are transacted directly with dealers and not with a clearing\ncorporation. Without the availability of a clearing corporation, bilateral OTC transaction pricing is\nnormally done by reference to information from market makers and/or available index data, which information\nis carefully monitored by the Adviser and verified in appropriate cases. As bilateral OTC transactions are\nentered into directly with a dealer, there is a risk of nonperformance by the dealer as a result of its\ninsolvency or otherwise. Under regulations adopted by the CFTC and federal banking regulators ( \u201c Margin\nRules \u201d ), a Fund is required to post collateral (known as variation margin) to cover the mark-to-market\nexposure in respect of its uncleared swaps. The Margin Rules also mandate that collateral in the form of\ninitial margin be posted to cover\n\n7\n\npotential future exposure attributable to uncleared swap transactions. In the event a Fund is required to\npost collateral in the form of initial margin or variation margin in respect of its uncleared swap\ntransactions, all such collateral will be posted with a third party custodian pursuant to a triparty custody\nagreement between the Fund, its dealer counterparty and an unaffiliated custodian. The requirement to\nexecute certain OTC derivatives contracts on exchanges or electronic trading platforms called swap execution\nfacilities ( \u201c SEFs \u201d ) may offer certain advantages over traditional bilateral OTC trading, such as ease of\nexecution, price transparency, increased liquidity and/or favorable pricing. However, SEF trading may make\nit more difficult and costly for a Fund to enter into highly tailored or customized transactions and may\nresult in additional costs and risks. Market participants such as the Funds that execute derivatives\ncontracts through a SEF, whether directly or through a broker intermediary, are required to submit to the\njurisdiction of the SEF and comply with SEF and CFTC rules and regulations which impose, among other things\ndisclosure and recordkeeping obligations. In addition, a Fund will generally incur SEF or broker\nintermediary fees when it trades on a SEF. A Fund may also be required to indemnify the SEF or broker\nintermediary for any losses or costs that may result from the Fund's transactions on the SEF. Total Return\nSwaps: A Fund may enter into total return swap transactions for investment purposes. Total return swaps are\ntransactions in which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in market value of the\nunderlying assets, which may include a specified security, basket of securities or security indexes during\nthe specified period, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate of the\ntotal return from other underlying assets. Total return swaps may be used to obtain exposure to a security\nor market without owning or taking physical custody of such security or market, including in cases in which\nthere may be disadvantages associated with direct ownership of a particular security. In a typical total\nreturn equity swap, payments made by a Fund or the counterparty are based on the total return of a\nparticular reference asset or assets (such as an equity security, a combination of such securities, or an\nindex). That is, one party agrees to pay another party the return on a stock, basket of stocks, or stock\nindex in return for a specified interest rate. By entering into an equity index swap, for example, the index\nreceiver can gain exposure to stocks making up the index of securities without actually purchasing those\nstocks. Total return swaps involve not only the risk associated with the investment in the underlying\nsecurities, but also the risk of the counterparty not fulfilling its obligations under the agreement. Credit\nDefault Swaps: A Fund may enter into credit default swap transactions for investment purposes. A credit\ndefault swap transaction may have as reference obligations one or more securities that are not currently\nheld by the Fund. A Fund may be either the protection buyer or protection seller in the transaction. Credit\ndefault swaps may also be structured based on the debt of a basket of issuers, rather than a single issuer,\nand may be customized with respect to the default event that triggers purchase or other factors. As a\nprotection seller, a Fund would generally receive an upfront payment or a fixed rate of income throughout\nthe term of the swap, which typically is between six months and three years, provided that there is no\ncredit event. If a credit event occurs, generally the protection seller must pay the protection buyer the\nfull face amount of the reference obligations that may have little or no value. If a Fund were a protection\nbuyer and no credit event occurred during the term of the swap, the Fund would recover nothing if the swap\nwere held through its termination date. However, if a credit event occurred, the protection buyer may elect\nto receive the full notional value of the swap in exchange for an equal face amount of the reference\nobligation that may have little or no value. Where a Fund is the protection buyer, credit default swaps\ninvolve the risk that the seller may fail to satisfy its payment obligations to the Fund in the event of a\ndefault. The purchase of credit default swaps involves costs, which will reduce a Fund's return. Currency\nSwaps: A Fund may enter into currency swap transactions for investment purposes. Currency swaps are similar\nto interest rate swaps, except that they involve multiple currencies. A Fund may enter into a currency swap\nwhen it has exposure to one currency and desires exposure to a different currency. Typically, the interest\nrates that determine the currency swap payments are fixed, although occasionally one or both parties may pay\na floating rate of interest. Unlike an interest rate swap, however, the principal amounts are exchanged at\nthe beginning of the contract and returned at the end of the contract. In addition to paying and receiving\namounts at the beginning and end of the transaction, both sides will have to pay in full on a periodic basis\nbased upon the currency they have borrowed. Change in foreign exchange rates and changes in interest rates,\nas described above, may negatively affect currency swaps. Interest Rate Swaps: A Fund may enter into an\ninterest rate swap in an effort to protect against declines in the value of fixed income securities held by\nthe Fund. In such an instance, the Fund may agree to pay a fixed rate (multiplied by a notional amount)\nwhile a counterparty agrees to pay a floating rate (multiplied by the same notional amount). If interest\nrates rise, resulting in a diminution in the value of the Fund's portfolio, the Fund would receive payments\nunder the swap that would offset, in whole or in part, such diminution in value.\n\n8\n\nOptions on Swaps: An option on a swap agreement, or a \u201c swaption, \u201d is a contract that gives a counterparty\nthe right (but not the obligation) to enter into a new swap agreement or to shorten, extend, cancel or\notherwise modify an existing swap agreement, at some designated future time on specified terms. In return,\nthe purchaser pays a \u201c premium \u201d to the seller of the contract. The seller of the contract receives the\npremium and bears the risk of unfavorable changes on the underlying swap. A Fund may write (sell) and\npurchase put and call swaptions. A Fund may also enter into swaptions on either an asset-based or liability-\nbased basis, depending on whether the Fund is hedging its assets or its liabilities. A Fund may write (sell)\nand purchase put and call swaptions to the same extent it may make use of standard options on securities or\nother instruments. A Fund may enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a\nparticular investment or portion of its holdings, as a duration management technique, to protect against an\nincrease in the price of securities the Fund anticipates purchasing at a later date, or for any other\npurposes, such as for speculation to increase returns. Swaptions are generally subject to the same risks\ninvolved in a Fund's use of options. Depending on the terms of the particular option agreement, a Fund will\ngenerally incur a greater degree of risk when it writes a swaption than it will incur when it purchases a\nswaption. When a Fund purchases a swaption, it risks losing only the amount of the premium it has paid\nshould it decide to let the option expire unexercised. However, when a Fund writes a swaption, upon exercise\nof the option the Fund will become obligated according to the terms of the underlying agreement. Government\nRegulation: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201c Dodd-Frank Act \u201d ) that was\nsigned into law on July 21, 2010 created a new statutory framework that comprehensively regulated the over-\nthe-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) derivatives markets for the first time. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the OTC\nderivatives markets were traditionally traded on a bilateral basis (so-called \u201c bilateral OTC transactions \u201d\n). Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain OTC derivatives transactions are now required to be centrally cleared\nand traded on SEFs. On October 28, 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 18f-4 (the \u201c Derivatives Rule \u201d ) under the\n1940 Act which replaced prior SEC and staff guidance with an updated, comprehensive framework for registered\nfunds' use of derivatives. The Derivatives Rule permits a Fund to enter into derivatives transactions and\ncertain other transactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior securities \u201d under\nSection 18 of the 1940 Act. The Derivatives Rule requires the Funds to trade derivatives and certain other\ninstruments that create future payment or delivery obligations subject to a value-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d )\nleverage limit, develop and implement a derivatives risk management program and new testing requirements,\nand comply with new requirements related to board and SEC reporting. These requirements apply unless a Fund\nqualifies as a \u201c limited derivatives user, \u201d as defined in the Derivatives Rule. Complying with the\nDerivatives Rule may increase the cost of a Fund's investments and cost of doing business, which could\nadversely affect investors. Other new regulations could adversely affect the value, availability and\nperformance of certain derivative instruments, may make them more costly, and may limit or restrict their\nuse by the Funds. Regulation Under the Commodity Exchange Act: Each Fund intends to use commodity interests,\nsuch as futures, swaps and options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the CEA. A Fund may use\nexchange-traded futures and options on futures, together with positions in cash and money market\ninstruments, to simulate full investment in its underlying Index. Exchange-traded futures and options on\nfutures contracts may not be currently available for an Index. Under such circumstances, the Adviser may\nseek to utilize other instruments that it believes to be correlated to the applicable Index components or a\nsubset of the components. An exclusion from the definition of the term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d has been\nclaimed with respect to each series of the Trust in accordance with Rule 4.5 such that registration or\nregulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA is not necessary. Restrictions on Trading in Commodity\nInterests: Each Fund reserves the right to engage in transactions involving futures, options thereon and\nswaps to the extent allowed by the CFTC regulations in effect from time to time and in accordance with a\nFund's policies. Certain additional risk factors related to derivatives are discussed below: Derivatives\nRisk: Under recently adopted rules by the CFTC, transactions in some types of interest rate swaps and index\ncredit default swaps on North American and European indices are required to be cleared. In addition, the\nCFTC may promulgate additional regulations that require clearing of other classes of swaps. In a cleared\nderivatives transaction (which includes futures, options on futures, and cleared swaps transactions), a\nFund's counterparty is a clearing house (such as CME, ICE Clear Credit or LCH.Clearnet), rather than a bank\nor broker. Since each Fund is not a member of a clearing house and only members of a clearing house can\nparticipate directly in the clearing house, a Fund holds cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers, who are futures commission merchants that are members of the clearing houses and who have the\nappropriate regulatory\n\n9\n\napprovals to engage in cleared derivatives transactions. A Fund makes and receives payments owed under\ncleared derivatives transactions (including margin payments) through its accounts at clearing members.\nClearing members guarantee performance of their clients' obligations to the clearing house. In contrast to\nbilateral OTC transactions, clearing members generally can require termination of existing cleared\nderivatives transactions at any time and increases in margin above the margin that it required at the\nbeginning of a transaction. Clearing houses also have broad rights to increase margin requirements for\nexisting transactions and to terminate transactions in accordance with their rules. Any such increase or\ntermination could interfere with the ability of a Fund to pursue its investment strategy. Also, a Fund is\nsubject to execution risk if it enters into a derivatives transaction that is required to be cleared (or\nthat the Advisor expects to be cleared), and no clearing member is willing or able to clear the transaction\non the Fund's behalf. While the documentation in place between a Fund and its clearing members generally\nprovides that the clearing members will accept for clearing all transactions submitted for clearing that are\nwithin credit limits specified by the clearing members in advance, the Fund could be subject to this\nexecution risk if the Fund submits for clearing transactions that exceed such credit limits, if the clearing\nhouse does not accept the transactions for clearing, or if the clearing members do not comply with their\nagreement to clear such transactions. In that case, the transaction might have to be terminated, and the\nFund could lose some or all of the benefit of any increase in the value of the transaction after the time of\nthe transaction. In addition, new regulations could, among other things, restrict a Fund's ability to engage\nin, or increase the cost to the Fund of, derivatives transactions, for example, by making some types of\nderivatives no longer available to the Fund or increasing margin or capital requirements. If a Fund is not\nable to enter into a particular derivatives transaction, the Fund's investment performance and risk profile\ncould be adversely affected as a result. Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk with respect to OTC\nderivatives may be affected by new regulations promulgated by the CFTC and SEC affecting the derivatives\nmarket. As described under \u201c Derivatives Risk \u201d above, all futures and options on futures and some swap\ntransactions are required to be cleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives transaction is subject to the\ncredit risk of the clearing house and the clearing member through which it holds its cleared derivatives\nposition, rather than the credit risk of its original counterparty to the derivative transaction. Clearing\nmembers are required to segregate all funds received from customers with respect to cleared derivatives\ntransactions from the clearing member's proprietary assets. However, all funds and other property received\nby a clearing broker from its customers are generally held by the clearing broker on a commingled basis in\nan omnibus account, and the clearing broker may also invest those funds in certain instruments permitted\nunder the applicable regulations. Also, the clearing member transfers to the clearing house the amount of\nmargin required by the clearing house for cleared derivatives transactions, which amounts are generally held\nin the relevant omnibus account at the clearing house for all customers of the clearing member. For\ncommodities futures positions, the clearing house may use all of the collateral held in the clearing\nmember's omnibus account to meet a loss in that account, without regard to which customer in fact supplied\nthat collateral. Accordingly, in addition to bearing the credit risk of its clearing member, each customer\nto a futures transaction also bears \u201c fellow customer \u201d risk from other customers of the clearing member.\nHowever, with respect to cleared swaps positions, recent regulations promulgated by the CFTC require that\nthe clearing member notify the clearing house of the amount of initial margin provided by the clearing\nmember to the clearing house that is attributable to each customer. Because margin in respect of cleared\nswaps must be earmarked for specific clearing member customers, the clearing house may not use the\ncollateral of one customer to cover the obligations of another customer. However, if the clearing member\ndoes not provide accurate reporting, a Fund is subject to the risk that a clearing house will use the Fund's\nassets held in an omnibus account at the clearing house to satisfy payment obligations of a defaulting\ncustomer of the clearing member to the clearing house. In addition, clearing members may generally choose to\nprovide to the clearing house the net amount of variation margin required for cleared swaps for all of its\ncustomers in the aggregate, rather than the gross amount for each customer. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS A Fund may\ntake advantage of opportunities in the area of options and futures contracts, options on futures contracts,\nwarrants, swaps and any other investments which are not presently contemplated for use by the Fund or which\nare not currently available but which may be developed, to the extent such opportunities are both consistent\nwith the Fund's investment objective and legally permissible for the Fund. Before entering into such\ntransactions or making any such investment, a Fund will provide appropriate disclosure.\n\n10\n\nHIGH YIELD SECURITIES Investment in high yield securities (commonly known as \u201c junk \u201d bonds) generally\nprovides greater income and increased opportunity for capital appreciation than investments in higher\nquality securities, but they also typically entail greater price volatility and credit risk. These high\nyield securities are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability\nto meet principal and interest payments. Analysis of the creditworthiness of issuers of debt securities that\nare high yield may be more complex than for issuers of higher quality debt securities. In addition, high\nyield securities are often issued by smaller, less creditworthy companies or by highly leveraged (indebted)\nfirms, but can also be issued by governments. Such issuers are generally less able than more financially\nstable issuers to make scheduled payments of interest and principal. The risks posed by securities issued\nunder such circumstances are substantial. Investing in high yield debt securities involves risks that are\ngreater than the risks of investing in higher quality debt securities. These risks include: (i) changes in\ncredit status, including weaker overall credit conditions of issuers and risks of default; (ii) industry,\nmarket and economic risk; and (iii) greater price variability and credit risks of certain high yield\nsecurities such as zero coupon and payment-in-kind securities. While these risks provide the opportunity for\nmaximizing return over time, they may result in greater volatility of the value of a Fund than a fund that\ninvests in higher-rated securities. Furthermore, the value of high yield securities may be more susceptible\nto real or perceived adverse economic, company or industry conditions than is the case for higher quality\nsecurities. The market values of certain of these lower-rated and unrated debt securities tend to reflect\nindividual issuer developments to a greater extent than do higher-rated securities which react primarily to\nfluctuations in the general level of interest rates, and tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions\nthan are higher-rated securities. Adverse market, credit or economic conditions could make it difficult at\ncertain times to sell certain high yield securities held by a Fund. The secondary market on which high yield\nsecurities are traded may be less liquid than the market for higher grade securities. Less liquidity in the\nsecondary trading market could adversely affect the price at which a Fund could sell a high yield security,\nand could adversely affect the daily net asset value per share of a Fund. When secondary markets for high\nyield securities are less liquid than the market for higher grade securities, it may be more difficult to\nvalue the securities because there is less reliable, objective data available. The use of credit ratings as\na principal method of selecting high yield securities can involve certain risks. For example, credit ratings\nevaluate the safety of principal and interest payments, not the market value risk of high yield securities.\nAlso, credit rating agencies may fail to change credit ratings in a timely fashion to reflect events since\nthe security was last rated. ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS Each Fund may invest in illiquid investments. A Fund may\nnot acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more\nthan 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment means any investment that a Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less\nwithout the sale or disposition significantly changing the market value of the investment. If illiquid\ninvestments exceed 15% of a Fund's net assets, certain remedial actions will be taken as required by Rule\n22e-4 under the 1940 Act and the Funds' policies and procedures. INFLATION-PROTECTED OBLIGATIONS Each Fund\nmay invest in inflation-protected public obligations, commonly known as \u201c TIPS, \u201d of the U.S. Treasury, as\nwell as TIPS of major governments and emerging market countries, excluding the United States. TIPS are a\ntype of security issued by a government that are designed to provide inflation protection to investors. TIPS\nare income-generating instruments whose interest and principal payments are adjusted for inflation\u2014a\nsustained increase in prices that erodes the purchasing power of money. The inflation adjustment, which is\ntypically applied monthly to the principal of the bond, follows a designated inflation index, such as the\nConsumer Price Index. A fixed coupon rate is applied to the inflation-adjusted principal so that as\ninflation rises or falls, both the principal value and the interest payments will increase or decrease. This\ncan provide investors with a hedge against inflation, as it helps preserve the purchasing power of an\ninvestment. Because of this inflation adjustment feature, inflation-protected bonds typically have lower\nyields than conventional fixed-rate bonds.\n\n11\n\nINVESTMENT COMPANIES Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies, including\naffiliated funds and money market funds, subject to applicable limitations under Section 12(d)(1) of the\n1940 Act. Pursuant to Section 12(d)(1), a Fund may invest in the securities of another investment company\n(the \u201c acquired company \u201d ) provided that the Fund, immediately after such purchase or acquisition, does not\nown in the aggregate: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company; (ii)\nsecurities issued by the acquired company having an aggregate value in excess of 5% of the value of the\ntotal assets of the Fund; or (iii) securities issued by the acquired company and all other investment\ncompanies (other than Treasury stock of the Fund) having an aggregate value in excess of 10% of the value of\nthe total assets of the Fund. To the extent allowed by law, regulation, and/or a Fund's investment\nrestrictions, a Fund may invest its assets in securities of investment companies, including affiliated funds\nand/or money market funds, in excess of the limits discussed above. If a Fund invests in and, thus, is a\nshareholder of, another investment company, the Fund's shareholders will indirectly bear the Fund's\nproportionate share of the fees and expenses paid by such other investment company, including advisory fees,\nin addition to both the management fees payable directly by the Fund to the Fund's own investment adviser\nand the other expenses that the Fund bears directly in connection with the Fund's own operations. LENDING\nPORTFOLIO SECURITIES Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain creditworthy borrowers in U.S. and\nnon-U.S. markets in an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets. The borrowers provide\ncollateral that is marked to market daily in an amount at least equal to the current market value of the\nsecurities loaned. A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the securities loaned. A Fund receives\nthe value of any interest or cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned securities. A Fund cannot\nvote proxies for securities on loan, but may recall loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the\nFund's economic interest in the investment is to be voted upon. Efforts to recall such securities promptly\nmay be unsuccessful, especially for foreign securities or thinly traded securities. Distributions received\non loaned securities in lieu of dividend payments (i.e., substitute payments) would not be considered\nqualified dividend income. With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be\nentitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. A Fund is compensated by the difference\nbetween the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the\ncase of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a\npercentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain\nhigh quality short-term instruments either directly on behalf of the lending Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or funds, which may include those managed by the Adviser. A Fund could lose money due to a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or any investments made with cash\ncollateral. Certain non-cash collateral or investments made with cash collateral may have a greater risk of\nloss than other non-cash collateral or investments. A Fund may pay a portion of the interest or fees earned\nfrom securities lending to a borrower as described above, and to one or more securities lending agents\napproved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201c Board \u201d ) who administer the lending program for the\nFunds in accordance with guidelines approved by the Board. In such capacity, the lending agent provides the\nfollowing services to the Funds in connection with the Funds' securities lending activities: (i) locating\nborrowers among an approved list of prospective borrowers; (ii) causing the delivery of loaned securities\nfrom a Fund to borrowers; (iii) monitoring the value of loaned securities, the value of collateral received,\nand other lending parameters; (iv) seeking additional collateral, as necessary, from borrowers; (v)\nreceiving and holding collateral from borrowers, and facilitating the investment and reinvestment of all or\nsubstantially all cash collateral in an investment vehicle designated by the Funds; (vi) returning\ncollateral to borrowers; (vii) facilitating substitute dividend, interest, and other distribution payments\nto the Funds from borrowers; (viii) negotiating the terms of each loan of securities, including but not\nlimited to the amount of any loan premium, and monitoring the terms of securities loan agreements with\nprospective borrowers for consistency with the requirements of the Funds' Securities Lending Authorization\nAgreement; (ix) selecting securities, including amounts (percentages), to be loaned; (x) recordkeeping and\naccounting servicing; and (xi) arranging for return of loaned securities to the Fund in accordance with the\nterms of the Securities Lending Authorization Agreement. State Street Bank and Trust Company ( \u201c State\nStreet \u201d ), an affiliate of the Trust, has been approved by the Board to serve as securities lending agent\nfor the Funds and the Trust has entered into an agreement with State Street for such services. Among other\nmatters, the Trust has agreed to indemnify State Street for certain liabilities. State Street has received\nan order of exemption from the SEC under Sections 17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the 1940 Act to serve as the\nlending agent for affiliated investment companies such as the Trust and to invest the cash collateral\nreceived from loan transactions to be invested in an affiliated cash collateral fund.\n\n12\n\nSecurities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses\nresulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process especially so in certain international\nmarkets such as Taiwan), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), risk of loss of collateral, credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risk. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject\nto the risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a\npossible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund's securities as\nagreed, the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction\ncosts incurred in purchasing replacement securities. Although State Street has agreed to provide a Fund with\nindemnification in the event of a borrower default, a Fund is still exposed to the risk of losses in the\nevent a borrower does not return a Fund's securities as agreed. For example, delays in recovery of lent\nsecurities may cause a Fund to lose the opportunity to sell the securities at a desirable price. LEVERAGING\nWhile the Funds do not anticipate doing so, a Fund may borrow money in an amount greater than 5% of the\nvalue of the Fund's total assets. However, under normal circumstances, a Fund will not borrow money from a\nbank in an amount greater than 10% of the value of the Fund's total assets. Borrowing for investment\npurposes is one form of leverage. Leveraging investments, by purchasing securities with borrowed money, is a\nspeculative technique that increases investment risk, but also increases investment opportunity. Because\nsubstantially all of a Fund's assets will fluctuate in value, whereas the interest obligations on borrowings\nmay be fixed, the NAV of a Fund will increase more when such Fund's portfolio assets increase in value and\ndecrease more when the Fund's portfolio assets decrease in value than would otherwise be the case. Moreover,\ninterest costs on borrowings may fluctuate with changing market rates of interest and may partially offset\nor exceed the returns on the borrowed funds. OTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS Each Fund may invest in short-term\ninstruments, including money market instruments, (including money market funds advised by the Adviser), cash\nand cash equivalents, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term investments that may include but are not limited to: (i) shares of\nmoney market funds (including those advised by the Adviser); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the\nU.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c CDs \u201d ), bankers' acceptances, fixed time deposits and other\nobligations of U.S. and foreign banks (including foreign branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial\npaper rated at the date of purchase \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by Moody's Investors Service ( \u201c Moody's \u201d ) or \u201c A-1 \u201d by\nS&P Global Ratings ( \u201c S&P \u201d ), or if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by the Adviser; (v) non-\nconvertible corporate debt securities (e.g., bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of\npurchase of not more than 397 days and that present minimal credit risk; and (vi) short-term U.S. dollar-\ndenominated obligations of foreign banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of the Adviser, are\nof comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks which may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or a forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable\ndeposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers'\nacceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international\ntransactions. Money market instruments also include shares of money market funds. The SEC and other\ngovernment agencies continue to review the regulation of money market funds. The SEC has adopted changes to\nthe rules that govern money market funds over the years, most recently in July 2023. Legislative\ndevelopments may also affect money market funds. These changes and developments may affect the investment\nstrategies, performance, yield, operating expenses and continued viability of a money market fund. PRIVATE\nPLACEMENTS AND RESTRICTED SECURITIES Each Fund may invest in securities that are purchased in private\nplacements and, accordingly, are subject to restrictions on resale as a matter of contract or under federal\nsecurities laws. While such private placements may offer attractive opportunities for investment not\notherwise available on the open market, the securities so purchased are often \u201c restricted securities, \u201d\ni.e., securities which cannot be sold to the public without registration under the Securities Act or the\navailability of an exemption from registration (such as Rules 144 or 144A), or which are not readily\nmarketable because they are subject to other legal or contractual delays in or restrictions on resale.\nGenerally speaking, restricted securities may be\n\n13\n\nsold only to qualified institutional buyers, or in a privately negotiated transaction to a limited number of\npurchasers, or in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of time and other\nconditions are met pursuant to an exemption from registration, or in a public offering for which a\nregistration statement is in effect under the Securities Act. Because there may be relatively few potential\npurchasers for such investments, especially under adverse market or economic conditions or in the event of\nadverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer, a Fund could find it more difficult to sell such\nsecurities when the Adviser believes it advisable to do so or may be able to sell such securities only at\nprices lower than if such securities were more widely held. Market quotations for such securities are\ngenerally less readily available than for publicly traded securities. The absence of a trading market can\nmake it difficult to ascertain a market value for such securities for purposes of computing a Fund's net\nasset value, and the judgment of the Adviser may at times play a greater role in valuing these securities\nthan in the case of publicly traded securities. Disposing of such securities, which may be illiquid\ninvestments, can involve time-consuming negotiation and legal expenses, and it may be difficult or\nimpossible for a Fund to sell them promptly at an acceptable price. A Fund may have to bear the extra\nexpense of registering such securities for resale and the risk of substantial delay in effecting such\nregistration. A Fund may be deemed to be an \u201c underwriter \u201d for purposes of the Securities Act when selling\nrestricted securities to the public, and in such event the Fund may be liable to purchasers of such\nsecurities if the registration statement prepared by the issuer, or the prospectus forming a part of it, is\nmaterially inaccurate or misleading. RATINGS An investment grade rating means the security or issuer is\nrated investment grade by Moody's, S&P, Fitch Ratings, Inc. ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ), Dominion Bond Rating Service\nLimited, or another credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating\norganization by the SEC, or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by the Adviser. Subsequent\nto purchase by a Fund, a rated security may cease to be rated or its investment grade rating may be reduced\nbelow an investment grade rating. Bonds rated lower than Baa3 by Moody's or BBB- by S&P or Fitch are below\ninvestment grade quality and are obligations of issuers that are considered predominantly speculative with\nrespect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal according to the terms of the\nobligation and, therefore, carry greater investment risk, including the possibility of issuer default and\nbankruptcy and increased market price volatility. Such securities ( \u201c lower rated securities \u201d ) are\ncommonly referred to as \u201c junk \u201d bonds and are subject to a substantial degree of credit risk. Lower rated\nsecurities are often issued by smaller, less creditworthy companies or by highly leveraged (indebted) firms,\nwhich are generally less able than more financially stable firms to make scheduled payments of interest and\nprincipal. The risks posed by securities issued under such circumstances are substantial. Bonds rated below\ninvestment-grade tend to be less marketable than higher-quality bonds because the market for them is less\nbroad. The market for unrated bonds is even narrower. See \u201c HIGH YIELD SECURITIES \u201d above for more\ninformation relating to the risks associated with investing in lower rated securities, or Appendix A for\nmore information on the ratings of debt instruments. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS Each Fund may invest in\nrepurchase agreements with commercial banks, brokers or dealers to generate income from its excess cash\nbalances and to invest securities lending cash collateral. A repurchase agreement is an agreement under\nwhich a Fund acquires a financial instrument (e.g., a security issued by the U.S. government or an agency\nthereof, a banker's acceptance or a certificate of deposit) from a seller, subject to resale to the seller\nat an agreed upon price and date (normally, the next Business Day\u2014as defined below). A repurchase agreement\nmay be considered a loan collateralized by securities. The resale price reflects an agreed upon interest\nrate effective for the period the instrument is held by a Fund and is unrelated to the interest rate on the\nunderlying instrument. In these repurchase agreement transactions, the securities acquired by a Fund\n(including accrued interest earned thereon) must have a total value in excess of the value of the repurchase\nagreement and are held by the Custodian until repurchased. No more than an aggregate of 15% of a Fund's net\nassets will be invested in illiquid investments, including repurchase agreements having maturities longer\nthan seven days and securities subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale, or for which there\nare no readily available market quotations. The use of repurchase agreements involves certain risks. For\nexample, if the other party to the agreement defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying\nsecurity at a time when the value of the security has declined, a Fund may incur a loss upon disposition of\nthe security. If the other party to the agreement becomes insolvent and subject to liquidation or\n\n14\n\nreorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other laws, a court may determine that the underlying\nsecurity is collateral for a loan by a Fund not within the control of the Fund and, therefore, the Fund may\nnot be able to substantiate its interest in the underlying security and may be deemed an unsecured creditor\nof the other party to the agreement. REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS Each Fund may enter into reverse\nrepurchase agreements, which involve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities\nat an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. The securities\npurchased with the funds obtained from the agreement and securities collateralizing the agreement will have\nmaturity dates no later than the repayment date. Generally the effect of such transactions is that a Fund\ncan recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases a Fund is able to keep some of the interest income\nassociated with those securities. Such transactions are only advantageous if a Fund has an opportunity to\nearn a greater rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions than the interest cost of\nobtaining the same amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to\nor greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available and a Fund intends to use the\nreverse repurchase technique only when the Adviser believes it will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of\nreverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any interim increase or decrease in the value of a Fund's\nassets. A Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements if it either meets the relevant asset coverage\nrequirements of Section 18 of the 1940 Act for senior securities representing indebtedness, or elects to\ntreat such arrangements as derivatives transactions under the Derivatives Rule. Each Fund does not expect to\nengage, under normal circumstances, in reverse repurchase agreements with respect to more than 10% of its\ntotal assets. SOVEREIGN DEBT OBLIGATIONS Sovereign debt obligations are issued or guaranteed by foreign\ngovernments or their agencies. Sovereign debt may be in the form of conventional securities or other types\nof debt instruments such as loans or loan participations. Governmental entities responsible for repayment of\nthe debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal and pay interest when due, and may require\nrenegotiation or reschedule of debt payments. In addition, prospects for repayment of principal and payment\nof interest may depend on political as well as economic factors. Although some sovereign debt, such as Brady\nBonds, is collateralized by U.S. Government securities, repayment of principal and payment of interest is\nnot guaranteed by the U.S. Government. U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS U.S. Government obligations are a type of\nbond. U.S. Government obligations include securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by\nthe U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities. One type of U.S. Government obligation, U.S.\nTreasury obligations, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury and differ only in their\ninterest rates, maturities, and times of issuance. U.S. Treasury bills have initial maturities of one-year\nor less; U.S. Treasury notes have initial maturities of one to ten years; and U.S. Treasury bonds generally\nhave initial maturities of greater than ten years. Other U.S. Government obligations are issued or\nguaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S. Government including, but not limited to, Federal\nNational Mortgage Association ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d ), the Government National Mortgage Association ( \u201c Ginnie\nMae \u201d ), the Small Business Administration, the Federal Farm Credit Administration, the Federal Home Loan\nMortgage Corporation ( \u201c Freddie Mac \u201d ), the Federal Home Loan Banks ( \u201c FHLB \u201d ), Banks for Cooperatives\n(including the Central Bank for Cooperatives), the Federal Land Banks, the Federal Intermediate Credit\nBanks, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Commodity Credit\nCorporation, the Federal Financing Bank, the Student Loan Marketing Association, the National Credit Union\nAdministration and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac). Some obligations issued or\nguaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and instrumentalities, including, for example, Ginnie Mae pass-\nthrough certificates, are supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury. Other obligations\nissued by or guaranteed by federal agencies, such as those securities issued by Fannie Mae, are supported by\nthe discretionary authority of the U.S. Government to purchase certain obligations of the federal agency,\nwhile other obligations issued by or guaranteed by federal agencies, such as those of the Federal Home Loan\nBanks, are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury. While the U.S. Government\nprovides financial support to such U.S. Government-sponsored federal agencies, no assurance can be given\nthat the U.S. Government will always do so, since the U.S. Government is not so obligated by law.\n\n15\n\nIn September 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, placing the\ntwo federal instrumentalities in conservatorship. Under the terms of the takeover, the U.S. Treasury agreed\nto acquire $1 billion of senior preferred stock of each instrumentality and obtained warrants for the\npurchase of common stock of each instrumentality. Under these Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements ( \u201c\nSPAs \u201d ), the U.S. Treasury has pledged to provide a limited amount of capital per instrumentality as\nneeded, including the contribution of cash capital to the instrumentalities in the event their liabilities\nexceed their assets. In May 2009, the U.S. Treasury increased its maximum commitment to each instrumentality\nunder the SPAs from $100 billion to $200 billion per instrumentality. In December 2009, the U.S. Treasury\namended the SPAs to provide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with some additional flexibility to meet the\nrequirement to reduce their mortgage portfolios. Also in December 2009, the U.S. Treasury further amended\nthe SPAs to allow the cap on the U.S. Treasury's funding commitment to increase as necessary to accommodate\nany cumulative reduction in Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's net worth through the end of 2012. On August 17,\n2012, the U.S. Treasury announced that it was again amending the SPAs to terminate the requirement that\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac each pay a 10% dividend annually on all amounts received under the funding\ncommitment. Instead, they were required to transfer to the U.S. Treasury on a quarterly basis all profits\nearned during a quarter that exceeded a capital reserve amount of $3 billion. On September 30, 2019, the\nU.S. Treasury announced amendments to the SPAs permitting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to maintain capital\nreserves of $25 billion and $20 billion, respectively. It is believed that the amendment puts Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac in a better position to service their debt because the companies no longer have to borrow from\nthe U.S. Treasury to make fixed dividend payments. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the subject of several\ncontinuing class action lawsuits and investigations by federal regulators over certain accounting,\ndisclosure or corporate governance matters, which (along with any resulting financial restatements) may\nadversely affect the guaranteeing entities. Importantly, the future of the entities is in serious question\nas the U.S. government reportedly is considering multiple options, ranging from nationalization,\nprivatization, consolidation, or abolishment of the entities. VARIABLE AND FLOATING RATE SECURITIES Variable\nrate securities are instruments issued or guaranteed by entities such as (1) U.S. Government, or an agency\nor instrumentality thereof, (2) states, municipalities and other political subdivisions, agencies,\nauthorities and instrumentalities or states and multi-state agencies or authorities, (3) corporations, (4)\nfinancial institutions, (5) insurance companies or (6) trusts that have a rate of interest subject to\nadjustment at regular intervals but less frequently than annually. A variable rate security provides for the\nautomatic establishment of a new interest rate on set dates. Variable rate obligations whose interest is\nreadjusted no less frequently than annually will be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining\nuntil the next readjustment of the interest rate. A Fund may also purchase floating rate securities. A\nfloating rate security provides for the automatic adjustment of its interest rate whenever a specified\ninterest rate changes. Interest rates on these securities are ordinarily tied to, and are a percentage of, a\nwidely recognized interest rate, such as the yield on 90-day U.S. Treasury bills or the prime rate of a\nspecified bank. These rates may change as often as twice daily. Generally, changes in interest rates will\nhave a smaller effect on the market value of variable and fixed rate floating rate securities than on the\nmarket value of comparable fixed rate fixed income obligations. Thus, investing in variable and fixed rate\nfloating rate securities generally allows less opportunity for capital appreciation and depreciation than\ninvesting in comparable fixed rate fixed income securities. VARIABLE RATE DEMAND OBLIGATIONS Variable rate\ndemand obligations ( \u201c VRDOs \u201d ) are short-term tax-exempt fixed income instruments whose yield is reset on\na periodic basis. VRDO securities tend to be issued with long maturities of up to 30 or 40 years; however,\nthey are considered short-term instruments because they include a put feature which coincides with the\nperiodic yield reset. For example, a VRDO whose yield resets weekly will have a put feature that is\nexercisable upon seven days' notice. VRDOs are put back to a bank or other entity that serves as a liquidity\nprovider, who then tries to resell the VRDOs or, if unable to resell, holds them in its own inventory. VRDOs\nare generally supported by either a Letter of Credit or a Stand-by Bond Purchase Agreement to provide credit\nenhancement.\n\n16\n\nWHEN-ISSUED SECURITIES Each Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued basis. Delivery of and payment for\nthese securities may take place as long as a month or more after the date of the purchase commitment. The\nvalue of these securities is subject to market fluctuation during this period, and no income accrues to a\nFund until settlement takes place. When entering into a when-issued transaction, a Fund will rely on the\nother party to consummate the transaction; if the other party fails to do so, a Fund may be disadvantaged.\nSecurities purchased on a when-issued basis and held by a Fund are subject to changes in market value based\nupon actual or perceived changes in the level of interest rates. Generally, the value of such securities\nwill fluctuate inversely to changes in interest rates \u2014 i.e., they will appreciate in value when interest\nrates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise. Therefore, if a Fund purchases securities on a\n\u201c when-issued \u201d basis, there may be a greater possibility of fluctuation in the Fund's NAV. Special\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of the risks associated with an investment in each Fund is contained\nin the Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the Prospectus.\nGENERAL Investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of a Fund's portfolio\nsecurities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of securities generally and other factors. An investment in a Fund should\nalso be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in securities, including the risk\nthat the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the general condition of the securities\nmarkets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio securities and\nthus in the value of Shares). Securities are susceptible to general market fluctuations and to volatile\nincreases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors including expectations regarding\ngovernment, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or\ncontraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises. Securities of issuers traded on\nexchanges may be suspended on certain exchanges by the issuers themselves, by an exchange or by government\nauthorities. The likelihood of such suspensions may be higher for securities of issuers in emerging or less-\ndeveloped market countries than in countries with more developed markets. Trading suspensions may be applied\nfrom time to time to the securities of individual issuers for reasons specific to that issuer, or may be\napplied broadly by exchanges or governmental authorities in response to market events. Suspensions may last\nfor significant periods of time, during which trading in the securities and instruments that reference the\nsecurities, such as participatory notes (or \u201c P-notes \u201d ) or other derivative instruments, may be halted.\nThe principal trading market for some of the securities in an Index may be in the over-the-counter market.\nThe existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend on whether dealers will make a\nmarket in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or maintained or that any\nsuch market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of a Fund's\nShares will be adversely affected if trading markets for a Fund's portfolio securities are limited or absent\nor if bid/ask spreads are wide. CHINA BOND RISK Certain Funds may invest in renminbi ( \u201c RMB \u201d ) denominated\nfixed income securities of Chinese issuers ( \u201c China bonds \u201d ). To the extent a Fund's underlying Index\nincludes China bonds, the Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective is dependent on its continued\naccess to such bonds. The Funds may invest in China bonds (i) through direct access to the China Interbank\nBond Market ( \u201c CIBM \u201d ), (ii) through certain foreign institutional investors that have obtained a license\nfrom the Chinese regulators, and (iii) through Bond Connect, a program that provides foreign investors with\naccess to China's onshore bond market. CIBM Direct Access Program Risks: The CIBM is an OTC market\nestablished in 1997, and accounts for more than 95% of outstanding bond values of the total trading volume\nin the People's Republic of China (the \u201c PRC \u201d ). On CIBM, domestic institutional investors and certain\nforeign institutional investors can trade, on a one-to-one quote-driven basis, sovereign bonds, government\nbonds, corporate bonds, bond repo, bond lending, bills issued by the People's Bank of China\n\n17\n\n( \u201c PBOC \u201d ) and other financial debt instruments. Pursuant to the Announcement (2016) No. 3 issued by the\nPBOC on February 24, 2016, eligible foreign institutional investors can conduct trading on the CIBM under a\nprogram established by the PBOC ( \u201c CIBM Direct Access Program \u201d ) subject to other rules and regulations as\npromulgated by the PRC authorities. There is no trading quota limitation. CIBM is regulated and supervised\nby the PBOC. The PBOC is responsible for, among others, promulgating the applicable CIBM listing, trading\nand operating rules, and supervising the market operators of CIBM. Bonds and bond-related derivatives are\ntraded in the CIBM primarily through (i) independent bilateral negotiation on a transaction by transaction\nbasis or (ii) through the \u201c click-and-deal \u201d trading model, whereby a party offers a quote in the market\nthat can then be accepted by a counterparty (thus, \u201c clicking \u201d the \u201c deal \u201d ). A \u201c click-and-deal \u201d quote\nmay also be automatically matched with a price limit order. In addition, recently an \u201c anonymous click \u201d\ntrading model has been implemented for certain bonds and bond-related derivatives whereby anonymous quotes\noffered in the market are automatically matched with counterparties based on timing and price. Once a\ntransaction is agreed upon, the parties will, in accordance with the terms of the transaction, promptly send\ninstructions for the delivery of bonds and funds. Parties are required to have sufficient bonds and funds\nfor delivery on the agreed upon delivery date. China Central Depository & Clearing Co., Ltd ( \u201c CCDC \u201d ) or\nShanghai Clearing House ( \u201c SHCH \u201d ) will deliver bonds according to the instructions sent by the parties.\nFunds clearing banks will handle the transfer and settlement of the payments of the bonds on behalf of the\nparties. The China Foreign Exchange Trading System is the unified trading platform for CIBM. A Fund's\ninvestments in China bonds through the CIBM Direct Access Program will be subject to a number of additional\nrisks and restrictions that may affect the Fund's investments and returns. Certain of these risks are\ndiscussed below. The CIBM Direct Access Program is relatively new. Laws, rules, regulations, policies,\nnotices, circulars or guidelines relating to the CIBM Direct Access Program as published or applied by the\nPBOC and other PRC authorities are relatively untested and are subject to change from time to time. There\ncan be no assurance that the CIBM Direct Access Program will not be restricted, suspended or abolished. If\nsuch event occurs, a Fund's ability to invest in the CIBM through the CIBM Direct Access Program will be\nadversely affected, and if the Fund is unable to adequately access the CIBM through other means, the Fund's\nability to achieve its investment objective will be adversely affected. Under the prevailing PRC\nregulations, eligible foreign institutional investors who wish to invest directly in CIBM through the CIBM\nDirect Access Program may do so through an onshore settlement agent, who would be responsible for making the\nrelevant filings and account opening with the relevant authorities. The Funds are therefore subject to the\nrisk of default or errors on the part of such agent. QFI Investment Risk: The Renminbi Qualified Foreign\nInstitutional Investor ( \u201c RQFII \u201d ) and Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor ( \u201c QFII \u201d ) regimes have\nbeen combined, effective May 2020, with a unified set of rules applicable to all RQFIIs and QFIIs by the\nChinese regulators (collectively referred to as \u201c Qualified Foreign Investor \u201d or \u201c QFI \u201d ) Investment\ncompanies, such as the Funds, are not currently within the types of entities that are eligible for QFI\nlicense. Rather, each Fund may utilize the Adviser's QFI license granted under QFI regulations to invest in\nChina bonds. It is possible that the Adviser's QFI status could be suspended or revoked. Pursuant to PRC and\nQFI regulations, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( \u201c SAFE \u201d ) and the China Securities\nRegulatory Commission ( \u201c CSRC \u201d ) are vested with the power to impose regulatory sanctions if the Adviser,\nin its capacity as QFI, or the PRC custodian violates any provision of the QFI regulations. Any such\nviolations could result in the revocation of the Adviser's QFI license or other regulatory sanctions and may\nadversely affect the ability of a Fund to invest in China bonds. The Adviser is also subject to regulation\nby certain Hong Kong regulatory authorities, including the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.\nRegulatory matters arising from such regulation could also adversely affect the Adviser's QFI license and\nability to provide advisory services, generally. There can be no assurance that the Adviser will continue to\nmaintain its QFI status. In the event the Adviser is unable to maintain its QFI status, it may be necessary\nfor the Fund to limit or suspend creations of Creation Units. In such event it is possible that the trading\nprice of the Fund's Shares on its Exchange will be at a significant premium to the NAV (which may also\nincrease tracking error of the Fund). In extreme circumstances, a Fund may incur significant loss due to\nlimited investment capabilities, or may not be able fully to implement or pursue its investment objectives\nor strategies, due to QFI investment restrictions, illiquidity of the PRC securities markets, and delay or\ndisruption in execution of trades or in settlement of trades. The regulations which regulate investments by\nQFIs in the PRC and the repatriation of capital from QFI investments are relatively new. The application and\ninterpretation of such investment regulations are therefore relatively untested and there is no certainty as\nto how they will be applied as the PRC authorities and regulators have been given wide discretion in\n\n18\n\nsuch investment regulations and there is no precedent or certainty as to how such discretion may be\nexercised now or in the future. Existing QFI regulations may change over time and new QFI regulations may be\npromulgated in the future and no assurance can be given that any such changes will not adversely affect a\nFund or its ability to achieve its investment objective. Bond Connect Risks: The \u201c Mutual Bond Market Access\nbetween Mainland China and Hong Kong \u201d ( \u201c Bond Connect \u201d ) program is a new initiative established by PBOC,\nChina Foreign Exchange Trade System & National Interbank Funding Centre ( \u201c CFETS \u201d ), CCDC, SHCH, and Hong\nKong Exchanges and Clearing Limited ( \u201c HKEx \u201d ) and Central Moneymarkets Unit ( \u201c CMU \u201d ) of the Hong Kong\nMonetary Authority ( \u201c HKMA \u201d ) to facilitate investor's investments between the Mainland China and Hong\nKong bond markets through connection between the Mainland China and Hong Kong financial institutions. Under\nthe prevailing PRC regulations, eligible foreign investors are allowed to invest in the bonds available on\nthe CIBM through the northbound trading of Bond Connect ( \u201c Northbound Trading Link \u201d ). There is currently\nno investment quota for the Northbound Trading Link. The Northbound Trading Link refers to the trading\nplatform that is located outside of Mainland China and is connected to CFETS for eligible foreign investors\nto submit their trade requests for bonds circulated in the CIBM through Bond Connect. HKEx and CFETS work\ntogether with offshore electronic bond trading platforms to provide electronic trading services and\nplatforms to allow direct trading between eligible foreign investors and approved onshore dealers in\nMainland China through CFETS. Under the Northbound Trading Link, eligible foreign investors are required to\nappoint the CFETS or other institutions recognized by the PBOC as registration agents to apply for\nregistration with the PBOC. Pursuant to the prevailing regulations in Mainland China, the CMU, the offshore\ncustody agent recognized by the HKMA, opens omnibus nominee accounts with the onshore custody agent\nrecognized by the PBOC (i.e., the CCDC and SHCH). All bonds traded by eligible foreign investors will be\nregistered in the name of the CMU, which will hold such bonds as a nominee owner. Bond Connect is relatively\nnew. Laws, rules, regulations, policies, notices, circulars or guidelines relating to Bond Connect as\npublished or applied by any of the Bond Connect Authorities (as defined below) are relatively untested and\nare subject to change. \u201c Bond Connect Authorities \u201d refers to the exchanges, trading systems, settlement\nsystems, governmental, regulatory or tax bodies which provide services and/or regulate Bond Connect and\nactivities relating to Bond Connect, including, without limitation, the PBOC, the HKMA, the HKEx, the CFETS,\nthe CMU, the CCDC and the SHCH and any other regulator, agency or authority with jurisdiction, authority or\nresponsibility in respect of Bond Connect. There can be no assurance that Bond Connect will not be\nrestricted, suspended or abolished. If such event occurs, a Fund's ability to invest in the CIBM through\nBond Connect may be adversely affected, and if the Fund is unable to adequately access the CIBM through\nother means, the Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective may be adversely affected. Under the\nprevailing Bond Connect regulations, eligible foreign investors who wish to participate in Bond Connect may\ndo so through an offshore custody agent, registration agent or other third parties (as the case may be), who\nwould be responsible for making the relevant filings and account opening with the relevant authorities. A\nFund is therefore subject to the risk of default or errors on the part of such agents. Trading through Bond\nConnect is performed through newly developed trading platforms and operational systems. There is no\nassurance that such systems will function properly (in particular, under extreme market conditions) or will\ncontinue to be adapted to changes and developments in the market. In the event that the relevant systems\nfail to function properly, trading through Bond Connect may be disrupted. A Fund's ability to trade through\nBond Connect (and hence to pursue its investment strategy) may therefore be adversely affected. In addition,\nwhere a Fund invests in the CIBM through Bond Connect, it may be subject to risks of delays inherent in the\norder placing and/or settlement. The CMU is the \u201c nominee holder \u201d of the bonds acquired by a Fund through\nBond Connect. While Bond Connect Authorities have expressly stated that investors will enjoy the rights and\ninterests of the bonds acquired through Bond Connect similar to investors in bond interests acquired through\nmore traditional means in accordance with applicable laws, the exercise and the enforcement of beneficial\nownership rights in such bonds in the Chinese courts has yet to be tested. As a result, for example, though\nthe HKMA has stated otherwise in its Frequently Asked Questions relating to Bond Connect, it is possible\nthat in the event that the nominee holder becomes insolvent, such bonds may be deemed to form part of the\npool of assets of the nominee holder available for distribution to its creditors thereby subjugating the\nrights of a Fund.\n\n19\n\nChinese Credit Rating Risks: China bonds will generally be rated by Chinese ratings agencies (and not by\nU.S. nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations ( \u201c NRSROs \u201d )). The rating criteria and\nmethodology used by Chinese rating agencies may be different from those adopted by NRSROs and international\ncredit rating agencies. Therefore, such rating systems may not provide an equivalent standard for comparison\nwith securities rated by NRSROs and international credit rating agencies. Market Risks: A Fund investing in\nthe CIBM will be subject to liquidity and volatility risks. Market volatility and potential lack of\nliquidity due to possible low trading volume of certain bonds in the CIBM may result in prices of certain\nbonds traded in the CIBM fluctuating significantly. The bid and offer spreads of the prices of such bonds\nmay be large, and a Fund may therefore incur significant trading and realization costs and may even suffer\nlosses when selling such investments. To the extent that a Fund transacts in the CIBM, the Fund may also be\nexposed to risks associated with settlement procedures and default of counterparties. The counterparty which\nhas entered into a transaction with a Fund may default in its obligation to settle the transaction by\nfailure to deliver relevant securities or to make payment. General PRC-Related Risks Economic, Political and\nSocial Risks of the PRC: The economy of China, which has been in a state of transition from a planned\neconomy to a more market-oriented economy, differs from the economies of most developed countries in many\nrespects, including the level of government involvement, its state of development, its growth rate, control\nof foreign exchange, protection of intellectual property rights and allocation of resources. Although the\nmajority of productive assets in China are still owned by the PRC government at various levels, in recent\nyears, the PRC government has implemented economic reform measures emphasizing utilization of market forces\nin the development of the economy of China and a high level of management autonomy. The economy of China has\nexperienced significant growth in the past several decades, but growth has been uneven both geographically\nand among various sectors of the economy, and no assurance can be given that such growth will continue.\nEconomic growth has also been accompanied by periods of high inflation. The PRC government has implemented\nvarious measures from time to time to control inflation and restrain the rate of economic growth. There can,\nhowever, be no assurance that the PRC government will continue to pursue such economic policies or, if it\ndoes, that those policies will continue to be successful. Any such adjustment and modification of those\neconomic policies may have an adverse impact on the securities markets in the PRC as well as the portfolio\nsecurities of a Fund. Further, the PRC government may from time to time adopt corrective measures to control\nthe growth of the PRC economy, which may also have an adverse impact on the capital growth and performance\nof a Fund. Political changes, social instability and adverse diplomatic developments in the PRC could result\nin the imposition of additional government restrictions, including expropriation of assets, confiscatory\ntaxes, limits on repatriation, or nationalization of some or all of the property held by the underlying\nissuers of a Fund's portfolio securities. PRC Laws and Regulations Risk: The regulatory and legal framework\nfor capital markets and companies in the PRC may not be as well developed as those of developed countries.\nPRC laws and regulations affecting securities markets are relatively new and evolving, and because of the\nlimited volume of published cases and judicial interpretation and their non-binding nature, interpretation\nand enforcement of these regulations involve significant uncertainties. In addition, as the PRC legal system\ndevelops, no assurance can be given that changes in such laws and regulations or new laws, regulations or\npractices relating to transactions in Chinese securities will be promulgated, or that their interpretation\nor enforcement will not have a material adverse effect on a Fund's portfolio securities. In addition, the\neffect of future developments in the PRC legal system is unpredictable, such as changes to the existing\nregulatory environment and government scrutiny in certain areas, uncertain interpretation and implementation\nof existing laws or enforcement thereof, or the preemption of local regulations by national laws. For\ninstance, China has tightened regulatory requirements with respect to privacy, data protection and\ninformation security, and has promulgated new regulations and policy to regulate certain industries in the\npast year, which may in turn impact the business operation of the underlying issuers of a Fund's portfolio\nsecurities. The rapid evolving legal system of China may have a material adverse effect on a Fund's\nportfolio securities. PRC Tax Risk: Uncertainties in PRC tax rules governing taxation of income and gains\nfrom investments in China bonds could result in unexpected tax liabilities for a Fund. A Fund's investments\nin China bonds may cause the Fund to become subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by the PRC. The\nMinistry of Finance of the PRC and the State Administration of Taxation of the PRC issued Caishui No. 108 on\nNovember 7, 2018, which states that bond interests derived from investment in the China bond market\n(including through CIBM, a QFI license or Bond Connect) by foreign investors will be temporarily exempt from\nwithholding income tax and value added tax. According to the Announcement on\n\n20\n\nContinuation of Corporate Income Tax and Value-added Tax Policies for Overseas Institutions Investing in the\nDomestic Bond Market (Announcement [2021] No. 34), which was jointly made by the Ministry of Finance and the\nState Administration of Taxation on November 22, 2021, the temporary exemption applies to the withholding\ntax and value-added tax on bond interest derived from investment in the China bond market by foreign\ninstitutional investors and will continue until December 31, 2025. If, in the future, China begins applying\ntax rules regarding the taxation of investment in China bonds by foreign investors, and/or begins collecting\nwithholding and other taxes on interest derived by such investment, a Fund's return might be adversely\naffected. Political Tension Risk: Recently there have been heightened tensions in international economic\nrelations and rising political tensions. In particular, political tensions between the United States and\nChina have escalated due to, among other things, trade disputes, the COVID-19 outbreak, sanctions imposed by\nthe U.S. Department of Treasury on certain officials of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the\nPRC central government, as well as retaliatory actions of the PRC government. Rising political tensions\ncould reduce levels of trade, investments and other economic activities between the two major economies, and\nany escalation thereof may have a negative impact on the general, economic, political, and social conditions\nin China and, in turn, adversely impact a Fund's portfolio securities. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK An\ninvestment in a Fund may be subject to a number of actual or potential conflicts of interest. For example,\nthe Adviser or its affiliates may provide services to a Fund, such as securities lending agency services,\ncustodial, administrative, bookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer agency and shareholder servicing,\nsecurities brokerage services, and other services for which the Fund would compensate the Adviser and/or\nsuch affiliates. A Fund may invest in other pooled investment vehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise\naffiliated with the Adviser. There is no assurance that the rates at which a Fund pays fees or expenses to\nthe Adviser or its affiliates, or the terms on which it enters into transactions with the Adviser or its\naffiliates, will be the most favorable available in the market generally or as favorable as the rates the\nAdviser makes available to other clients. Because of its financial interest, the Adviser may have an\nincentive to enter into transactions or arrangements on behalf of a Fund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so in the absence of that interest. CONTINUOUS OFFERING The\nmethod by which Creation Units of Shares are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units of Shares are issued and sold by the Trust on an ongoing basis,\nat any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as such term is used in the Securities Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result\nin their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which could render them statutory\nunderwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units\nafter placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent Shares, and sells such Shares\ndirectly to customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new Shares with an active\nselling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for Shares. A determination of whether one\nis an underwriter for purposes of the Securities Act must take into account all the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and the examples\nmentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a\ncategorization as an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions in Shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of\nShares, are generally required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in\nSection 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus-delivery obligation with respect to Shares of a\nFund are reminded that under Securities Act Rule 153, a prospectus-delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2)\nof the Securities Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Exchange is satisfied by\nthe fact that a Fund's Prospectus is available at the Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery\nmechanism provided in Rule 153 is only available with respect to transactions on an exchange.\n\n21\n\nSSGA or its affiliates (the \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d ) may purchase Creation Units through a broker-dealer to\n\u201c seed \u201d (in whole or in part) Funds as they are launched, or may purchase shares from broker-dealers or\nother investors that have previously provided \u201c seed \u201d for a Fund when it was launched or otherwise in\nsecondary market transactions, and because the Selling Shareholder may be deemed an affiliate of such Funds,\nthe Shares are being registered to permit the resale of these shares from time to time after purchase. The\nFunds will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the Selling Shareholders of these Shares. The\nSelling Shareholder intends to sell all or a portion of the Shares owned by it and offered hereby from time\nto time directly or through one or more broker-dealers, and may also hedge such positions. The Shares may be\nsold on any national securities exchange on which the Shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, in\nthe over-the-counter market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at\nprevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at\nnegotiated prices. These sales may be effected in transactions, which may involve cross or block\ntransactions. The Selling Shareholder may also loan or pledge Shares to broker-dealers that in turn may sell\nsuch Shares, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The Selling Shareholder may also enter into options\nor other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more\nderivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of\nShares, which Shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell. The Selling Shareholder\nand any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of Shares may be deemed to be \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act in connection with such sales.\nIn such event, any commissions paid to any such broker-dealer or agent and any profit on the resale of the\nShares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.\nThe Selling Shareholder who may be deemed an \u201c underwriter \u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the\nSecurities Act will be subject to the applicable prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act.\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK Counterparty risk with respect to derivatives has been and may continue to be affected by\nnew rules and regulations affecting the derivatives market. Some derivatives transactions are required to be\ncentrally cleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives transaction is subject to the credit risk of the\nclearing house and the clearing member through which it holds its cleared position, rather than the credit\nrisk of its original counterparty to the derivatives transaction. Credit risk of market participants with\nrespect to derivatives that are centrally cleared is concentrated in a few clearing houses, and it is not\nclear how an insolvency proceeding of a clearing house would be conducted, what effect the insolvency\nproceeding would have on any recovery by a Fund, and what impact an insolvency of a clearing house would\nhave on the financial system more generally. FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS There can be no assurance that\na liquid secondary market will exist for any particular futures contract or option at any specific time.\nThus, it may not be possible to close a futures or options position. In the event of adverse price\nmovements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin.\nIn such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily\nmargin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be required\nto make delivery of the instruments underlying futures contracts it has sold. Each Fund will minimize the\nrisk that it will be unable to close out a futures or options contract by only entering into futures and\noptions for which there appears to be a liquid secondary market. The risk of loss in trading futures\ncontracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (e.g., selling uncovered index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts, when available, in this\nmanner. The risk of a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin\ndeposits required. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in\nimmediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative to the size of a required margin deposit. A\nFund, however, may utilize futures and options contracts in a manner designed to limit its risk exposure to\nthat which is comparable to what it would have incurred through direct investment in securities.\n\n22\n\nUtilization of futures transactions by a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to\nits benchmark Index if the index underlying the futures contracts differs from the benchmark Index or if the\nfutures contracts do not track the benchmark Index as expected. There is also the risk of loss by a Fund of\nmargin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures\ncontract or option. Certain financial futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract prices during a single trading day. The \u201c daily price fluctuation limit \u201d or \u201c daily limit \u201d\nestablishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the\nprevious day's settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a\nparticular type of contract, generally no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. The\ndaily limit governs only price movement during a particular trading day and therefore does not limit\npotential losses, because the limit may prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions. Futures contract\nprices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no\ntrading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and subjecting some futures traders to\nsubstantial losses. RISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap\ncounterparty will default on its obligations. If such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual\nremedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction, but such remedies may be subject to\nbankruptcy and insolvency laws which could affect the Fund's rights as a creditor. The use of interest-rate\nand index swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different\nfrom those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. The use of a swap requires an\nunderstanding not only of the referenced asset, reference rate, or index, but also of the swap itself,\nwithout the benefit of observing the performance of the swap under all possible market conditions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets or principal.\nThe absence of a regulated execution facility or contract market and lack of liquidity for swap transactions\nhas led, in some instances, to difficulties in trading and valuation, especially in the event of market\ndisruptions. Under recently adopted rules and regulations, transactions in some types of swaps are required\nto be centrally cleared. In a cleared derivatives transaction, a Fund's counterparty to the transaction is a\ncentral derivatives clearing organization, or clearing house, rather than a bank or broker. Because the\nFunds are not members of a clearing house, and only members of a clearing house can participate directly in\nthe clearing house, each Fund holds cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. In cleared\nderivatives transactions, a Fund will make payments (including margin payments) to and receive payments from\na clearing house through its accounts at clearing members. Clearing members guarantee performance of their\nclients' obligations to the clearing house. Centrally cleared derivative arrangements may be less favorable\nto a Fund than bilateral (non-cleared) arrangements. For example, a Fund may be required to provide greater\namounts of margin for cleared derivatives transactions than for bilateral derivatives transactions. Also, in\ncontrast to bilateral derivatives transactions, in some cases following a period of notice to a Fund, a\nclearing member generally can require termination of existing cleared derivatives transactions at any time\nor an increase in margin requirements above the margin that the clearing member required at the beginning of\na transaction. Clearing houses also have broad rights to increase margin requirements for existing\ntransactions or to terminate transactions at any time in accordance with their rules. A Fund is subject to\nrisk if it enters into a derivatives transaction that is required to be cleared (or which SSGA FM expects to\nbe cleared), and no clearing member is willing or able to clear the transaction on the Fund's behalf. In\nthat case, the transaction might have to be terminated, and the Fund could lose some or all of the benefit\nof the transaction, including loss of an increase in the value of the transaction and loss of hedging\nprotection. In addition, the documentation governing the relationship between a Fund and clearing members is\ndrafted by the clearing members and generally is less favorable to the Fund than typical bilateral\nderivatives documentation. These clearing rules and other new rules and regulations could, among other\nthings, restrict a Fund's ability to engage in, or increase the cost to the Fund of, derivatives\ntransactions, for example, by making some types of derivatives no longer available to the Fund, increasing\nmargin or capital requirements, or otherwise limiting liquidity or increasing transaction costs. These\nregulations, as applicable to swaps, are relatively new and evolving, so their potential impact on a Fund\nand the financial system are not yet known.\n\n23\n\nBecause they are two party contracts that may be subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and\ntermination and because they may have terms of greater than seven days, swap agreements may be considered to\nbe illiquid and subject to a Fund's limitation on investments in illiquid investments. To the extent that a\nswap is not liquid, it may not be possible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position at an\nadvantageous time or price, which may result in significant losses. Like most other investments, swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the market value of the instrument will change in a way detrimental\nto a Fund's interest. If a Fund uses a swap as a hedge against, or as a substitute for, a portfolio\ninvestment, the Fund will be exposed to the risk that the swap will have or will develop imperfect or no\ncorrelation with the portfolio investment. This could cause substantial losses for the Fund. While hedging\nstrategies involving swap instruments can reduce the risk of loss, they can also reduce the opportunity for\ngain or even result in losses by offsetting favorable price movements in other Fund investments. Many swaps\nare complex and often valued subjectively. EUROPE \u2013 RECENT EVENTS A number of countries in Europe, including\nGreece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal, have substantial government debt levels. The concern over these\ndebt levels has led to volatility in the European financial markets, which has adversely affected the\nexchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect every country in Europe. For some\ncountries, the ability to repay sovereign debt is in question, and default is possible, which could affect\ntheir ability to borrow in the future. Several countries have agreed to multi-year bailout loans from the\nEuropean Central Bank, the IMF, and other institutions. A default or debt restructuring by any European\ncountry can adversely impact holders of that country's debt and can affect exposures to other European Union\n( \u201c EU \u201d ) countries and their financial companies as well. These financial difficulties may continue,\nworsen or spread within or outside Europe. Responses to the financial problems by European governments,\ncentral banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not work, may result in social\nunrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences.\nUncertainties regarding the viability of the EU have impacted and may continue to impact markets in the\nUnited States and around the world. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU\n(commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and entered an 11-month transition period. The transition period\nconcluded on December 31, 2020, and the United Kingdom left the EU single market and customs union under the\nterms of a new trade agreement. The agreement governs the new relationship between the United Kingdom and EU\nwith respect to trading goods and services, but critical aspects of the relationship remain unresolved and\nsubject to further negotiation and agreement. Certain aspects of Brexit have had an adverse impact on the\nregion, leading to increased inflation, labor shortages and business closures, among others. The full scope\nand nature of the consequences of the exit are not at this time known and are unlikely to be known for a\nsignificant period of time. It is also unknown whether the United Kingdom's exit will increase the\nlikelihood of other countries also departing the EU. Any additional exits from the EU, or the possibility of\nsuch exits, may have a significant impact on the United Kingdom, Europe, and global economies, which may\nresult in increased volatility and illiquidity, new legal and regulatory uncertainties and potentially lower\neconomic growth for such economies that could potentially have an adverse effect on the value of a Fund's\ninvestments. LIBOR RISK The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was a leading benchmark or reference rate\nfor various commercial and financial contracts, including corporate and municipal bonds, bank loans, asset-\nbacked and mortgage-related securities, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. On July 27, 2017, the\nUnited Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced the gradual phase out\nof the LIBOR rate, with nearly all LIBOR rate publications having ceased as of June 30, 2023 (some LIBOR\nrates continue to be published, but only on a temporary and synthetic basis). Alternatives to LIBOR have\nbeen established and others may be developed. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative\nReference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has\nidentified the Secured Overnight Financial Rate (SOFR) as the preferred alternative rate to LIBOR. SOFR is a\nrelatively new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. There\nremains uncertainty surrounding the nature of any replacement rates. The transition to a new reference rate\nmay result in (i) increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments or contracts that\npreviously relied on or still rely on LIBOR, (ii) a reduction in the value of certain instruments or\ncontracts held by a Fund, (iii) reduced effectiveness of related Fund transactions, such as hedging, (iv)\nadditional tax, accounting and regulatory risks, or (v) costs incurred in connection with closing out\npositions and entering into new trades. Any pricing\n\n24\n\nadjustments to a Fund's investments resulting from a substitute reference rate may also adversely affect a\nFund's performance and/or NAV. There is no assurance that the composition or characteristics of any such\nalternative reference rate will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR or\nthat instruments or contracts using an alternative rate will have the same volume or liquidity. MARKET\nTURBULENCE RESULTING FROM INFECTIOUS ILLNESS A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as\nCOVID-19, may lead to governments and businesses world-wide taking aggressive measures, including closing\nborders, restricting international and domestic travel, and the imposition of prolonged quarantines of large\npopulations. As occurred in the wake of COVID-19, the spread of such an illness may result in the disruption\nof and delays in the delivery of healthcare services and processes, the cancellation of organized events and\neducational institutions, the disruption of production and supply chains, a decline in consumer demand for\ncertain goods and services, and general concern and uncertainty, all of which may contribute to increased\nvolatility in global markets. COVID-19, and other epidemics and pandemics that may arise in the future,\ncould adversely affect the economies of many nations, the global economy, individual companies, sectors and\nindustries, and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen at the present time. In addition, the impact\nof infectious diseases in developing or emerging market countries may be greater due to limited health care\nresources. Political, economic and social stresses caused by infectious illness also may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries. The duration of such an illness and\nits effects cannot be determined at this time, but the effects could be present for an extended period of\ntime. RUSSIA SANCTIONS RISK Sanctions threatened or imposed by a number of jurisdictions, including the\nUnited States, the European Union and the United Kingdom, and other intergovernmental actions that have been\nor may be undertaken in the future, against Russia, Russian entities or Russian individuals, may result in\nthe devaluation of Russian currency, a downgrade in the country's credit rating, an immediate freeze of\nRussian assets, a decline in the value and liquidity of Russian securities, property or interests, and/or\nother adverse consequences to the Russian economy or a Fund. The scope and scale of sanctions in place at a\nparticular time may be expanded or otherwise modified in a way that have negative effects on a Fund.\nSanctions, or the threat of new or modified sanctions, could impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell,\nhold, receive, deliver or otherwise transact in certain affected securities or other investment instruments.\nSanctions could also result in Russia taking counter measures or other actions in response, which may\nfurther impair the value and liquidity of Russian securities. These sanctions, and the resulting disruption\nof the Russian economy, may cause volatility in other regional and global markets and may negatively impact\nthe performance of various sectors and industries, as well as companies in other countries, which could have\na negative effect on the performance of a Fund, even if a Fund does not have direct exposure to securities\nof Russian issuers. As a collective result of the imposition of sanctions, Russian government\ncountermeasures and the impact that they have had on the trading markets for Russian securities, certain\nFunds have used, and may in the future use, fair valuation procedures approved by the Fund's Board to value\ncertain Russian securities, which could result in such securities being deemed to have a zero value. A\nreduction in liquidity of certain Fund holdings as a result of sanctions and related actions may cause a\nFund to experience increased premiums or discounts to its NAV and/or wider bid-ask spreads. Additionally, if\nit becomes impracticable or unlawful for a Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by,\nsanctions, or if deemed appropriate by the Fund's investment adviser, the Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits\nof the affected securities in connection with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit,\nwhich may also increase the Fund's transaction costs. TAX RISKS As with any investment, you should consider\nhow your investment in Shares of a Fund will be taxed. The tax information in the Prospectus and this SAI is\nprovided as general information. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of\nan investment in Shares of a Fund. Unless your investment in Shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or\ntax-advantaged retirement account, such as an individual retirement account, you need to be aware of the\npossible tax consequences when a Fund makes distributions or you sell Shares.\n\n25\n\nInvestment Restrictions The Trust has adopted the following investment restrictions as fundamental policies\nwith respect to each Fund. These restrictions cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of a\nmajority of a Fund's outstanding voting securities. For purposes of the 1940 Act, a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of a Fund means the vote, at an annual or a special meeting of the security\nholders of the Trust, of the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the voting securities of the Fund present at such\nmeeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present or\nrepresented by proxy, or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Except with the\napproval of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, each Fund may not: 1. Concentrate its\ninvestments in securities of issuers in the same industry, except as may be necessary to approximate the\ncomposition of the Fund's underlying Index; (1) 2. Make loans to another person except as permitted by the\n1940 Act or other governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund; 3. Issue senior securities or borrow money except as permitted by the 1940 Act or\nother governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory agency with authority\nover the Fund; 4. Invest directly in real estate unless the real estate is acquired as a result of ownership\nof securities or other instruments. This restriction shall not preclude the Fund from investing in companies\nthat deal in real estate or in instruments that are backed or secured by real estate; 5. Act as an\nunderwriter of another issuer's securities, except to the extent the Fund may be deemed to be an underwriter\nwithin the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with the Fund's purchase and sale of portfolio\nsecurities; or 6. Invest in commodities except as permitted by the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by\nthe Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund. In addition to\nthe investment restrictions adopted as fundamental policies as set forth above, each Fund observes the\nfollowing restrictions, which may be changed by the Board without a shareholder vote. Each Fund will not: 1.\nInvest in the securities of a company for the purpose of exercising management or control, provided that the\nTrust may vote the investment securities owned by the Fund in accordance with its views; or 2. With respect\nto each Fund, under normal circumstances, invest less than 80% of its total assets in securities that\ncomprise its relevant Index. Securities that have economic characteristics substantially identical to the\neconomic characteristics of the securities that comprise the Index are included within this 80% investment\npolicy. 3. With respect to the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International\nGovernment Inflation-Protected Bond ETF, under normal circumstances, invest less than 80% of its net assets,\nplus the amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in debt securities. Prior to any change in a Fund's\n80% investment policy, the Fund will provide shareholders with 60 days written notice. 4. With respect to\nthe SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF, invest, under normal circumstances, less than 80% of\nits net assets, plus the amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in corporate bonds. Prior to any\nchange in this 80% investment policy, the Fund will provide shareholders with 60 days written notice. 5.\nWith respect to the SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF and SPDR Bloomberg Short Term\nInternational Treasury Bond ETF, under normal circumstances, invest less than 80% of its net assets, plus\nthe amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in government bonds. Prior to any change in the Fund's 80%\ninvestment policy, the Fund will provide shareholders with 60 days written notice. The Funds define the\nforegoing terms in accordance with the definition of such terms per the applicable Index. If a percentage\nlimitation is adhered to at the time of investment or contract, a later increase or decrease in percentage\nresulting from any change in value or total or net assets will not result in a violation of such\nrestriction, except that the percentage limitations with respect to the borrowing of money will be observed\ncontinuously. With respect to the limitation on borrowing, in the event that a subsequent change in net\nassets or other circumstances cause a Fund to exceed its limitation, the Fund will take steps to bring the\naggregate amount of borrowing back within the limitations within three days thereafter (not including\nSundays and holidays).\n\n(1) The SEC Staff considers concentration to involve more than 25% of a fund's assets to be invested in an\nindustry or group of industries.\n\n26\n\nThe 1940 Act currently permits each Fund to loan up to 33 1/3% of its total assets. With respect to\nborrowing, the 1940 Act presently allows each Fund to: (1) borrow from any bank (including pledging,\nmortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total assets, (2) borrow money for\ntemporary purposes in an amount not exceeding 5% of the value of the Fund's total assets at the time of the\nloan, and (3) enter into reverse repurchase agreements. However, under normal circumstances any borrowings\nby a Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. The 1940 Act generally prohibits funds from\nissuing senior securities, although it does not treat certain transactions as senior securities, such as\ncertain borrowings, with appropriate asset coverage. With respect to investments in commodities, the 1940\nAct presently permits the Funds to invest in commodities in accordance with investment policies contained in\nits prospectus and SAI. Any such investment shall also comply with the CEA and the rules and regulations\nthereunder. The 1940 Act does not directly restrict an investment company's ability to invest in real\nestate, but does require that every investment company have the fundamental investment policy governing such\ninvestments. The Funds will not purchase or sell real estate, except that a Fund may invest in companies\nthat deal in real estate (including REITs) or in instruments that are backed or secured by real estate.\nExchange Listing and Trading A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters associated with an\ninvestment in a Fund is contained in the Prospectus under \u201c PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION \u201d and \u201c ADDITIONAL\nPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with,\nsuch sections of the Prospectus. The Shares of each Fund are approved for listing and trading on the\nExchange, subject to notice of issuance. Shares trade on the Exchange at prices that may differ to some\ndegree from their net asset value. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary\nto maintain the listing of Shares of a Fund will continue to be met. The Exchange may consider the\nsuspension of trading in, and may initiate delisting proceedings of, the Shares of a Fund under any of the\nfollowing circumstances: (i) if the Exchange becomes aware that the Fund is no longer eligible to operate in\nreliance on Rule 6c-11 under the 1940 Act; (ii) if the Fund no longer complies with the applicable listing\nrequirements set forth in the Exchange's rules; (iii) if, following the initial twelve-month period after\ncommencement of trading on the Exchange of the Fund, there are fewer than 50 beneficial holders of the Fund;\nor (iv) if such other event shall occur or condition exists which, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes\nfurther dealings on the Exchange inadvisable. The Exchange will remove the Shares from listing and trading\nupon termination of a Fund. The Trust reserves the right to adjust the Share price of a Fund in the future\nto maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock\nsplits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect on the net assets of the Fund or an investor's\nequity interest in the Fund. As in the case of other publicly traded securities, brokers' commissions on\ntransactions will be based on negotiated commission rates at customary levels. The base and trading\ncurrencies of each Fund is the U.S. dollar. The base currency is the currency in which a Fund's net asset\nvalue per Share is calculated and the trading currency is the currency in which Shares of a Fund are listed\nand traded on the Exchange. Management of the Trust The following information supplements and should be read\nin conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c MANAGEMENT. \u201d BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES The\nmanagement and affairs of the Trust and its series, including the Funds described in this SAI, are overseen\nby the Trustees. The Board has approved contracts, as described in this SAI, under which certain companies\nprovide essential management services to the Trust. Like most mutual funds, the day-to-day business of the\nTrust, including the management of risk, is performed by third party service providers, such as the Adviser,\nDistributor, Administrator, and Sub-Administrator. The Trustees are responsible for overseeing the Trust's\nservice providers and, thus, have oversight responsibility with respect to risk management performed by\nthose service providers. Risk management seeks to identify and address risks, i.e ., events or circumstances\nthat could have material adverse effects on the business, operations, shareholder services, investment\n\n27\n\nperformance or reputation of the Funds. The Funds and their service providers employ a variety of processes,\nprocedures and controls to identify various of those possible events or circumstances, to lessen the\nprobability of their occurrence and/or to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances if they do\noccur. Each service provider is responsible for one or more discrete aspects of the Trust's business and,\nconsequently, for managing the risks associated with that business. The Board has emphasized to the Funds'\nservice providers the importance of maintaining vigorous risk management. The Trustees' role in risk\noversight begins before the inception of a Fund, at which time the Fund's Adviser presents the Board with\ninformation concerning the investment objectives, strategies and risks of the Fund, as well as proposed\ninvestment limitations for the Fund. Additionally, the Fund's Adviser provides the Board with an overview\nof, among other things, their investment philosophies, brokerage practices and compliance infrastructures.\nThereafter, the Board continues its oversight function as various personnel, including the Trust's Chief\nCompliance Officer, as well as personnel of the Adviser and other service providers, such as the Fund's\nindependent accountants, make periodic reports to the Audit Committee or to the Board with respect to\nvarious aspects of risk management. The Board and the Audit Committee oversee efforts by management and\nservice providers to manage risks to which a Fund may be exposed. The Board is responsible for overseeing\nthe nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the Funds by the Adviser and receives information\nabout those services at its regular meetings. In addition, on an annual basis, in connection with its\nconsideration of whether to renew the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser, the Board meets with\nthe Adviser to review such services. Among other things, the Board regularly considers the Adviser's\nadherence to each Fund's investment restrictions and compliance with various Fund policies and procedures\nand with applicable securities regulations. The Board also reviews information about each Fund's\ninvestments. The Trust's Chief Compliance Officer reports regularly to the Board to review and discuss\ncompliance issues. At least annually, the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer provides the Board with a report\nreviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the Trust's policies and procedures and those of its service\nproviders, including the Adviser. The report addresses the operation of the policies and procedures of the\nTrust and each service provider since the date of the last report; any material changes to the policies and\nprocedures since the date of the last report; any recommendations for material changes to the policies and\nprocedures; and any material compliance matters since the date of the last report. The Board receives\nreports from the Funds' service providers regarding operational risks and risks related to the valuation and\nliquidity of portfolio securities. Regular reports are made to the Board concerning investments for which\nmarket quotations are not readily available. Annually, the independent registered public accounting firm\nreviews with the Audit Committee its audit of each Fund's financial statements, focusing on major areas of\nrisk encountered by the Fund and noting any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Fund's\ninternal controls. Additionally, in connection with its oversight function, the Board oversees Fund\nmanagement's implementation of disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports with the SEC are recorded,\nprocessed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods. The Board also oversees the Trust's\ninternal controls over financial reporting, which comprise policies and procedures designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Trust's financial reporting and the preparation of the\nTrust's financial statements. From their review of these reports and discussions with the Adviser, the Chief\nCompliance Officer, the independent registered public accounting firm and other service providers, the Board\nand the Audit Committee learn in detail about the material risks of the Funds, thereby facilitating a\ndialogue about how management and service providers identify and mitigate those risks. The Board recognizes\nthat not all risks that may affect a Fund can be identified and/or quantified, that it may not be practical\nor cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary to bear certain risks\n(such as investment-related risks) to achieve a Fund's goals, and that the processes, procedures and\ncontrols employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness. Moreover, reports received\nby the Trustees as to risk management matters are typically summaries of the relevant information. Most of\nthe Funds' investment management and business affairs are carried out by or through a Fund's Adviser and\nother service providers, each of which has an independent interest in risk management but whose policies and\nthe methods by which one or more risk management functions are carried out may differ from the Funds' and\neach other's in the setting of priorities, the resources available or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Board's ability to monitor and manage risk, as\na practical matter, is subject to limitations.\n\n28\n\nTRUSTEES AND OFFICERS There are eight members of the Board of Trustees, six of whom are not interested\npersons of the Trust, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act ( \u201c Independent Trustees \u201d ). Carl\nVerboncoeur, an Independent Trustee, serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board has determined its\nleadership structure is appropriate given the specific characteristics and circumstances of the Trust. The\nBoard made this determination in consideration of, among other things, the fact that the Independent\nTrustees constitute a super-majority (75%) of the Board, the fact that the chairperson of each Committee of\nthe Board is an Independent Trustee, the amount of assets under management in the Trust, and the number of\nfunds overseen by the Board. The Board also believes that its leadership structure facilitates the orderly\nand efficient flow of information to the Independent Trustees from fund management. The Board of Trustees\nhas two standing committees: the Audit Committee and Trustee Committee. The Audit Committee and Trustee\nCommittee are each chaired by an Independent Trustee and composed of all of the Independent Trustees. Set\nforth below are the names, year of birth, position with the Trust, length of term of office, and the\nprincipal occupations during the last five years and other directorships held of each of the persons\ncurrently serving as a Trustee or Officer of the Trust.

The portfolio managers listed above\ndid not beneficially own any interests of any Fund as of December 31, 2023. Conflicts of Interest. A\nportfolio manager that has responsibility for managing more than one account may be subject to potential\nconflicts of interest because he or she is responsible for other accounts in addition to the Funds. Those\nconflicts could include preferential treatment of one account over others in terms of: (a) the portfolio\nmanager's execution of different investment strategies for various accounts; or (b) the allocation of\nresources or of investment opportunities. Portfolio managers may manage numerous accounts for multiple\nclients. These accounts may include registered investment companies, other types of pooled accounts (e.g.,\ncollective investment funds), and separate accounts (i.e., accounts managed on behalf of individuals or\npublic or private institutions). Portfolio managers make investment decisions for each account based on the\ninvestment objectives and policies and other relevant investment considerations applicable to that\nportfolio. A potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of a portfolio manager's responsibility\nfor multiple accounts with similar investment guidelines. Under these circumstances, a potential investment\nmay be suitable for more than one of the portfolio manager's accounts, but the quantity of the investment\navailable for purchase is less than the\n\n38\n\naggregate amount the accounts would ideally allocate to the opportunity. Similar conflicts may arise when\nmultiple accounts seek to dispose of the same investment. The portfolio managers may also manage accounts\nwhose objectives and policies differ from that of the Funds. These differences may be such that under\ncertain circumstances, trading activity appropriate for one account managed by the portfolio manager may\nhave adverse consequences for another account managed by the portfolio manager. For example, an account may\nsell a significant position in a security, which could cause the market price of that security to decrease,\nwhile a Fund maintained its position in that security. A potential conflict may arise when the portfolio\nmanagers are responsible for accounts that have different advisory fees\u2014 the difference in fees could create\nan incentive for the portfolio manager to favor one account over another, for example, in terms of access to\ninvestment opportunities. This conflict may be heightened if an account is subject to a performance-based\nfee, as applicable. Another potential conflict may arise when the portfolio manager has a personal\ninvestment in one or more accounts that participate in transactions with other accounts. His or her personal\ninvestment(s) may create an incentive for the portfolio manager to favor one account over another. The\nAdviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to address these potential material\nconflicts. For instance, portfolio managers are normally responsible for all accounts within a certain\ninvestment discipline and do not, absent special circumstances, differentiate among the various accounts\nwhen allocating resources. Additionally, the Adviser and its advisory affiliates have processes and\nprocedures for allocating investment opportunities among portfolios that are designed to provide a fair and\nequitable allocation. With respect to conflicts arising from personal investments, all employees, including\nportfolio managers, must comply with personal trading controls established by each of the Adviser's and\nTrust's Code of Ethics. SSGA's culture is complemented and reinforced by a total rewards strategy that is\nbased on a pay for performance philosophy which seeks to offer a competitive pay mix of base salary,\nbenefits, cash incentives and deferred compensation. Salary is based on a number of factors, including\nexternal benchmarking data and market trends, and performance both at the business and individual level.\nSSGA's Global Human Resources department regularly participates in compensation surveys in order to provide\nSSGA with market-based compensation information that helps support individual pay decisions. Additionally,\nsubject to State Street and SSGA business results, an incentive pool is allocated to SSGA to reward its\nemployees. The size of the incentive pool for most business units is based on the firm's overall\nprofitability and other factors, including performance against risk-related goals. For most SSGA investment\nteams, SSGA recognizes and rewards performance by linking annual incentive decisions for investment teams to\nthe firm's or business unit's profitability and business unit investment performance over a multi-year\nperiod. Incentive pool funding for most active investment teams is driven in part by the post-tax investment\nperformance of fund(s) managed by the team versus the return levels of the benchmark index(es) of the\nfund(s) on a one-, three- and, in some cases, five-year basis. For most active investment teams, a material\nportion of incentive compensation for senior staff is deferred over a four-year period into the SSGA Long-\nTerm Incentive ( \u201c SSGA LTI \u201d ) program. For these teams, The SSGA LTI program indexes the performance of\nthese deferred awards against the post-tax investment performance of fund(s) managed by the team. This is\nintended to align our investment team's compensation with client interests, both through annual incentive\ncompensation awards and through the long-term value of deferred awards in the SSGA LTI program. For the\nindex equity investment team, incentive pool funding is driven in part by the post-tax 1 and 3-year tracking\nerror of the funds managed by the team against the benchmark indexes of the funds. The discretionary\nallocation of the incentive pool to the business units within SSGA is influenced by market-based\ncompensation data, as well as the overall performance of each business unit. Individual compensation\ndecisions are made by the employee's manager, in conjunction with the senior management of the employee's\nbusiness unit. These decisions are based on the overall performance of the employee and, as mentioned above,\non the performance of the firm and business unit. Depending on the job level, a portion of the annual\nincentive may be awarded in deferred compensation, which may include cash and/or Deferred Stock Awards\n(State Street stock), which typically vest over a four-year period. This helps to retain staff and further\naligns SSGA employees' interests with SSGA clients' and shareholders' long-term interests. SSGA recognizes\nand rewards outstanding performance by: \u2022 Promoting employee ownership to connect employees directly to the\ncompany's success. \u2022 Using rewards to reinforce mission, vision, values and business strategy. \u2022 Seeking to\nrecognize and preserve the firm's unique culture and team orientation.\n\n39\n\n\u2022 Providing all employees the opportunity to share in the success of SSGA.

underwriter and\nDistributor of Shares. Its principal address is One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. Investor\ninformation can be obtained by calling 1-866-787-2257. The Distributor has entered into a distribution\nagreement ( \u201c Distribution Agreement \u201d ) with the Trust pursuant to which it distributes Shares of each\nFund. The Distribution Agreement will continue for two years from its effective date and is renewable\nannually thereafter. Shares will be continuously offered for sale by the Trust through the Distributor only\nin Creation Units, as described in the Prospectus and below under \u201c PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION\nUNITS. \u201d Shares in less than Creation Units are not distributed by the Distributor. The Distributor will\ndeliver the Prospectus to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both orders placed\nwith it and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it. The Distributor is a broker-dealer registered under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201c Exchange Act \u201d ) and a member of the Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority ( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor has no role in determining the investment\npolicies of the Trust or which securities are to be purchased or sold by the Trust. An affiliate of the\nDistributor may assist Authorized Participants (as defined below) in assembling shares to purchase Creation\nUnits or upon redemption, for which it may receive commissions or other fees from such Authorized\nParticipants. An affiliate of the Distributor also receives compensation from State Street for providing on-\nline creation and redemption functionality to Authorized Participants through its Fund Connect application.\nThe Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of the Adviser or Distributor, may directly or indirectly make\ncash payments to certain broker-dealers for participating in activities that are designed to make registered\nrepresentatives and other professionals more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the\nSPDR funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems.\nIn addition, as of the date of this SAI, the Adviser and/or Distributor had arrangements whereby they may\nmake payments, other than for the educational programs and marketing activities described above, to Pershing\nLLC ( \u201c Pershing \u201d ), RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( \u201c RBC \u201d ), LPL Financial, LLC ( \u201c LPL \u201d ), and Morgan\nStanley Wealth Management, LLC. These amounts, which may be significant, are paid by the Adviser and/or\nDistributor from their own resources and not from Fund assets. Pursuant to these arrangements, Pershing, RBC\nand LPL have agreed to offer certain SPDR funds to their customers and not to charge certain of their\ncustomers any commissions when those customers purchase or sell shares of certain SPDR funds. Payments to a\nbroker-dealer or intermediary may create potential conflicts of interest between the broker dealer or\nintermediary and its clients. In addition, the Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of the Adviser or\nDistributor, as well as an index provider that is not affiliated with the Adviser or Distributor, may\nreimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to other persons in consideration of services,\nprovision of data, or other activities that they believe may benefit the SPDR business or facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds. The Distribution Agreement provides that it may be terminated at any time, without\nthe payment of any penalty, as to a Fund: (i) by vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees or (ii) by\nvote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, on at\nleast 60 days' written notice to the Distributor. The Distribution Agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays' notice by the Distributor and will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined\nin the 1940 Act). The continuation of the Distribution Agreement and any other related agreements is subject\nto annual approval of the Board, including by a majority of the Independent Trustees, as described above.\nThe allocation among the Trust's series of fees and expenses payable under the Distribution Agreement will\nbe made pro rata in accordance with the daily net assets of the respective series. The Distributor may also\nenter into agreements with securities dealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers \u201d ) who will solicit purchases of\nCreation Unit aggregations of Shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Participating Parties (as defined\nin the \u201c Book Entry Only System \u201d section below) and/or DTC Participants (as defined below). Pursuant to the\nDistribution Agreement, the Trust has agreed to indemnify the Distributor, and may indemnify Soliciting\nDealers and Authorized Participants (as described below) entering into agreements with the Distributor, for\ncertain liabilities, including certain liabilities arising under the federal securities laws, unless such\nloss or liability results from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its\nduties or the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the Distribution Agreement or other\nagreement, as applicable.\n\n42\n\nBrokerage Transactions All portfolio transactions are placed on behalf of the Funds by the Adviser.\nPurchases and sales of securities on a securities exchange are affected through brokers who charge a\ncommission for their services. Ordinarily commissions are not charged on over-the-counter orders (e.g.,\nfixed income securities) because the Funds pay a spread which is included in the cost of the security and\nrepresents the difference between the dealer's quoted price at which it is willing to sell the security and\nthe dealer's quoted price at which it is willing to buy the security. When a Fund executes an over-the-\ncounter order with an electronic communications network or an alternative trading system, a commission is\ncharged by such electronic communications networks and alternative trading systems as they execute such\norders on an agency basis. Securities may be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting\nfees. In placing a portfolio transaction, the Adviser seeks to achieve best execution. The Adviser's duty to\nseek best execution requires the Adviser to take reasonable steps to obtain for the client as favorable an\noverall result as possible for Fund portfolio transactions under the circumstances, taking into account\nvarious factors that are relevant to the particular transaction. The Adviser refers to and selects from the\nlist of approved trading counterparties maintained by the Adviser's Credit Risk Management team. In\nselecting a trading counterparty for a particular trade, the Adviser seeks to weigh relevant factors\nincluding, but not limited to the following: \u2022 Prompt and reliable execution; \u2022 The competitiveness of\ncommission rates and spreads, if applicable; \u2022 The financial strength, stability and/or reputation of the\ntrading counterparty; \u2022 The willingness and ability of the executing trading counterparty to execute\ntransactions (and commit capital) of size in liquid and illiquid markets without disrupting the market for\nthe security; \u2022 Local laws, regulations or restrictions; \u2022 The ability of the trading counterparty to\nmaintain confidentiality; \u2022 The availability and capability of execution venues, including electronic\ncommunications networks for trading and execution management systems made available to Adviser; \u2022 Market\nshare; \u2022 Liquidity; \u2022 Price; \u2022 Execution related costs; \u2022 History of execution of orders; \u2022 Likelihood of\nexecution and settlement; \u2022 Order size and nature; \u2022 Clearance and settlement capabilities, especially in\nhigh volatility market environments; \u2022 Availability of lendable securities; \u2022 Sophistication of the trading\ncounterparty's trading capabilities and infrastructure/facilities; \u2022 The operational efficiency with which\ntransactions are processed and cleared, taking into account the order size and complexity; \u2022 Speed and\nresponsiveness to the Adviser; \u2022 Access to secondary markets; \u2022 Counterparty exposure; and \u2022 Depending upon\nthe circumstances, the Adviser may take other relevant factors into account if the Adviser believes that\nthese are important in taking all sufficient steps to obtain the best possible result for execution of the\norder. In selecting a trading counterparty, the price of the transaction and costs related to the execution\nof the transaction typically merit a high relative importance, depending on the circumstances. The Adviser\ndoes not necessarily select a trading counterparty based upon price and costs but may take other relevant\nfactors into account if it believes that these are important in taking reasonable steps to obtain the best\npossible result for a Fund under the circumstances.\n\n43\n\nConsequently, the Adviser may cause a client to pay a trading counterparty more than another trading\ncounterparty might have charged for the same transaction in recognition of the value and quality of the\nbrokerage services provided. The following matters may influence the relative importance that the Adviser\nplaces upon the relevant factors: (i) The nature and characteristics of the order or transaction. For\nexample, size of order, market impact of order, limits, or other instructions relating to the order; (ii)\nThe characteristics of the financial instrument(s) or other assets which are the subject of that order. For\nexample, whether the order pertains to an equity, fixed income, derivative or convertible instrument; (iii)\nThe characteristics of the execution venues to which that order can be directed, if relevant. For example,\navailability and capabilities of electronic trading systems; (iv) Whether the transaction is a \u2018delivery\nversus payment' or \u2018over-the-counter' transaction. The creditworthiness of the trading counterparty, the\namount of existing exposure to a trading counterparty and trading counterparty settlement capabilities may\nbe given a higher relative importance in the case of \u2018over-the-counter' transactions; and/or (v) Any other\ncircumstances that the Adviser believes are relevant at the time. The process by which trading\ncounterparties are selected to effect transactions is designed to exclude consideration of the sales efforts\nconducted by broker-dealers in relation to the Funds. The Adviser does not currently use the Funds' assets\nin connection with third-party soft dollar arrangements. While the Adviser does not currently use \u201c soft \u201d\nor commission dollars paid by the Funds for the purchase of third-party research, the Adviser reserves the\nright to do so in the future. The table below shows the aggregate dollar amount of brokerage commissions\npaid by SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF for the past three fiscal years ended December 31.\nNone of the brokerage commissions paid were paid to affiliated brokers and the SPDR Bloomberg International\nCorporate Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International\nTreasury Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International Government Inflation-Protected Bond ETF did not pay any\nbrokerage commissions. Brokerage commissions paid by a Fund may be substantially different from year to year\nfor multiple reasons, including market volatility, the demand for a particular Fund, or increases or\ndecreases in trading volume.\n                                                                      \n  Fund                                            2023  2022    2021  \n  SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF     \u2014     \u2014  $4,777  \n                                                                      \nSecurities of \u201c Regular Broker-Dealers \u201d : Each Fund is required to identify any securities of its \u201c regular\nbrokers and dealers \u201d (as such term is defined in the 1940 Act) which it may hold at the close of its most\nrecent fiscal year. \u201c Regular brokers or dealers \u201d of the Trust are the ten brokers or dealers that, during\nthe most recent fiscal year: (i) received the greatest dollar amounts of brokerage commissions from the\nTrust's portfolio transactions; (ii) engaged as principal in the largest dollar amounts of portfolio\ntransactions of the Trust; or (iii) sold the largest dollar amounts of the Trust's shares. As of December\n31, 2023, the Funds did not have any holdings in securities of Regular Broker-Dealers. Portfolio Turnover:\nPortfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as within a year. The Funds may experience higher\nportfolio turnover when migrating to a different benchmark index. High turnover rates are likely to result\nin comparatively greater brokerage expenses or transaction costs. The overall reasonableness of brokerage\ncommissions and transaction costs is evaluated by the Adviser based upon its knowledge of available\ninformation as to the general level of commissions and transaction costs paid by other institutional\ninvestors for comparable services. Book Entry Only System The following information supplements and should\nbe read in conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION. \u201d The Depository Trust Company ( \u201c DTC \u201d ) acts as securities depositary for the Shares. Shares\nof each Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., and\ndeposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. Except in the limited circumstance provided below, certificates will\nnot be issued for Shares.\n\n44\n\nDTC, a limited-purpose trust company, was created to hold securities of its participants (the \u201c DTC\nParticipants \u201d ) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among the DTC\nParticipants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the DTC Participants,\nthereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC Participants include\nsecurities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other\norganizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC. More specifically, DTC is owned by a\nnumber of its DTC Participants and by the New York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) and FINRA. Access to the DTC\nsystem is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or\nmaintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (the \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of Shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and\npersons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in Shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as \u201c Beneficial Owners \u201d )\nis shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect\nto DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and\nBeneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of Shares. Conveyance of all notices,\nstatements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the Depositary\nAgreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a\nfee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the Shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust,\neither directly or through a third party service, shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the\nnumber of Beneficial Owners holding Shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust,\neither directly or through a third party service, shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of\nsuch notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC\nParticipant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted\nby such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay\nto each such DTC Participant and/or third party service a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for\nthe expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.\nShare distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the registered holder of all Shares.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants'\naccounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in Shares of a Fund\nas shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and\nBeneficial Owners of Shares held through such DTC Participants will be governed by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or\nregistered in a \u201c street name, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspects of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or\npayments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such Shares, or for maintaining, supervising\nor reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the\nrelationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may determine to\ndiscontinue providing its service with respect to Shares at any time by giving reasonable notice to the\nTrust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action either to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at\na comparable cost or, if such a replacement is unavailable, to issue and deliver printed certificates\nrepresenting ownership of Shares, unless the Trust makes other arrangements with respect thereto\nsatisfactory to the Exchange. Control Persons and Principal Holders of Securities Although the Funds do not\nhave information concerning their beneficial ownership held in the names of DTC Participants, as of April 5,\n2024, the

When accepting\npurchases of Creation Units for cash, a Fund may incur additional costs associated with the acquisition of\nDeposit Securities that would otherwise be provided by an in-kind purchaser. Together, the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, and the Cash Component constitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d which\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of a Fund. The \u201c Cash\nComponent, \u201d which may include a Dividend Equivalent Payment, is an amount equal to the difference between\nthe net asset value of the Shares (per Creation Unit) and the market value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable. The \u201c Dividend Equivalent Payment \u201d enables a Fund to make a complete\ndistribution of dividends on the day preceding the next dividend payment date, and is an amount equal, on a\nper Creation Unit basis, to the dividends on all the portfolio securities of the Fund ( \u201c Dividend\nSecurities \u201d ) with ex-dividend dates within the accumulation period for such distribution (the \u201c\nAccumulation Period \u201d ), net of expenses and liabilities for such period, as if all of the Dividend\nSecurities had been held by the Fund for the entire Accumulation Period. The Accumulation Period begins on\nthe ex-dividend date for each Fund and ends on the day preceding the next ex-dividend date. If the Cash\nComponent is a positive number (i.e., the net asset value per Creation Unit exceeds the market value of the\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash Component shall be such positive amount. If the\nCash Component is a negative number (i.e., the net asset value per Creation Unit is less than the market\nvalue of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash Component shall be such negative\namount and the creator will be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the Cash Component. The Cash\nComponent serves the function of compensating for any differences between the net asset value per Creation\nUnit and the market value of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable. Computation of the Cash\nComponent excludes any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial\nownership of the Deposit Securities, if applicable, which shall be the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below).\n\n48\n\nThe Custodian, through NSCC, makes available on each Business Day, prior to the opening of business on the\nExchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern time), the list of the names and the required number of shares of\neach Deposit Security or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, to be included in the current\nstandard Fund Deposit (based on information at the end of the previous Business Day) for a Fund. Such\nstandard Fund Deposit is subject to any applicable adjustments as described below, in order to effect\npurchases of Creation Units of a Fund until such time as the next-announced composition of the Deposit\nSecurities or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, is made available. The identity and number\nof shares of the Deposit Securities or the amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, required for a Fund\nDeposit for each Fund may be changed from time to time with a view to the investment objective of the Fund.\nInformation regarding the Fund Deposit necessary for the purchase of a Creation Unit is made available to\nAuthorized Participants and other market participants seeking to transact in Creation Unit aggregations. The\nTrust intends to require the substitution of an amount of cash (i.e., a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount) to replace\nany Deposit Security that is a TBA transaction. The amount of cash contributed will be equivalent to the\nprice of the TBA transaction listed as a Deposit Security. As noted above, the Trust reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit Cash to replace any Deposit Security, which shall be added to\nthe Cash Component, including, without limitation, in situations where the Deposit Security: (i) may not be\navailable in sufficient quantity for delivery, (ii) may not be eligible for transfer through the systems of\nDTC for corporate securities and municipal securities or the Federal Reserve System for U.S. Treasury\nsecurities; (iii) may not be eligible for trading by an Authorized Participant (as defined below) or the\ninvestor for which it is acting; (iv) would be restricted under the securities laws or where the delivery of\nthe Deposit Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Deposit Security\nby the Authorized Participant becoming restricted under the securities laws, or (v) in certain other\nsituations (collectively, \u201c non-standard orders \u201d ). The Trust also reserves the right to: (i) permit or\nrequire the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of Deposit Cash; and (ii) include or remove Deposit\nSecurities from the basket in anticipation of portfolio changes. The adjustments described above will\nreflect changes, known to the Adviser on the date of announcement to be in effect by the time of delivery of\nthe Fund Deposit, in the composition of the subject Index being tracked by the relevant Fund or resulting\nfrom certain corporate actions. PROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION UNITS To be eligible to place orders\nwith the Principal Underwriter, as facilitated via the Transfer Agent, to purchase a Creation Unit of a\nFund, an entity must be (i) a \u201c Participating Party \u201d , i.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in the\nclearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the SEC; or (ii) a DTC Participant (see \u201c Book Entry Only System \u201d\n), and (except with respect to the SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF and SPDR Bloomberg Short\nTerm International Treasury Bond ETF) must have the ability to clear through the Federal Reserve System. In\naddition, each Participating Party or DTC Participant (each, an \u201c Authorized Participant \u201d ) must execute a\nParticipant Agreement that has been agreed to by the Principal Underwriter and the Transfer Agent, and that\nhas been accepted by the Trust, with respect to purchases and redemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized\nParticipant will agree, pursuant to the terms of a Participant Agreement, on behalf of itself or any\ninvestor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that it will pay to the Trust, an\namount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component together with the creation transaction fee (described\nbelow) and any other applicable fees, taxes and additional variable charge. All orders to purchase Shares\ndirectly from a Fund, including non-standard orders, must be placed for one or more Creation Units and in\nthe manner and by the time set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or the applicable order form. The date\non which an order to purchase Creation Units (or an order to redeem Creation Units, as set forth below) is\nreceived and accepted is referred to as the \u201c Order Placement Date. \u201d An Authorized Participant may require\nan investor to make certain representations or enter into agreements with respect to the order (e.g., to\nprovide for payments of cash, when required). Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not\nhave executed a Participant Agreement and that, therefore, orders to purchase Shares directly from a Fund in\nCreation Units have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant that has\nexecuted a Participant Agreement. In such cases there may be additional charges to such investor. At any\ngiven time, there may be only a limited number of broker-dealers that have executed a Participant Agreement\nand only a small number of such Authorized Participants may have international capabilities.\n\n49\n\nOn days when the Exchange or the bond markets close earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to create\nCreation Units to be placed earlier in the day. In addition, if a market or markets on which a Fund's\ninvestments are primarily traded is closed, the Fund will also generally not accept orders on such day(s).\nOrders must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant by telephone or other transmission method acceptable\nto the Distributor pursuant to procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement and in accordance with the\napplicable order form. Those placing orders through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time\nto permit proper submission of the purchase order by the cut-off time. Economic or market disruptions or\nchanges, or telephone or other communication failure may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or an\nAuthorized Participant. Fund Deposits must be delivered by an Authorized Participant through the Federal\nReserve System (for cash and U.S. government securities), or through DTC (for corporate securities and\nmunicipal securities), through a subcustody agent (for foreign securities) and/or through such other\narrangements allowed by the Trust or its agents. With respect to foreign Deposit Securities, the Custodian\nshall cause the subcustodian of a Fund to maintain an account into which the Authorized Participant shall\ndeliver, on behalf of itself or the party on whose behalf it is acting, such Deposit Securities. Foreign\nDeposit Securities must be delivered to an account maintained at the applicable local subcustodian. The Fund\nDeposit transfer must be ordered by the Authorized Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure the\ndelivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, to the account of a\nFund or its agents by no later than the Settlement Date. The \u201c Settlement Date \u201d for a Fund is generally the\nsecond Business Day ( \u201c T+2 \u201d ) after the Order Placement Date. The Settlement Date for the SPDR Bloomberg\nEmerging Markets Local Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International Government Inflation-Protected Bond ETF is the\nthird Business Day ( \u201c T+3 \u201d ) after the Order Placement Date. All questions as to the number of Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as applicable, and the validity, form and eligibility (including\ntime of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities or cash, as applicable, will be determined by\nthe Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash represented by the Cash\nComponent must be transferred directly to the Custodian through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer\nsystem in a timely manner so as to be received by the Custodian no later than the Settlement Date. If the\nCash Component and the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, are not received in a timely\nmanner by the Settlement Date, the creation order may be cancelled. Upon written notice to the Distributor,\nsuch canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a Fund Deposit as newly constituted\nto reflect the then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur\nno later than the second Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received by\nthe Distributor. Delivery of Creation Units will occur no later than the third Business Day following the\nday on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor for the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging\nMarkets Local Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International Government Inflation-Protected Bond ETF. The order shall\nbe deemed to be received on the Business Day on which the order is placed provided that the order is placed\nin proper form prior to the applicable cut-off time and the federal funds in the appropriate amount are\ndeposited by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions), with the Custodian on the\nSettlement Date. If the order is not placed in proper form as required, or federal funds in the appropriate\namount are not received by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions) on the\nSettlement Date, then the order may be deemed to be rejected and the Authorized Participant shall be liable\nto the Fund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom. A creation request is considered to be in \u201c proper form\n\u201d if all procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement, order form and this SAI are properly followed.\nISSUANCE OF A CREATION UNIT Except as provided herein, Creation Units will not be issued until the transfer\nof good title to the Trust of the Deposit Securities or payment of Deposit Cash, as applicable, and the\npayment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the subcustodian has confirmed to the Custodian that\nthe required Deposit Securities (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the\nrelevant subcustodian or subcustodians, the Principal Underwriter and the Adviser shall be notified of such\ndelivery, and the Trust will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Units. In instances where the\nTrust accepts Deposit Securities for the purchase of a Creation Unit, the Creation Unit may be purchased in\nadvance of receipt by the Trust of all or a portion of the applicable Deposit Securities as described below.\nIn these circumstances, the initial deposit will have a value greater than the net asset value of the Shares\non the date the order is placed in proper form since in addition to available Deposit Securities, cash must\nbe deposited in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Cash Component, plus (ii) an additional amount of cash\nequal to a percentage of the market value as set forth in the Participant Agreement, of the undelivered\nDeposit Securities (the \u201c Additional Cash Deposit \u201d ), which shall be maintained in a general non-interest\nbearing collateral account. An additional amount of cash shall be required to be\n\n50\n\ndeposited with the Trust, pending delivery of the missing Deposit Securities to the extent necessary to\nmaintain the Additional Cash Deposit with the Trust in an amount at least equal to the applicable\npercentage, as set forth in the Participant Agreement, of the daily marked to market value of the missing\nDeposit Securities. The Trust may use such Additional Cash Deposit to buy the missing Deposit Securities at\nany time. Authorized Participants will be liable to the Trust for all costs, expenses, dividends, income and\ntaxes associated with missing Deposit Securities, including the costs incurred by the Trust in connection\nwith any such purchases. These costs will be deemed to include the amount by which the actual purchase price\nof the Deposit Securities exceeds the market value of such Deposit Securities on the day the purchase order\nwas deemed received by the Principal Underwriter plus the brokerage and related transaction costs associated\nwith such purchases. The Trust will return any unused portion of the Additional Cash Deposit once all of the\nmissing Deposit Securities have been properly received by the Custodian or purchased by the Trust and\ndeposited into the Trust. In addition, a transaction fee as set forth below under \u201c Creation Transaction\nFees \u201d will be charged in all cases and an additional variable charge may also be applied. The delivery of\nCreation Units so created generally will occur no later than the Settlement Date. ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF\nCREATION UNITS The Trust reserves the right to reject an order for Creation Units transmitted in respect of\na Fund at its discretion, including, without limitation, if (a) the order is not in proper form or the\nDeposit Securities delivered do not consist of the securities that the Custodian specified; (b) the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, delivered by the Authorized Participant are not as disseminated\nthrough the facilities of the NSCC for that date by the Custodian; (c) the investor(s), upon obtaining the\nShares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding Shares of the Fund; (d) the acceptance of\nthe Fund Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (e) the acceptance or receipt of the order\nfor a Creation Unit would, in the opinion of counsel to the Trust, be unlawful; or (f) in the event that\ncircumstances outside the control of the Trust, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent, the Distributor and/or\nthe Adviser make it for all practical purposes not feasible to process orders for Creation Units. Examples\nof such circumstances include acts of God or public service or utility problems such as fires, floods,\nextreme weather conditions and power outages resulting in telephone, telecopy and computer failures; market\nconditions or activities causing trading halts; systems failures involving computer or other information\nsystems affecting the Trust, the Principal Underwriter, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent, DTC, NSCC,\nFederal Reserve System, or any other participant in the creation process, and other extraordinary events.\nThe Trust or its agents shall communicate to the Authorized Participant its rejection of an order. The\nTrust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian and the Principal Underwriter are under no duty, however, to give\nnotification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall either of them\nincur any liability for the failure to give any such notification. The Trust, the Transfer Agent, the\nCustodian and the Principal Underwriter shall not be liable for the rejection of any purchase order for\nCreation Units. Given the importance of the ongoing issuance of Creation Units to maintaining a market price\nthat is at or close to the underlying net asset value of a Fund, the Trust does not intend to suspend\nacceptance of orders for Creation Units. All questions as to the number of shares of each security in the\nDeposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of any securities to be\ndelivered shall be determined by the Trust, and the Trust's determination shall be final and binding.\nREDEMPTION Shares may be redeemed only in Creation Units at their net asset value next determined after\nreceipt of a redemption request in proper form by a Fund through the Transfer Agent and only on a Business\nDay. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF A FUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN AMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION\nUNITS. Investors must accumulate enough Shares in the secondary market to constitute a Creation Unit in\norder to have such Shares redeemed by the Trust. There can be no assurance, however, that there will be\nsufficient liquidity in the public trading market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit.\nInvestors should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number\nof Shares to constitute a redeemable Creation Unit. With respect to each Fund, the Custodian, through the\nNSCC, makes available prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m. Eastern time) on\neach Business Day, the list of the names and share quantities of securities designated by the Fund that will\nbe applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption requests received in proper form\n(as defined below) on that day ( \u201c Redemption Securities \u201d ). Redemption Securities received on redemption\nmay not be identical to Deposit Securities. The identity and number of shares of the Redemption Securities\nor the Cash Redemption Amount (defined below) may be changed from time to time with a view to the investment\nobjective of a Fund.\n\n51\n\nRedemption proceeds for a Creation Unit are paid either in-kind or in cash, or a combination thereof, as\ndetermined by the Trust. With respect to in-kind redemptions of a Fund, redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit will consist of Redemption Securities plus cash in an amount equal to the difference between the net\nasset value of the Fund Shares being redeemed, as next determined after a receipt of a request in proper\nform, and the value of the Redemption Securities (the \u201c Cash Redemption Amount \u201d ), less a fixed redemption\ntransaction fee and any applicable additional variable charge as set forth below. In the event that the\nRedemption Securities have a value greater than the net asset value of the Fund Shares, a compensating cash\npayment equal to the differential is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Trust's discretion, an Authorized Participant\nmay receive the corresponding cash value of the securities in lieu of the in-kind securities value\nrepresenting one or more Redemption Securities. PROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS After the Trust\nhas deemed an order for redemption received, the Trust will initiate procedures to transfer the requisite\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to the Authorized Participant by the Settlement Date.\nWith respect to in-kind redemptions of a Fund, the calculation of the value of the Redemption Securities and\nthe Cash Redemption Amount to be delivered upon redemption will be made by the Custodian according to the\nprocedures set forth under \u201c Determination of Net Asset Value \u201d , computed on the Business Day on which a\nredemption order is deemed received by the Trust. Therefore, if a redemption order in proper form is\nsubmitted to the Principal Underwriter by a DTC Participant by the specified time on the Order Placement\nDate, and the requisite number of Shares of a Fund are delivered to the Custodian prior to 2:00 p.m. or 3:00\np.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions) on the Settlement Date, then the value of the Redemption\nSecurities and the Cash Redemption Amount to be delivered will be determined by the Custodian on such Order\nPlacement Date. If the requisite number of Shares of the Fund are not delivered by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions) on the Settlement Date, the Fund will not release the underlying\nsecurities for delivery unless collateral is posted in such percentage amount of missing Shares as set forth\nin the Participant Agreement (marked to market daily). With respect to in-kind redemptions of a Fund, in\nconnection with taking delivery of shares of Redemption Securities upon redemption of Creation Units, an\nAuthorized Participant must maintain appropriate custody arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank\nor other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the Redemption Securities are customarily\ntraded (or such other arrangements as allowed by the Trust or its agents), to which account such Redemption\nSecurities will be delivered. Deliveries of redemption proceeds generally will be made within two Business\nDays, or in the case of the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International\nGovernment Inflation-Protected Bond ETF within three Business Days, of the trade date. Due to the schedule\nof holidays in certain countries, however, the delivery of in-kind redemption proceeds may take longer than\ntwo or three Business Days, as applicable, after the day on which the redemption request is received in\nproper form. If the Authorized Participant has not made appropriate arrangements to take delivery of the\nRedemption Securities in the applicable foreign jurisdiction and it is not possible to make other such\narrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of the Redemption Securities in such\njurisdiction, the Trust may, in its discretion, exercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash, and the\nAuthorized Participant will be required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. If it is not possible to\nmake other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of the Redemption Securities,\nthe Trust may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash, and the redeeming\ninvestor will be required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In addition, an investor may request a\nredemption in cash that a Fund may, in its sole discretion, permit. In either case, the investor will\nreceive a cash payment equal to the NAV of its Shares based on the NAV of Shares of the relevant Fund next\ndetermined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charge for requested cash redemptions specified above, to offset the Trust's brokerage and other\ntransaction costs associated with the disposition of Redemption Securities). A Fund may also, in its sole\ndiscretion, upon request of a shareholder, provide such redeemer a portfolio of securities that differs from\nthe exact composition of the Redemption Securities but does not differ in net asset value. An Authorized\nParticipant submitting a redemption request is deemed to represent to the Trust that, as of the close of the\nBusiness Day on which the redemption request was submitted, it (or its client) will own (within the meaning\nof Rule 200 of Regulation SHO) or has arranged to borrow for delivery to the Trust on or prior to the\nSettlement Date of the redemption request, the requisite number of Shares of the relevant Fund to be\nredeemed as a Creation Unit. In either case, the Authorized Participant is deemed to acknowledge that: (i)\nit (or its client) has full legal authority and legal right to tender for redemption the requisite number of\nShares of the applicable Fund and to receive the entire proceeds of the redemption;\n\n52\n\nand (ii) if such Shares submitted for redemption have been loaned or pledged to another party or are the\nsubject of a repurchase agreement, securities lending agreement or any other arrangement affecting legal or\nbeneficial ownership of such Shares being tendered, there are no restrictions precluding the tender and\ndelivery of such Shares (including borrowed shares, if any) for redemption, free and clear of liens, on the\nredemption Settlement Date. The Trust reserves the right to verify these representations at its discretion,\nbut will typically require verification with respect to a redemption request from a Fund in connection with\nhigher levels of redemption activity and/or short interest in the Fund. If the Authorized Participant, upon\nreceipt of a verification request, does not provide sufficient verification of its representations as\ndetermined by the Trust, the redemption request will not be considered to have been received in proper form\nand may be rejected by the Trust. Redemptions of Shares for Redemption Securities will be subject to\ncompliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it otherwise\npermits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Trust\ncould not lawfully deliver specific Redemption Securities upon redemptions or could not do so without first\nregistering the Redemption Securities under such laws. An Authorized Participant or an investor for which it\nis acting subject to a legal restriction with respect to a particular security included in the Redemption\nSecurities applicable to the redemption of Creation Units may be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The\nAuthorized Participant may request the redeeming investor of the Shares to complete an order form or to\nenter into agreements with respect to such matters as compensating cash payment. Further, an Authorized\nParticipant that is not a \u201c qualified institutional buyer, \u201d ( \u201c QIB \u201d ) as such term is defined under Rule\n144A of the Securities Act, will not be able to receive Redemption Securities that are restricted securities\neligible for resale under Rule 144A. An Authorized Participant may be required by the Trust to provide a\nwritten confirmation with respect to QIB status in order to receive Redemption Securities. The right of\nredemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to a Fund (1) for any period\nduring which the Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (2) for any period\nduring which trading on the Exchange is suspended or restricted; (3) for any period during which an\nemergency exists as a result of which disposal of the Shares of the Fund or determination of the NAV of the\nShares is not reasonably practicable; or (4) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC. REQUIRED\nEARLY ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS FOR CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL FUNDS Notwithstanding the foregoing, as described in\nthe Participant Agreement and/or the applicable order form, certain Funds may require orders to be placed\nprior to the trade date, as described in the Participant Agreement or the applicable order form, in order to\nreceive the trade date's net asset value. The cut-off time to receive the trade date's net asset value will\nnot precede the calculation of the net asset value of a Fund's shares on the prior Business Day. Orders to\npurchase Shares of such Funds that are submitted on the Business Day immediately preceding a holiday or a\nday (other than a weekend) that the equity markets in the relevant foreign market are closed may not be\naccepted. Authorized Participants may be notified that the cut-off time for an order may be earlier on a\nparticular Business Day, as described in the Participant Agreement and the applicable order form. CREATION\nAND REDEMPTION TRANSACTION FEES A transaction fee, as set forth in the table below, is imposed for the\ntransfer and other transaction costs associated with the purchase or redemption of Creation Units, as\napplicable. Authorized Participants will be required to pay a fixed creation transaction fee and/or a fixed\nredemption transaction fee, as applicable, on a given day regardless of the number of Creation Units created\nor redeemed on that day. A Fund may adjust the transaction fee from time to time. An additional charge or a\nvariable charge (discussed below) will be applied to certain creation and redemption transactions, including\nnon-standard orders and whole or partial cash purchases or redemptions. With respect to creation orders,\nAuthorized Participants are responsible for the costs of transferring the securities constituting the\nDeposit Securities to the account of the Trust and with respect to redemption orders, Authorized\nParticipants are responsible for the costs of transferring the Redemption Securities from the Trust to their\naccount or on their order. Investors who use the services of a broker or other such intermediary may also be\ncharged a fee for such services.

An additional\ncharge of up to three (3) times the standard transaction fee may be charged to the extent a transaction is\noutside of the clearing process. ** In addition to the transaction fees listed above, the Funds may charge\nan additional variable fee for creations and redemptions in cash to offset brokerage and impact expenses\nassociated with the cash transaction. The variable transaction fee will be calculated based on historical\ntransaction cost data and the Adviser's view of current market conditions; however, the actual variable fee\ncharged for a given transaction may be lower or higher than the trading expenses incurred by a Fund with\nrespect to that transaction. Determination of Net Asset Value The following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the sections in the Prospectus entitled \u201c PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION \u201d\nand \u201c ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d NAV per Share for each Fund is computed by dividing the\nvalue of the net assets of the Fund (i.e., the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the\ntotal number of Shares outstanding. Expenses and fees, including the management fees, are accrued daily and\ntaken into account for purposes of determining NAV. The NAV of each Fund is calculated by State Street and\ndetermined once daily as of the close of the regular trading session on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m.\nEastern time) on each day that such exchange is open. Creation/redemption order cut-off times may be earlier\non any day that the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (or applicable exchange or market\non which a Fund's investments are traded) announces an early closing time. Any assets or liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at market rates on the\ndate of valuation (generally as of 4:00 p.m. London time) as quoted by one or more sources. In calculating a\nFund's net asset value per Share, the Fund's investments are generally valued using market valuations. A\nmarket valuation generally means a valuation (i) obtained from an exchange, a pricing service, or a major\nmarket maker (or dealer) or (ii) based on a price quotation or other equivalent indication of value supplied\nby an exchange, a pricing service, or a major market maker (or dealer). Each Fund relies on a third-party\nservice provider for assistance with the daily calculation of the Fund's NAV. The third-party service\nprovider, in turn, relies on other parties for certain pricing data and other inputs used in the calculation\nof the Fund's NAV. Therefore, each Fund is subject to certain operational risks associated with reliance on\nits service provider and that service provider's sources of pricing and other data. NAV calculation may be\nadversely affected by operational risks arising from factors such as errors or failures in systems and\ntechnology. Such errors or failures may result in inaccurately calculated NAVs, delays in the calculation of\nNAVs and/or the inability to calculate NAV over extended time periods. A Fund may be unable to recover any\nlosses associated with such failures. In the case of shares of other funds that are not traded on an\nexchange, a market valuation means such fund's published net asset value per share. Each Fund may use\nvarious pricing services, or discontinue the use of any pricing service. Fixed-income assets are generally\nvalued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or\nexchange, and generally 4:00 p.m. EST for U.S. fixed-income assets. Fixed-income assets are generally valued\nat the mean of the bid and ask prices for bank loans and inflation protected securities, and at the bid\nprice for all other fixed-income assets. Pursuant to Board approved valuation procedures, the Board has\ndesignated the Adviser as the valuation designee for each Fund. These procedures address, among other\nthings, (i) determining (a) when market quotations are not readily available or reliable and (b) the\nmethodologies to be used for determining the fair value of investments, and (ii) the use and oversight of\nthird-party pricing services for fair valuation. The Adviser is responsible for periodically reviewing the\nprocedures, and the selected methodologies used, for their continuing appropriateness and accuracy, and\nmaking any changes or adjustments to the procedures and methodologies as appropriate. In the event that\ncurrent market valuations are not readily available or are deemed unreliable, the Trust's procedures require\nthe Adviser to determine a security's fair value. In determining a fair value, the Adviser may consider,\namong other things, (i) price comparisons among multiple sources, (ii) a review of corporate actions and\nnews events, and (iii) a review of relevant financial indicators (e.g., movement in interest rates, market\nindices, and prices from a Fund's Index provider). In these cases, a Fund's net asset value may reflect\ncertain portfolio securities' fair values rather than their market prices.\n\n54\n\nThe fair value of a portfolio instrument is generally the price which a Fund might reasonably expect to\nreceive upon its current sale in an orderly market between market participants. Ascertaining fair value\nrequires a determination of the amount that an arm's-length buyer, under the circumstances, would currently\npay for the portfolio instrument. Fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that\nthe fair value determination for a security is materially different than the value that could be realized\nupon the sale of the security. In addition, fair value pricing could result in a difference between the\nprices used to calculate a Fund's net asset value and the prices used by the Index. This may result in a\ndifference between a Fund's performance and the performance of the Index. Dividends and Distributions The\nfollowing information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the section in each Prospectus\nentitled \u201c DISTRIBUTIONS. \u201d GENERAL POLICIES Dividends from net investment income, if any, are generally\ndeclared and paid monthly by each Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally\nare declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more frequent basis for a Fund\nto improve index tracking or to comply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, in\nall events in a manner consistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act. Dividends and other distributions on\nShares are distributed, as described below, on a pro rata basis to Beneficial Owners of such Shares.\nDividend payments are made through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners then of\nrecord with proceeds received from the Trust. Management of the Trust reserves the right to declare special\ndividends if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve a Fund's\neligibility for treatment as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code or to avoid imposition of income or\nexcise taxes at the Fund level. DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT Broker dealers, at their own discretion, may offer a\ndividend reinvestment service under which Shares are purchased in the secondary market at current market\nprices. Investors should consult their broker dealer for further information regarding any dividend\nreinvestment service offered by such broker dealer. Taxes The following is a summary of certain federal\nincome tax considerations generally affecting the Funds and their shareholders that supplements the\ndiscussions in the Prospectus. No attempt is made to present a comprehensive explanation of the federal,\nstate, local or foreign tax treatment of the Funds or their shareholders, and the discussion here and in\neach Prospectus is not intended to be a substitute for careful tax planning. The following general\ndiscussion of certain federal income tax consequences is based on the Internal Revenue Code and the\nregulations issued thereunder as in effect on the date of this SAI. New legislation, as well as\nadministrative changes or court decisions, may significantly change the conclusions expressed herein, and\nmay have a retroactive effect with respect to the transactions contemplated herein. The following\ninformation should be read in conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c ADDITIONAL TAX\nINFORMATION. \u201d TAXATION OF THE FUNDS Each Fund is treated as a separate corporation for federal income tax\npurposes. A Fund therefore is considered to be a separate entity in determining its treatment under the\nrules for RICs described herein and in the Prospectus. Losses in one series of the Trust do not offset gains\nin any other series of the Trust and the requirements (other than certain organizational requirements) for\nqualifying for treatment as a RIC are determined at the Fund level rather than at the Trust level. Each Fund\nhas elected or will elect and intends to qualify each year to be treated as a separate RIC under Subchapter\nM of the Internal Revenue Code. As such, each Fund should not be subject to federal income tax on its net\ninvestment income and capital gains, if any, to the extent that it timely distributes such income and\ncapital gains to its shareholders. In order to qualify for treatment as a RIC, a Fund must distribute\nannually to its shareholders at least the\n\n55\n\nsum of 90% of its taxable net investment income (generally including the excess of net short-term capital\ngains over net long-term capital losses) and 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income, if any (the \u201c\nDistribution Requirement \u201d ) and also must meet several additional requirements. Among these requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of a Fund's gross income each taxable year must be derived from\ndividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other\ndisposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income derived with respect to its business\nof investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified\npublicly traded partnerships (the \u201c Qualifying Income Requirement \u201d ); and (ii) at the end of each quarter\nof a Fund's taxable year, its assets must be diversified so that (a) at least 50% of the market value of its\ntotal assets must be represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other securities limited, in respect to any one issuer, to an amount\nnot greater in value than 5% of the value of the Fund's total assets and to not more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is\ninvested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of any one\nissuer, the securities (other than securities of other RICs) of two or more issuers that it controls and\nthat are engaged in the same, similar, or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more\nqualified publicly traded partnerships (the \u201c Diversification Requirement \u201d ). If a Fund fails to satisfy\nthe Qualifying Income Requirement or the Diversification Requirement in any taxable year, the Fund may be\neligible for relief provisions if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if a\npenalty tax is paid with respect to each failure to satisfy the applicable requirements. Additionally,\nrelief is provided for certain de minimis failures of the Diversification Requirement where the Fund\ncorrects the failure within a specified period of time. In order to be eligible for the relief provisions\nwith respect to a failure to meet the Diversification Requirement, a Fund may be required to dispose of\ncertain assets. If these relief provisions were not available to a Fund and it were to fail to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all of its taxable income would be subject to tax at the applicable\ncorporate rate without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and its distributions (including\ncapital gains distributions) generally would be taxable as ordinary income dividends to its shareholders,\nsubject to the dividends-received deduction for corporate shareholders and the lower tax rates on qualified\ndividend income received by noncorporate shareholders. To requalify for treatment as a RIC in a subsequent\ntaxable year, the Fund would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and to\ndistribute any earnings and profits from any year in which the Fund failed to qualify for tax treatment as a\nRIC. If a Fund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, it would generally be\nrequired to pay a Fund-level tax on certain net built-in gains recognized with respect to certain of its\nassets upon a disposition of such assets within five years of qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year. The\nBoard reserves the right not to maintain the qualification of a Fund for treatment as a RIC if it determines\nsuch course of action to be beneficial to shareholders. As discussed more fully below, each Fund intends to\ndistribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital gains for each taxable year. If a\nFund meets the Distribution Requirement but retains some or all of its income or gains, it will be subject\nto federal income tax to the extent any such income or gains are not distributed. A Fund may designate\ncertain amounts retained as undistributed net capital gain in a notice to its shareholders, who (i) will be\nrequired to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed amount so designated, (ii) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the income tax paid by the Fund on that undistributed amount against their federal\nincome tax liabilities and to claim refunds to the extent such credits exceed their liabilities and (iii)\nwill be entitled to increase their tax basis, for federal income tax purposes, in their Shares by an amount\nequal to the excess of the amount of undistributed net capital gain included in their respective income over\ntheir respective income tax credits. If a Fund failed to satisfy the Distribution Requirement for any\ntaxable year, it would be taxed as a regular corporation, with consequences generally similar to those\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph. Given the concentration of certain of the Indexes in a relatively\nsmall number of securities, it may not be possible for certain Funds to fully implement sampling\nmethodologies while satisfying the Diversification Requirement. A Fund's efforts to satisfy the\nDiversification Requirement may affect the Fund's execution of its investment strategy and may cause the\nFund's return to deviate from that of the applicable Index, and the Fund's efforts to track the applicable\nIndex may cause it inadvertently to fail to satisfy the Diversification Requirement.\n\n56\n\nA Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its\nshareholders in each calendar year an amount at least equal to 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar\nyear plus 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the twelve months ended October 31 of such year, subject\nto an increase for any shortfall in the prior year's distribution. Each Fund intends to declare and\ndistribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of\nthis 4% excise tax. A Fund may elect to treat part or all of any \u201c qualified late year loss \u201d as if it had\nbeen incurred in the succeeding taxable year in determining the Fund's taxable income, net capital gain, net\nshort-term capital gain, and earnings and profits. The effect of this election is to treat any such \u201c\nqualified late year loss \u201d as if it had been incurred in the succeeding taxable year in characterizing Fund\ndistributions for any calendar year. A \u201c qualified late year loss \u201d generally includes net capital loss, net\nlong-term capital loss, or net short-term capital loss incurred after October 31 of the current taxable year\n(commonly referred to as \u201c post-October losses \u201d ) and certain other late-year losses. Capital losses in\nexcess of capital gains ( \u201c net capital losses \u201d ) are not permitted to be deducted against a RIC's net\ninvestment income. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, potentially subject to certain\nlimitations, a Fund may carry a net capital loss from any taxable year forward indefinitely to offset its\ncapital gains, if any, in years following the year of the loss. To the extent subsequent capital gains are\noffset by such losses, they will not result in U.S. federal income tax liability to the Fund and may not be\ndistributed as capital gains to its shareholders. Generally, the Funds may not carry forward any losses\nother than net capital losses. TAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014DISTRIBUTIONS Each Fund intends to distribute\nannually to its shareholders substantially all of its investment company taxable income (computed without\nregard to the deduction for dividends paid), its net tax-exempt income, if any, and any net capital gain\n(net recognized long-term capital gains in excess of net recognized short-term capital losses, taking into\naccount any capital loss carryforwards). Each Fund will report to shareholders annually the amounts of\ndividends paid from ordinary income and the amount of distributions of net capital gain. Since the Funds\nprimarily hold investments that do not pay dividends, it is not expected that a substantial portion (if any)\nof the dividends paid by a Fund will qualify for either the dividends-received deduction for corporations or\nthe favorable income tax rates available to individuals on qualified dividend income. Distributions from a\nFund's net short-term capital gains will generally be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income.\nDistributions from a Fund's net capital gain will be taxable to shareholders at long-term capital gains\nrates, regardless of how long shareholders have held their Shares. Long-term capital gains are generally\ntaxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Although dividends generally will be treated as\ndistributed when paid, any dividend declared by a Fund in October, November or December and payable to\nshareholders of record in such a month that is paid during the following January will be treated for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes as received by shareholders on December 31 of the calendar year in which it was\ndeclared. If a Fund's distributions exceed its earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions\nmade in the taxable year may be treated as a return of capital to shareholders. A return of capital\ndistribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's cost basis and result in a\nhigher capital gain or lower capital loss when the Shares on which the distribution was received are sold.\nAfter a shareholder's basis in the Shares has been reduced to zero, distributions in excess of earnings and\nprofits will be treated as gain from the sale of the shareholder's Shares. Under Section 163(j) of the Code,\na taxpayer's business interest expense is generally deductible to the extent of its business interest income\nplus certain other amounts. If a Fund earns business interest income, it may report a portion of its\ndividends as \u201c Section 163(j) interest dividends, \u201d which its shareholders may be able to treat as business\ninterest income for purposes of Section 163(j) of the Code. The Fund's \u201c Section 163(j) interest dividend \u201d\nfor a tax year will be limited to the excess of its business interest income over the sum of its business\ninterest expense and other deductions properly allocable to its business interest income. In general, a\nFund's shareholders may treat a distribution reported as a Section 163(j) interest dividend as interest\nincome only to the extent the distribution exceeds the sum of the portions of the distribution reported as\nother types of tax-favored income. To be eligible to treat a Section 163(j) interest dividend as interest\nincome, a shareholder may need to meet certain holding period requirements in respect of Fund Shares and\nmust not have hedged its position in Fund Shares in certain ways. Distributions that are reinvested in\nadditional Shares of a Fund through the means of a dividend reinvestment service, if offered by your broker-\ndealer, will nevertheless be taxable dividends to the same extent as if such dividends had been received in\ncash.\n\n57\n\nA 3.8% Medicare contribution tax generally applies to all or a portion of the net investment income of a\nshareholder who is an individual and not a nonresident alien for federal income tax purposes and who has\nadjusted gross income (subject to certain adjustments) that exceeds a threshold amount ($250,000 if married\nfiling jointly or if considered a \u201c surviving spouse \u201d for federal income tax purposes, $125,000 if married\nfiling separately, and $200,000 in other cases). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of the\nundistributed net investment income of certain shareholders that are estates and trusts. For these purposes,\ninterest, dividends and certain capital gains (generally including capital gain distributions and capital\ngains realized on the sale of Shares) are generally taken into account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. Distributions of ordinary income and capital gains may also be subject to foreign, state\nand local taxes depending on a shareholder's circumstances. TAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014SALE OF SHARES In\ngeneral, a sale of Shares results in capital gain or loss, and for individual shareholders, is taxable at a\nfederal rate dependent upon the length of time the Shares were held. A sale of Shares held for a period of\none year or less at the time of such sale will, for tax purposes, generally result in short-term capital\ngains or losses, and a sale of those held for more than one year will generally result in long-term capital\ngains or losses. Long-term capital gains are generally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates.\nGain or loss on the sale of Shares is measured by the difference between the amount received and the\nadjusted tax basis of the Shares. Shareholders should keep records of investments made (including Shares\nacquired through reinvestment of dividends and distributions) so they can compute the tax basis of their\nShares. A loss realized on a sale of Shares may be disallowed if substantially identical Shares are acquired\n(whether through the reinvestment of dividends or otherwise) within a sixty-one (61) day period beginning\nthirty (30) days before and ending thirty (30) days after the date that the Shares are disposed of. In such\na case, the basis of the Shares acquired must be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss upon the\nsale of Shares held for six (6) months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany amounts treated as distributions to the shareholder of long-term capital gain (including any amounts\ncredited to the shareholder as undistributed capital gains). COST BASIS REPORTING The cost basis of Shares\nacquired by purchase will generally be based on the amount paid for the Shares and then may be subsequently\nadjusted for other applicable transactions as required by the Internal Revenue Code. The difference between\nthe selling price and the cost basis of Shares generally determines the amount of the capital gain or loss\nrealized on the sale or exchange of Shares. Contact the broker through whom you purchased your Shares to\nobtain information with respect to the available cost basis reporting methods and elections for your\naccount. TAXATION OF FUND INVESTMENTS Dividends and interest received by a Fund on foreign securities may\ngive rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by foreign countries. Tax conventions between certain\ncountries and the United States may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If a Fund meets certain requirements,\nwhich include a requirement that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's total assets at the close of its\nrespective taxable year consist of certain foreign securities (generally including foreign government\nsecurities), then the Fund should be eligible to file an election with the IRS that may enable its\nshareholders, in effect, to receive either the benefit of a foreign tax credit, or a tax deduction, with\nrespect to certain foreign and U.S. possessions income taxes paid by the Fund, subject to certain\nlimitations. Pursuant to this election, a Fund would treat the applicable foreign taxes as dividends paid to\nits shareholders. Each such shareholder would be required to include a proportionate share of those taxes in\ngross income as income received from a foreign source and must treat the amount so included as if the\nshareholder had paid the foreign tax directly. The shareholder may then either deduct the taxes deemed paid\nby him or her in computing his or her taxable income or, alternatively, use the foregoing information in\ncalculating any foreign tax credit the shareholder may be entitled to use against such shareholder's federal\nincome tax. If a Fund makes this election, the Fund will report annually to its shareholders the respective\namounts per share of the Fund's income from sources within, and taxes paid to, foreign countries and U.S.\npossessions. No deduction for such taxes will be permitted to individuals in computing their alternative\nminimum tax liability. If a Fund does not make this election, the Fund will be entitled to claim a deduction\nfor certain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund. In certain instances, the Fund might not elect to apply\notherwise allowable U.S. federal income tax deductions for those foreign taxes, whether or not credits or\ndeductions for those foreign taxes could be passed through to its shareholders pursuant to the election\n\n58\n\ndescribed above. If the Fund does not elect to apply these deductions, taxable distributions you receive\nfrom the Fund may be larger than they would have been if the Fund had taken deductions for such taxes. Under\ncertain circumstances, if a Fund receives a refund of foreign taxes paid in respect of a prior year, the\nvalue of Shares could be affected or any foreign tax credits or deductions passed through to shareholders in\nrespect of the Fund's foreign taxes for the current year could be reduced. Certain of the Funds' investments\nmay be subject to complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to hedging\ntransactions, straddles, integrated transactions, foreign currency contracts, forward foreign currency\ncontracts, and notional principal contracts) that, among other things, may affect the character of gains and\nlosses realized by a Fund (e.g., may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of income to the Fund and defer losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount\nand timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also may require a Fund to mark-to-market\ncertain types of positions in its portfolio (i.e., treat them as if they were closed out) which may cause\nthe Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to make distributions to its shareholders in\namounts necessary to satisfy the RIC distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. The\nFunds intend to monitor their transactions, intend to make appropriate tax elections, and intend to make\nappropriate entries in their books and records in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and preserve\nthe Funds' qualification for treatment as RICs. Each Fund is required for federal income tax purposes to\nmark-to-market and recognize as income for each taxable year its net unrealized gains and losses on certain\nfutures contracts as of the end of the year as well as those actually realized during the year. Gain or loss\nfrom futures and options contracts on broad-based indexes required to be marked to market will be 60% long-\nterm and 40% short-term capital gain or loss. Application of this rule may alter the timing and character of\ndistributions to shareholders. A Fund may be required to defer the recognition of losses on futures\ncontracts, options contracts and swaps to the extent of any unrecognized gains on offsetting positions held\nby the Fund. It is anticipated that certain net gain realized from the closing out of futures or options\ncontracts will be considered gain from the sale of securities and therefore will be qualifying income for\npurposes of the Qualifying Income Requirement. Investments by a Fund in zero coupon or other discount\nsecurities will result in income to the Fund equal to a portion of the excess face value of the securities\nover their issue price (the \u201c original issue discount \u201d or \u201c OID \u201d ) each year that the securities are held,\neven though the Fund may receive no cash interest payments or may receive cash interest payments that are\nless than the income recognized for tax purposes. In other circumstances, whether pursuant to the terms of a\nsecurity or as a result of other factors outside the control of the Fund, a Fund may recognize income\nwithout receiving a commensurate amount of cash. Such income is included in determining the amount of income\nthat a Fund must distribute to maintain its eligibility for treatment as a RIC and to avoid the payment of\nfederal income tax, including the nondeductible 4% excise tax described above. Any market discount\nrecognized on a market discount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a bond\nacquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value, or below adjusted issue price if issued\nwith original issue discount. Absent an election by a Fund to include the market discount in income as it\naccrues, gain on the Fund's disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount. Where the income required to be recognized as a\nresult of the OID and/or market discount rules is not matched by a corresponding cash receipt by a Fund, the\nFund may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to enable the Fund to make distributions to\nits shareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a RIC and eliminate taxes at the Fund level. Special\nrules apply if a Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).\nGenerally, all stated interest on inflation-indexed bonds is taken into income by a Fund under its regular\nmethod of accounting for interest income. The amount of any positive inflation adjustment for a taxable\nyear, which results from an increase in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is treated as\nOID. The amount of a Fund's OID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will increase a Fund's taxable\nincome for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until the bond matures. As a result, the Fund\nmay need to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distribution requirements for the applicable year. The\namount of any negative inflation adjustments, which result from a decrease in the inflation-adjusted\nprincipal amount of the bond, first reduces the amount of interest (including stated interest, OID, and\nmarket discount, if any) otherwise includable in the Fund's taxable income with respect to the bond for the\ntaxable year; any remaining negative adjustments will be either treated as ordinary loss or, in certain\ncircumstances, carried forward to reduce the amount of interest income taken into account with respect to\nthe bond in future taxable years.\n\n59\n\nTAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS Certain tax-exempt shareholders, including qualified pension plans, individual\nretirement accounts, salary deferral arrangements, 401(k) plans, and other tax-exempt entities, generally\nare exempt from federal income taxation except with respect to their unrelated business taxable income ( \u201c\nUBTI \u201d ). Under current law, a Fund generally serves to block UBTI from being realized by its tax-exempt\nshareholders. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, tax-exempt shareholders could realize UBTI by virtue\nof their investment in a Fund where, for example, (i) the Fund invests in REITs that hold residual interests\nin real estate mortgage investment conduits ( \u201c REMICs \u201d ) or (ii) Shares constitute debt-financed property\nin the hands of the tax-exempt shareholders within the meaning of section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue\nCode. Charitable remainder trusts are subject to special rules and should consult their tax advisors. The\nIRS has issued guidance with respect to these issues and prospective shareholders, especially charitable\nremainder trusts, are strongly encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding these issues. Certain\ntax-exempt educational institutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on net investment income. For these\npurposes, certain dividends and capital gain distributions, and certain gains from the disposition of Shares\n(among other categories of income), are generally taken into account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. FOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS Dividends, other than capital gains dividends, \u201c short-term capital\ngain dividends \u201d and \u201c interest-related dividends \u201d (described below), paid by a Fund to shareholders who\nare nonresident aliens or foreign entities will be subject to a 30% United States withholding tax unless a\nreduced rate of withholding or a withholding exemption is provided under applicable treaty law to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term capital gain or unless such income is effectively connected\nwith a U.S. trade or business carried on through a permanent establishment in the United States. Nonresident\nshareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the applicability of the United States\nwithholding tax and the proper withholding form(s) to be submitted to a Fund. A non-U.S. shareholder who\nfails to provide an appropriate IRS Form W-8 may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.\nDividends reported by a Fund as (i) interest-related dividends, to the extent such dividends are derived\nfrom the Fund's \u201c qualified net interest income, \u201d or (ii) short-term capital gain dividends, to the extent\nsuch dividends are derived from the Fund's \u201c qualified short-term gain, \u201d are generally exempt from this 30%\nwithholding tax. \u201c Qualified net interest income \u201d is a Fund's net income derived from U.S.-source interest\nand original issue discount, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. \u201c Qualified short-term gain \u201d\ngenerally means the excess of a Fund's net short-term capital gain for the taxable year over its net long-\nterm capital loss, if any. In the case of Shares held through an intermediary, the intermediary may withhold\neven if a Fund reports the payment as an interest-related dividend or as a short-term capital gain dividend.\nNon-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these rules to\ntheir accounts. Unless certain non-U.S. entities that hold Shares comply with IRS requirements that will\ngenerally require them to report information regarding U.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts with,\nsuch entities, a 30% withholding tax may apply to Fund distributions payable to such entities. A non-U.S.\nshareholder may be exempt from the withholding described in this paragraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and a foreign government, provided that the shareholder and the\napplicable foreign government comply with the terms of such agreement. BACKUP WITHHOLDING A Fund will be\nrequired in certain cases to withhold (as \u201c backup withholding \u201d ) on amounts payable to any shareholder who\n(1) has provided the Fund either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all, (2) is subject\nto backup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends, (3) has\nfailed to certify to the Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding, or (4) has not\ncertified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will not be applied to payments that have been subject to the 30%\nwithholding tax on shareholders who are neither citizens nor permanent residents of the U.S. CREATION UNITS\nAn Authorized Participant who exchanges securities for Creation Units generally will recognize a gain or a\nloss. The gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the market value of the Creation Units at the\ntime and the sum of the exchanger's aggregate basis in the securities surrendered plus the amount of cash\npaid for such Creation Units. A person who redeems Creation Units will generally recognize a gain or loss\nequal to the difference between the exchanger's basis\n\n60\n\nin the Creation Units and the sum of the aggregate market value of any securities received plus the amount\nof any cash received for such Creation Units. The IRS, however, may assert that a loss realized upon an\nexchange of securities for Creation Units cannot be deducted currently under the rules governing \u201c wash\nsales, \u201d or on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic position. Any gain or loss\nrealized upon a creation of Creation Units will be treated as capital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the securities exchanged therefor as capital assets, and otherwise will be ordinary income\nor loss. Similarly, any gain or loss realized upon a redemption of Creation Units will be treated as capital\ngain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Shares comprising the Creation Units as capital assets,\nand otherwise will be ordinary income or loss. Any capital gain or loss realized upon the creation of\nCreation Units will generally be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the securities exchanged for\nsuch Creation Units have been held for more than one year, and otherwise will be short-term capital gain or\nloss. Any capital gain or loss realized upon the redemption of Creation Units will generally be treated as\nlong-term capital gain or loss if the Shares comprising the Creation Units have been held for more than one\nyear, and otherwise, will generally be short-term capital gain or loss. Any capital loss realized upon a\nredemption of Creation Units held for six (6) months or less will be treated as a long-term capital loss to\nthe extent of any amounts treated as distributions to the applicable Authorized Participant of long-term\ncapital gains with respect to the Creation Units (including any amounts credited to the Authorized\nParticipant as undistributed capital gains). A Fund has the right to reject an order for Creation Units if\nthe purchaser (or a group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund and if, pursuant to section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund would\nhave a basis in any deposit securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. A Fund also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial Share ownership\nfor purposes of the 80% determination. If a Fund does issue Creation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of\nthe Fund, the purchaser (or a group of purchasers) may not recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units. If a Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear additional costs and\nrecognize more capital gains than it would if it redeems Creation Units in kind. Persons purchasing or\nredeeming Creation Units should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax treatment of any\ncreation or redemption transaction. CERTAIN POTENTIAL TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Under promulgated Treasury\nregulations, if a shareholder recognizes a loss on disposition of a Fund's shares of $2 million or more for\nan individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder (or certain greater amounts\nover a combination of years), the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form\n8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not excepted. A shareholder who fails to\nmake the required disclosure to the IRS may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including significant\npenalties. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal\ndetermination of whether the taxpayer's treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their\ntax advisers to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.\nThe foregoing discussion is a summary only and is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning.\nPurchasers of Shares should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of investing in such\nShares, including under state, local and other tax laws. Finally, the foregoing discussion is based on\napplicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, judicial authority and administrative\ninterpretations in effect on the date hereof. Changes in applicable authority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes often occur. STATE TAX MATTERS The discussion of state and\nlocal tax treatment is based on the assumptions that the Funds will qualify for treatment under Subchapter M\nof the Internal Revenue Code as RICs and that each Fund will distribute all interest and dividends it\nreceives to its shareholders. The tax discussion summarizes general state and local tax laws which are\ncurrently in effect and which are subject to change by legislative, judicial or administrative action; any\nsuch changes may be retroactive with respect to the applicable Fund's transactions. Investors should consult\na tax advisor for more detailed information about state and local taxes to which they may be subject.\n\n61\n\nMany states grant tax-free status to dividends paid to you from interest earned on direct obligations of the\nU.S. government, subject in some states to minimum investment requirements that must be met by the Fund.\nInvestment in Government National Mortgage Association ( \u201c Ginnie Mae \u201d ) or Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d ) securities, banker's acceptances, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities do not generally qualify for such tax-free treatment. The rules\non exclusion of this income are different for corporate shareholders. Capital Stock and Other Securities\nEach Fund issues Shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per Share. The Board may designate additional\nfunds. Each Share issued by the Trust has a pro rata interest in the assets of the corresponding series of\nthe Trust. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights and are freely\ntransferable. Each Share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and distributions declared by the\nBoard with respect to each Fund, and in the net distributable assets of each Fund on liquidation. Each Share\nhas one vote with respect to matters upon which a shareholder vote is required consistent with the\nrequirements of the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Shares of all series of the Trust ( \u201c\nFunds \u201d ) vote together as a single class except that if the matter being voted on affects only a particular\nfund it will be voted on only by that fund and if a matter affects a particular fund differently from other\nFunds, that fund will vote separately on such matter. Under Massachusetts law, the Trust is not required to\nhold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust\nis not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. All Shares of\nthe Trust (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative voting rights for the election of Trustees. Under\nMassachusetts law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders. Under Massachusetts\nlaw, shareholders of a business trust may, under certain circumstances, be held personally liable as\npartners for obligations of the Trust. However, the Declaration of Trust contains an express disclaimer of\nshareholder liability for acts or obligations of the Trust, requires that Trust obligations include such\ndisclaimer, and provides for indemnification and reimbursement of expenses out of the Trust's property for\nany shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the Trust. Thus, the risk of a shareholder\nincurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which the Trust\nitself would be unable to meet its obligations. Given the above limitations on shareholder personal\nliability, and the nature of each Fund's assets and operations, the risk to shareholders of personal\nliability is believed to be remote. Shareholder inquiries may be made by writing to the Trust, c/o the\nDistributor, State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC at One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts\n02210. Counsel and Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, located at\n1111 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004, serves as counsel to the Trust. Ernst & Young LLP,\nlocated at 200 Clarendon Street, Boston, MA 02116, serves as the independent registered public accounting\nfirm of the Trust. Ernst & Young LLP performs annual audits of the Funds' financial statements and provides\nother audit, tax and related services. Local Market Holiday Schedules The Trust generally intends to effect\ndeliveries of portfolio securities on a basis of \u201c T \u201d plus two Business Days (i.e., days on which the NYSE\nis open), or in the case of the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International\nGovernment Inflation-Protected Bond ETF on a basis of \u201c T \u201d plus three Business Days, in the relevant\nforeign market of a Fund. The ability of the Trust to effect in-kind redemptions within two or three\nBusiness Days , as applicable, of receipt of a redemption request is subject, among other things, to the\ncondition that, within the time period from the date of the request to the date of delivery of the\nsecurities, there are no days that are local market holidays on the relevant Business Days. For every\noccurrence of one or more intervening holidays in the local market that are not holidays observed in the\nUnited States, the redemption settlement cycle may be extended by the number of such intervening local\nholidays. In addition to holidays, other unforeseeable closings in a foreign market due to emergencies may\nalso prevent the Trust from delivering securities within two or three Business Days, as applicable.\n\n62\n\nThe securities delivery cycles currently practicable for transferring portfolio securities to redeeming\ninvestors, coupled with local market holiday schedules, may require a delivery process longer than the\nstandard settlement period. In certain circumstances during the calendar year, the settlement period may be\ngreater than seven calendar days.

Theobligor's capacity to meet its financial commitments on the       \n                         obligation is very strong.                                                         \n                         An obligation rated \u2018A' is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of     \n  A                      changes incircumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated   \n                         categories. However,the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitments on    \n                         the obligation is still strong.                                                    \n                         An obligation rated \u2018BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However,        \n  BBB                    adverse economicconditions or changing circumstances are more likely to weaken     \n                         the obligor's capacity to meetits financial commitments on the obligation.         \n                         Obligations rated \u2018BB', \u2018B', \u2018CCC', \u2018CC', and \u2018C' are regarded as having           \n                         significant speculativecharacteristics. \u2018BB' indicates the least degree of         \n  BB, B, CCC, CC, and C  speculation and \u2018C' the highest. While suchobligations will likely have some       \n                         quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighedby large            \n                         uncertainties or major exposure to adverse conditions.                             \n                         An obligation rated \u2018BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative   \n  BB                     issues.However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse        \n                         business, financial, oreconomic conditions that could lead to the obligor's        \n                         inadequate capacity to meet its financialcommitments on the obligation.            \n                         An obligation rated \u2018B' is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated    \n                         \u2018BB', but theobligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments  \n  B                      on the obligation.

In the event of adverse           \n                         business, financial, or economicconditions, the obligor is not likely to have the  \n                         capacity to meet its financial commitments on theobligation.                       \n                         An obligation rated \u2018CC' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The \u2018CC'    \n  CC                     rating is usedwhen a default has not yet occurred but S&P Global Ratings expects   \n                         default to be a virtualcertainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default.   \n                         An obligation rated \u2018C' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the      \n  C                      obligation isexpected to have lower relative seniority or lower ultimate recovery  \n                         compared with obligationsthat are rated higher.                                    \n                         An obligation rated \u2018D' is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For      \n                         non-hybrid capitalinstruments, the \u2018D' rating category is used when payments on    \n                         an obligation are not made onthe date due, unless S&P Global Ratings believes      \n                         that such payments will be made within fivebusiness days in the absence of a       \n  D                      stated grace period or within the earlier of the stated graceperiod or 30          \n                         calendar days.

Fitch Ratings\nLtd.'s ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ) Corporate Finance Obligations \u2013 Long-Term Ratings: AAA: Highest Credit Quality. \u2018AAA'\nratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally\nstrong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely\naffected by foreseeable events. AA: Very High Credit Quality. \u2018AA' ratings denote expectations of very low\ncredit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not\nsignificantly vulnerable to foreseeable events. A: High Credit Quality. \u2018A' ratings denote expectations of\nlow credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may,\nnevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher\nratings. BBB: Good Credit Quality. \u2018BBB' ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently\nlow. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate, but adverse business or\neconomic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity. BB: Speculative. \u2018BB' ratings indicate an\nelevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic\nconditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial\ncommitments to be met. B: Highly Speculative. \u2018B' ratings indicate that material credit risk is present.\nCCC: Substantial Credit Risk. \u2018CCC' ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present. CC: Very High\nLevels of Credit Risk. \u2018CC' ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk. C: Exceptionally High Levels\nof Credit Risk. \u2018C' indicates exceptionally high levels of credit risk.\n\nA-2\n\nAppendix B SPDR \u00ae Series Trust\nSPDR \u00ae Index Shares Funds\nSSGA Active Trust\n(each, a \u201c Trust \u201d or \u201c Fund, \u201d and, collectively, the \u201c Trusts \u201d or \u201c Funds \u201d ) PROXY VOTING POLICY AND\nPROCEDURES The Board of Trustees of the Trusts has adopted the following policy and procedures with respect\nto voting proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Trusts' investment portfolios. 1. Proxy\nVoting Policy The policy of each Trust is to delegate the responsibility for voting proxies relating to\nportfolio securities held by the Trusts to SSGA Funds Management, Inc., the Trusts' investment adviser (the\n\u201c Adviser \u201d ), subject to the Trustees' continuing oversight. 2. Fiduciary Duty The right to vote proxies\nwith respect to portfolio securities held by each Trust is an asset of the Trusts. The Adviser acts as a\nfiduciary of the Trusts and must vote proxies in a manner consistent with the best interest of the Trusts\nand its shareholders. 3. Proxy Voting Procedures A. At least annually, the Adviser shall present to the\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201c Board \u201d ) its policies, procedures and other guidelines for voting proxies ( \u201c\nPolicy \u201d ) and the Policy of any Sub-adviser (defined below) to which proxy voting authority has been\ndelegated (see Section 9 below). In addition, the Adviser shall notify the Board of material changes to its\nPolicy or the Policy of any Sub-adviser promptly and no later than the next regular meeting of the Board\nafter such amendment is implemented. B. At least annually, the Adviser shall present to the Board its policy\nfor managing the conflicts of interests that may arise through the Adviser's proxy voting activities. In\naddition, the Adviser shall report any Policy overrides involving portfolio securities held by the Trusts to\nthe Trustees at the next regular meeting of the Board after such override(s) occur. C. At least annually,\nthe Adviser shall inform the Trustees that a record is available for each proxy voted with respect to\nportfolio securities of each Trust during the year. Also see Section 5 below. 4. Revocation of Authority to\nVote The delegation by the Trustees of the authority to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities of the\nTrusts may be revoked by the Trustees, in whole or in part, at any time. 5. Annual Filing of Proxy Voting\nRecord The Adviser shall provide the required data for each proxy voted with respect to portfolio securities\nof a Trust to that respective Trust or its designated service provider in a timely manner and in a format\nacceptable to be filed in the Trust's annual proxy voting report on Form N-PX for the twelve-month period\nended June 30. Form N-PX is required to be filed not later than August 31 of each year. 6. Retention and\nOversight of Proxy Advisory Firms A. In considering whether to retain or continue retaining a particular\nproxy advisory firm, the Adviser will ascertain whether the proxy advisory firm has the capacity and\ncompetency to adequately analyze proxy issues, act as proxy voting agent as requested, and implement the\nPolicy.

In order to carry out     \n                                     their primary responsibilities, directors undertake activities that    \n                                     include setting strategy and providing guidance on strategic matters,  \n                                     selecting the CEO and other senior executives, overseeing executive    \n                                     management, creating a succession plan for the board and management,   \n                                     and providing effective oversight of material risks and opportunities  \n                                     relevant to their business. Further, good corporate governance         \n                                     necessitates the existence of effective internal controls and risk     \n  Effective Board Oversight          management systems, which should be governed by the board. \u00a0 We view   \n                                     board quality as a measure of director independence, director          \n                                     succession planning, board diversity, evaluations and refreshment,     \n                                     and company governance practices. We believe independent directors     \n                                     are crucial to good corporate governance; they help management         \n                                     establish sound corporate governance policies and practices. We        \n                                     believe a sufficiently independent board is key to effectively         \n                                     monitoring management, maintaining appropriate governance practices,   \n                                     and performing oversight functions necessary to protect shareholder    \n                                     interests. We also believe the right mix of skills, independence,      \n                                     diversity, and qualifications among directors provides boards with     \n                                     the knowledge and direct experience to manage risks and operating      \n                                     structures that are often complex and industry-specific. We vote for   \n                                     the (re-)election of directors on a case-by-case basis after           \n                                     considering various                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nC-6                                                                                                         \n     \n  7  \n     \n                                                                                                            \n                            factors set forth in this Policy, including, but not limited to, board          \n                            quality, general market practice, and availability of information on director   \n                            skills and expertise. When voting in director elections, we do so on behalf of  \n                            and in the best interest of the funds and client accounts we manage and do not  \n                            seek to change or influence control of the company.                             \n                            It is important for shareholders to receive timely and accurate reporting of a  \n                            company\u2019s financial performance and strategy so that they are able to assess    \n                            both the value and risk of their investment. In addition to information         \n                            related to strategy and performance, companies should also provide disclosure   \n  Disclosure                relating to their approach to corporate governance and shareholder rights.      \n                            Such information allows investors to determine whether their economic           \n                            interests have been protected by the board and provides insights into the       \n                            quality of the board\u2019s oversight of management. Ultimately, the board of        \n                            directors is accountable for the oversight and disclosure of the material       \n                            risks and opportunities faced by the company.                                   \n                            State Street Global Advisors believes it is in the best interest of             \n                            shareholders for companies to have appropriate shareholder rights and           \n                            accountability mechanisms in place. As a starting place for voting rights, it   \n                            is necessary for ownership rights to reflect one vote for one share to ensure   \n                            that economic interests and proxy voting power are aligned. This share          \n                            structure best supports the shareholders\u2019 right to exercise their proxy vote    \n                            on matters that are important to the protection of their investment such as     \n  Shareholder Protection    share issuances and other dilutive events, authorization of strategic           \n                            transactions, approval of a shareholder rights plan, and changes to the         \n                            corporate bylaws or charter, among others. In terms of accountability           \n                            mechanisms, we believe there should be annual elections of the full board of    \n                            directors. The ability to elect, remove and nominate directors on at least an   \n                            annual basis provides the appropriate checks and balances to ensure that the    \n                            board of directors are undertaking their responsibilities in the best           \n                            interests of their shareholders.                                                \n                            When voting our clients\u2019 proxies, we may be presented with shareholder          \n                            proposals at portfolio companies that must be evaluated on a case-by-case       \n  Shareholder Proposals     basis and in accordance with the principles set forth above. For proposals      \n                            related to commonly requested disclosure topics, we have also developed the     \n                            criteria found in Appendix A to assess the effectiveness of disclosure on such  \n                            topics in connection with these types of proposals.                             \n                            State Street Global Advisors\u2019 engagement activities provides a meaningful       \n                            shareholder tool that we believe protects and enhances the long-term economic   \n                            value of the holdings in our clients\u2019 accounts. We conduct issuer-specific      \n  Engagement                engagements with companies to discuss the principles set forth in this Policy,  \n                            including sustainability-related risks and opportunities. In addition, we       \n                            encourage issuers to increase the amount of direct communication board members  \n                            have with shareholders. We believe direct communication with                    \n                                                                                                            \nC-7                                                                                                         \n     \n  8  \n     \n                                                                                                            \n                                          executive board members and independent non-executive directors   \n                                          is critical to helping companies understand shareholder           \n                                          concerns.                                                         \n  Section I. Effective Board Oversight                                                                      \n                                          We believe independent directors are crucial to good corporate    \n                                          governance; they help management establish sound corporate        \n                                          governance policies and practices. We believe a sufficiently      \n                                          independent board is key to effectively monitoring management,    \n                                          maintaining appropriate governance practices, and performing      \n  Board Independence                      oversight functions necessary to protect shareholder interests.   \n                                          We have developed a set of criteria for determining board         \n                                          independence, which varies by region and/or local jurisdiction.   \n                                          These criteria generally follow relevant listing standards,       \n                                          local regulatory requirements and/or local market practice        \n                                          standards.

In assessing excessive tenure, we consider factors such   \n                       as the preponderance of long tenured directors, board refreshment practices, and     \n                       classified board structures.                                                         \n                       Generally, we may vote against age and term limits unless the company is found to    \n                       have poor board refreshment and director succession practices, and has a             \n                       preponderance of non-executive directors with excessively long tenures serving on    \n                       the board.                                                                           \n                       Director Time Commitments We consider if a company publicly discloses its director   \n                       time commitment policy (e.g., within corporate governance guidelines, proxy          \n                       statement, company website).

Service on a mutual fund board, the board of a   \n  UK investment trust or a Special Purpose            \n  Acquisition Company (SPAC) board is not considered  \n  when evaluating directors for excessive             \n  commitments.

Boards should also have a regular        \n                          evaluation process in place to assess the effectiveness of the board and the      \n                          skills of board members to address issues, such as emerging risks, changes to     \n                          corporate strategy, and diversification of operations and geographic footprint.   \n                          We believe nominating committees are best positioned to evaluate the skillset     \n                          and expertise of both existing and prospective board members. However, we may     \n                          take such considerations into account in certain circumstances, such as           \n                          contested elections.                                                              \n                          Oversight of Strategy and Risk We believe that risk management is a key function  \n                          of the board, which is responsible for setting the overall risk appetite of a     \n                          company and for providing oversight on the risk management process established    \n                          by senior executives at a company. We allow boards to have discretion regarding   \n  Board Accountability    the ways in which they provide oversight in this area. However, we expect         \n                          companies to disclose how the board provides oversight on its risk management     \n                          system and risk identification. Boards should also review existing and emerging   \n                          risks that evolve in tandem with the changing political and economic landscape    \n                          or as companies diversify or expand their operations into new areas.              \n                          As responsible stewards, we believe in the importance of effective risk           \n                          management and oversight of issues that are material to a company. To             \n                          effectively manage and assess the risk of our clients\u2019 portfolios, we expect our  \n                          portfolio companies to manage risks and opportunities that are material and       \n                          industry-specific and that have a demonstrated link to long-term value creation,  \n                          and to provide high-quality disclosure of this process to shareholders.           \n                          Consistent with this perspective, we may seek to engage with our portfolio        \n                                                                                                            \nC-11                                                                                                        \n      \n  12  \n      \n                                                      \n  companies to better understand how their boards     \n  are overseeing risks and opportunities the company  \n  has deemed to be material to its business or        \n  operations. If we believe that a company has        \n  failed to implement and communicate effective       \n  oversight of these risks, we may consider voting    \n  against the responsible directors. We may withhold  \n  votes from directors who we determine have been     \n  remiss in their duties.                             \n  We may vote against directors due to failure to     \n  demonstrate effective oversight in the following    \n  three areas for relevant companies:                 \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aGovernance                                       \n  \u2022 Climate risk management at companies in           \n  carbon-intensive industries5 or companies           \n  receiving shareholder proposals that exhibit        \n  significant misalignment with our TCFD disclosure   \n  assessment criteria                                 \n  \u2022 Human capital management at our largest global    \n  holdings                                            \n  When evaluating a board\u2019s oversight of risks and    \n  opportunities, we assess the following factors,     \n  based on disclosures by, and engagements with,      \n  portfolio companies:                                \n                                                      \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aOversees Long-term Strategy                      \n  \u2014 Articulates the material risks and opportunities  \n  and how those risks and opportunities fit into the  \n  firm\u2019s long-term business strategy                  \n  \u2014 Regularly assesses the effectiveness of the       \n  company\u2019s long-term strategy, and management\u2019s      \n  execution of this strategy                          \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aDemonstrates an Effective Oversight Process      \n  \u2014 Describes which committee(s) have oversight over  \n  specific risks and opportunities, as well as which  \n  topics are overseen and/or discussed at the         \n  full-board level                                    \n  \u2014 Includes risks and opportunities in board and/or  \n  committee agendas, and articulates how often        \n  specific topics are discussed at the committee      \n  and/or full-board level                             \n  5 State Street Global Advisors defines              \n  carbon-intensive industries as the following        \n  Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)      \n  subindustries:                                      \n  Electric Utilities, Integrated Oil &Gas,            \n  Multi-Utilities, Steel, Construction Materials,     \n  Independent Power Producers & Energy Traders, Oil   \n  & Gas Refining & Marketing, Oil & Gas Exploration   \n  & Production, Diversified Metals & Mining,          \n  Airlines, Commodity Chemicals, Industrial Gases,    \n  Aluminum, Oil & Gas Storage & Transportation,       \n  Multi-Sector Holdings, Diversified Chemicals,       \n  Fertilizers & Agricultural Chemicals, Air Freight   \n  & Logistics, Agricultural Products, Environmental   \n  & Facilities Services, Coal & Consumable Fuels,     \n  Paper Packaging, Railroads, Marine, Automotive      \n  Retail, Oil & Gas Drilling, Food Retail, Paper      \n  Products, Hotels, Resorts & Cruise Lines, Internet  \n  & Direct Marketing Retail, Hypermarkets &           \n  Supercenters, Precious Metals & Minerals.           \n                                                      \nC-12                                                                                                        \n      \n  13  \n      \n                                                      \n  \u2014 Utilizes KPIs or metrics to assess the            \n  effectiveness of risk management processes          \n  \u2014 Engages with key stakeholders including           \n  employees and investors                             \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aEnsures Effective Leadership                     \n  \u2014 Holds management accountable for progress on      \n  relevant metrics and targets                        \n  \u2014 Integrates necessary skills and perspectives      \n  into the board nominating and executive hiring      \n  processes, and provides training to directors and   \n  executives on topics material to the company\u2019s      \n  business or operations                              \n  \u2014\u2009\u2009Conducts a periodic effectiveness review         \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aEnsures Disclosures of Material Information      \n  \u2014 Ensures publication of relevant disclosures,      \n  including those regarding material topics           \n  \u2014 For example, we expect companies to disclose      \n  against the four pillars of the Task Force on       \n  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)        \n  framework.                                          \n  Proxy Contests We believe nominating committees     \n  that are comprised of independent directors are     \n  best placed to assess which individuals can         \n  properly fulfill the duties of the board, and act   \n  as effective fiduciaries. As long-term              \n  shareholders, we vote proxies in director           \n  elections, including related to nominating          \n  committee members, who play a critical role in      \n  determining board composition. While our default    \n  position is to support the committees\u2019 judgement,   \n  we consider the following factors when evaluating   \n  dissident nominees:                                 \n                                                      \n  \u2022 Strategy presented by dissident nominees versus   \n  that of current management, as overseen by the      \n  incumbent board                                     \n  \u2022 Effectiveness, quality, and experience of the     \n  management slate                                    \n  \u2022 Material governance failures and the level of     \n  responsiveness to shareholder concerns and market   \n  signals by the incumbent board                      \n  \u2022 Quality of disclosure and engagement practices    \n  to support changes to shareholder rights, capital   \n  allocation and/or governance structure              \n  \u2022 Company performance and, if applicable, the       \n  merit of a recovery plan                            \n  Board Oversight of Geopolitical Risk As stewards    \n  of our clients\u2019 assets, we are aware of the         \n  financial risks associated with geopolitical risk,  \n  including risks arising from unexpected conflict    \n  between or among nations.

Despite the        \n  differences among the possible types of plans and   \n  the awards, there is a simple underlying            \n  philosophy that guides our analysis of executive    \n  compensation:                                       \n  we believe that there should be a direct            \n  relationship between executive compensation and     \n  company performance over the long term.             \n  Shareholders should have the opportunity to assess  \n  whether pay structures and levels are aligned with  \n  business performance. When assessing remuneration   \n  reports, we consider factors such as adequate       \n  disclosure of various remuneration elements,        \n  absolute and relative pay levels, peer selection    \n  and benchmarking, the mix of long-term and          \n  short-term incentives, alignment of pay structures  \n  with shareholder interests, as well as with         \n  corporate strategy and performance. We may oppose   \n  remuneration reports where pay seems misaligned     \n  with shareholders\u2019 interests. We may also consider  \n  executive compensation practices when re-electing   \n  members of the compensation committee.              \n  For example, criteria we may consider include the   \n  following:                                          \n                                                      \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aOverall quantum relative to company performance  \n  \u2022 Vesting periods and length of performance         \n  targets                                             \n  \u2022 Mix of performance, time and options-based stock  \n  units                                               \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aUse of special grants and one-time awards        \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aRetesting and repricing features                 \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aDisclosure and transparency                      \n  Board Responsiveness to Advisory Votes              \n  a. Executive Pay                                    \n  We may vote against the re-election of members of   \n  the compensation committee if we have serious       \n  concerns about remuneration practices and if the    \n  company has not been responsive to shareholder      \n  feedback to review its approach. In addition, if    \n  the level of dissent against a management proposal  \n  on executive pay is consistently high, and we have  \n  determined that a vote against a pay-related        \n  proposal is warranted in the third consecutive      \n  year, we may vote against the Chair of the          \n  compensation committee.                             \n                                                      \nC-14                                                                                                        \n      \n  15  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n                                   b.

In  \n                                   addition to information related to strategy and performance, companies   \n                                   should provide disclosure relating to their approach to corporate        \n  Section II.

As a         \n  result, we have a longstanding commitment to        \n  enhancing investor-useful disclosure around this    \n  topic.                                              \n  We find that the recommendations of the Taskforce   \n  on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)     \n  provide an effective framework for disclosure of    \n  climate-related risks and opportunities. We         \n  believe all companies should provide public         \n  disclosures in accordance with the following four   \n  pillars of the Taskforce for Climate-related        \n  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework:             \n  \u2022 Governance The TCFD recommends companies          \n  describe the board\u2019s oversight of, and              \n  management\u2019s role in, assessing and managing        \n  climate-related risks and opportunities.            \n  \u2022 Strategy The TCFD recommends companies describe   \n  identified climate-related risks and opportunities  \n  and the impact of these risks and opportunities on  \n  their businesses, strategy, and financial           \n  planning.                                           \n  \u2022 Risk Management The TCFD recommends companies     \n  describe processes for identifying, assessing, and  \n  managing climate-related risks and describe how     \n  these processes are integrated into overall risk    \n  management.                                         \n  \u2022 Metrics and Targets The TCFD recommends           \n  companies disclose metrics and targets used to      \n  assess and manage climate-related risks and         \n  opportunities.                                      \n  \u2014 State Street Global Advisors is not prescriptive  \n  on target setting. We expect companies that have    \n  adopted net zero ambitions to disclose interim      \n  climate targets.6 If a company chooses not to       \n  disclose any climate targets, we expect the         \n  company to provide an explanation on how the        \n  company measures and monitors progress on managing  \n  climate-related risks and opportunities in line     \n  with the recommendations of TCFD.                   \n  \u2014 TCFD recommends the disclosure of Scope 1, Scope  \n  2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 emissions. We       \n  expect companies to identify and disclose the most  \n  relevant categories of Scope 3 emissions as         \n  defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate    \n  Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting      \n  Standard. However, we recognize that Scope 3        \n  emissions estimates have a high degree of           \n  uncertainty; therefore, if the company determines   \n  that categories of Scope 3 are impracticable to     \n  estimate, we instead encourage companies to         \n  explain these limitations. We do not expect         \n  companies to set Scope 3 targets. We do encourage   \n  companies to explain any efforts to address Scope   \n  3 emissions in line with TCFD, such as engagement   \n  with suppliers, customers, or other stakeholders    \n  across the value chain, where relevant.             \n  6. \u201cNet zero ambitions\u201d are defined by State        \n  Street Global Advisors as a public                  \n  statement/commitment to align the company\u2019s         \n  emissions to third party frameworks or pathways     \n  for net zero.                                       \n                                                      \nC-16                                                                                                        \n      \n  17  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n                                         We may take voting action against directors serving at companies   \n                                         in the following indexes that fail to provide sufficient           \n                                         disclosure regarding: (i)\u00a0board oversight of climate-related       \n                                         risks and opportunities; (ii)\u00a0total direct and indirect GHG        \n                                         emissions (\u201cScope 1\u201d and \u201cScope 2\u201d emissions); (iii)               \n                                         climate-related targets, in accordance with the TCFD framework:    \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aS&P 500                                                         \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aS&P/TSX Composite                                               \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aFTSE 350                                                        \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aSTOXX 600                                                       \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aASX 200                                                         \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aTOPIX 100                                                       \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aHang Seng                                                       \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aStraits Times Index                                             \n                                         We may waive the guideline if a company engages with State Street  \n                                         Global Advisors and provides a specific, timebound plan for        \n                                         providing the expected disclosures.                                \n                                         Say-on-Climate Proposals While we are generally supportive of      \n                                         effective climate- related disclosure, we currently do not         \n                                         endorse an annual advisory climate vote. We have reservations      \n                                         with the potential unintended consequences of such a vote,         \n                                         including insulating directors from accountability, distracting    \n                                         from existing disclosure frameworks, and straining investors\u2019      \n                                         limited proxy voting resources.

The approval of capital       \n                                         raising activities is fundamental to a shareholder\u2019s               \n                                                                                                            \nC-17                                                                                                        \n      \n  18  \n      \n                                                      \n  ability to monitor the amounts of proceeds and to   \n  ensure capital is deployed efficiently. Altering    \n  the capital structure of a company is a critical    \n  decision for boards. When making such a decision,   \n  we believe the company should disclose a            \n  comprehensive business rationale that is            \n  consistent with corporate strategy and not overly   \n  dilutive to its shareholders.                       \n  Our approach to share capital structure matters     \n  may vary by local market and jurisdiction, due to   \n  regional nuances. Such proposals may include:       \n                                                      \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aIncrease in Authorized Common Shares             \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aIncrease in Authorized Preferred Shares          \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aUnequal Voting Rights                            \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aShare Repurchase Programs                        \n  Dividend Payouts We generally support dividend      \n  payouts that constitute 30 percent or more of net   \n  income. We may vote against a dividend payout if    \n  the dividend payout ratio has been consistently     \n  below 30 percent without adequate explanation. We   \n  may also vote against if the payout is excessive    \n  given the company\u2019s financial position. Particular  \n  attention will be warranted when the payment may    \n  damage the company\u2019s long-term financial health.    \n  Reorganization, Mergers and Acquisitions The        \n  reorganization of the structure of a company or     \n  mergers often involve proposals relating to         \n  reincorporation, restructurings, liquidations, and  \n  other major changes to the corporation.             \n  Proposals that are in the best interests of the     \n  shareholders, demonstrated by enhancing share       \n  value or improving the effectiveness of the         \n  company\u2019s operations, will generally be supported.  \n  We evaluate mergers and structural reorganizations  \n  on a case-by-case basis. We will generally support  \n  transactions that maximize shareholder value. Some  \n  of the considerations include the following:        \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aOffer premium                                    \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aStrategic rationale                              \n  \u2022 Board oversight of the process for the            \n  recommended transaction, including, director and/   \n  or management conflicts of interest                 \n  \u2022 Offers made at a premium and where there are no   \n  other higher bidders                                \n  \u2022 Offers in which the secondary market price is     \n  substantially lower than the net asset value        \n                                                      \nC-18                                                                                                        \n      \n  19  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n                        We may vote against a transaction considering the following:                        \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aOffers with potentially damaging consequences for minority shareholders because  \n                        of illiquid stock                                                                   \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aOffers where we believe there is a reasonable prospect for an enhanced bid or    \n                        other bidders                                                                       \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aThe current market price of the security exceeds the bid price at the time of    \n                        voting                                                                              \n                        Related-Party Transactions Some companies have a controlled ownership structure     \n                        and complex cross-shareholdings between subsidiaries and parent companies           \n                        (\u201crelated companies\u201d). Such structures may result in the prevalence of              \n                        related-party transactions between the company and its various stakeholders, such   \n                        as directors and management, subsidiaries and shareholders. In markets where        \n                        shareholders are required to approve such transactions, we expect companies to      \n                        disclose details of the transaction, such as the nature, the value and the purpose  \n                        of such a transaction. We also encourage independent directors to ratify such       \n                        transactions. Further, we encourage companies to describe the level of independent  \n                        board oversight and the approval process, including details of any independent      \n                        valuations provided by financial advisors on related-party transactions.            \n                        Cross-Shareholdings (Japan Only) \u201cCross-shareholdings\u201d are a long-standing feature  \n                        of the balance sheets of many Japanese companies, but, in our view, can be          \n                        detrimental for corporate governance practices and ultimately shareholder returns.  \n                        Therefore, State Street Global Advisors may vote against the board leader at the    \n                        TOPIX 500 companies where the \u201ccross-shareholdings\u201d (strategic listed shares) held  \n                        by a company exceed 30\u00a0percent of the company\u2019s net assets (as in the securities    \n                        report disclosed for the previous fiscal year).                                     \n                        We may waive the guideline if a company engages with State Street Global Advisors   \n                        and provides a specific, timebound, and publicly available plan for reducing its    \n                        exposure to \u201ccross-shareholdings\u201d:                                                  \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aTo less than 30% by 2025; or                                                     \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aBy 50% of current level by 2025                                                  \n                        Proxy Access (North America Only) In general, we believe that proxy access is a     \n                        fundamental right and an accountability mechanism for all long-term shareholders.   \n  Shareholder Rights    We consider proposals relating to proxy access on a case-by-case basis. We          \n                        generally support shareholder proposals that set parameters to empower long-term    \n                        shareholders while providing management the flexibility to design a process that    \n                        is appropriate for the company\u2019s circumstances.                                     \n                                                                                                            \nC-19                                                                                                        \n      \n  20  \n      \n                                                      \n  Vote Standards                                      \n  a. Annual Elections We generally support the        \n  establishment of annual elections of the board of   \n  directors. Consideration is given to the overall    \n  level of board independence and the independence    \n  of the key committees, as well as the existence of  \n  a shareholder rights plan.                          \n  b. Majority Voting We generally support a majority  \n  vote standard based on votes cast for the election  \n  of directors. We generally vote to support          \n  amendments to bylaws that would require simple      \n  majority of voting shares (i.e. shares cast) to     \n  pass or to repeal certain provisions.               \n  Shareholder Meetings                                \n  a. Special Meetings and Written Consent In          \n  general, we support the ability for shareholders    \n  to call special meetings, as well as act by         \n  written consent. We believe an appropriate          \n  threshold for both calling a special meeting and    \n  acting by written consent can be 25% of             \n  outstanding shares or less.                         \n  b. Notice Period to Convene a General Meeting We    \n  expect companies to give as much notice as is       \n  practicable when calling a general meeting.         \n  Generally, we are not supportive of authorizations  \n  seeking to reduce the notice period to less than    \n  14 days.                                            \n  c. Virtual/Hybrid Shareholder Meetings We           \n  generally support proposals that grant boards the   \n  right to hold shareholder meetings in a virtual or  \n  hybrid format as long as companies uphold the       \n  following best practices:                           \n  \u2022 Afford virtual attendee shareholders the same     \n  rights as would normally be granted to in-person    \n  attendee shareholders                               \n  \u2022 Commit to time-bound renewal (five years or       \n  less) of meeting format authorization by            \n  shareholders                                        \n  \u2022 Provide a written record of all questions posed   \n  during the meeting, and                             \n  \u2022 Comply with local market laws and regulations     \n  relating to virtual and hybrid shareholder meeting  \n  practices                                           \n  \u2022 If a company breaches any of the criteria above,  \n  we may vote against the chair of the nominating     \n  committee.                                          \n  \u2022 In evaluating these proposals we also consider    \n  the operating environment of the company,           \n  including local regulatory developments and         \n  specific market circumstances impacting virtual     \n  meeting practices.                                  \n                                                      \nC-20                                                                                                        \n      \n  21  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n  Governance Documents & Miscellaneous    Article Amendments                                                \n  Items                                                                                                     \n                                          a. Unilateral Amendments We may withhold votes from directors of  \n                                          companies that have unilaterally adopted/amended company bylaws   \n                                          that negatively impact shareholder rights (such as fee-shifting,  \n                                          forum selection, and exclusion service bylaws) without putting    \n                                          such amendments to a shareholder vote.                            \n                                          b. Super-Majority We generally vote against amendments to bylaws  \n                                          requiring super-majority shareholder votes to pass or repeal      \n                                          certain provisions. \u00a0 We generally vote for the reduction or      \n                                          elimination of super-majority vote requirements, unless           \n                                          management of the issuer was concurrently seeking to or had       \n                                          previously made such a reduction or elimination.                  \n                                          c. Board Size We generally support proposals seeking to fix the   \n                                          board size or designate a range for the board size and vote       \n                                          against proposals that give management the ability to alter the   \n                                          size of the board outside of a specified range without            \n                                          shareholder approval.                                             \n                                          Anti-Takeover Issues Occasionally, companies add anti-takeover    \n                                          provisions that reduce the chances of a potential acquirer to     \n                                          make an offer, or to reduce the likelihood of a successful        \n                                          offer. We generally do not support proposals that reduce          \n                                          shareholders\u2019 rights, entrench management, or reduce the          \n                                          likelihood of shareholders\u2019 right to vote on reasonable offers.   \n                                          Our approach to anti-takeover issues may vary by local market     \n                                          and jurisdiction, due to regional nuances. However, we will       \n                                          generally support mandates requiring shareholder approval of a    \n                                          shareholder rights plans (\u201cpoison pill\u201d) and repeals of various   \n                                          anti-takeover related provisions.                                 \n                                          When appropriate, we may vote for an amendment to a shareholder   \n                                          rights plan where the terms of the new plans are more favorable   \n                                          to shareholders\u2019 ability to accept unsolicited offers (i.e., if   \n                                          one of the following conditions are met: (i)\u00a0minimum trigger,     \n                                          flip-in or flip-over of 20\u00a0percent, (ii)\u00a0maximum term of three    \n                                          years, (iii)\u00a0no \u201cdead hand,\u201d \u201cslow hand,\u201d \u201cno hand\u201d nor similar   \n                                          feature that limits the ability of a future board to redeem the   \n                                          pill, and (iv)\u00a0inclusion of a shareholder redemption feature      \n                                          (qualifying offer clause), permitting ten percent of the shares   \n                                          to call a special meeting or seek a written consent to vote on    \n                                          rescinding the pill if the board refuses to redeem the pill 90    \n                                          days after a qualifying offer is announced).                      \n                                          Accounting and Audit-Related Issues Companies should have robust  \n                                          internal audit and internal control systems designed for          \n                                          effective management of any potential and emerging risks to       \n                                          company operations and strategy. The responsibility of setting    \n                                          out an internal audit function lies with the audit committee,     \n                                          which should have independent non-executive directors designated  \n                                          as members.                                                       \n                                          We believe the disclosure and availability of reliable financial  \n                                          statements in a timely manner is imperative for investment        \n                                          analysis. As a result, board oversight of the internal controls   \n                                          and the independence of the audit process are essential if        \n                                          investors are to rely upon financial statements.

When appointing external auditors and         \n                                       approving audit fees, we will take into consideration the level of   \n                                       detail in company disclosures.

Board of Directors\n\nVoting on Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections\n\nFour fundamental principles apply when determining votes on director nominees:\n\nIndependence:Boards should be sufficiently independent from management (and significant shareholders) to\nensure that they are able and motivated to effectively supervise management\u2019s performance for the benefit of\nall shareholders, including in setting and monitoring the execution of corporate strategy, with appropriate\nuse of shareholder capital, and in setting and monitoring executive compensation programs that support that\nstrategy. The chair of the board should ideally be an independent director, and all boards should have an\nindependent leadership position or a similar role in order to help provide appropriate counterbalance to\nexecutive management, as well as having sufficiently independent committees that focus on key governance\nconcerns such as audit, compensation, and nomination of directors.\n\nComposition:Companies should ensure that directors add value to the board through their specific skills and\nexpertise and by having sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. Boards should be of a size\nappropriate to accommodate diversity, expertise, and independence, while ensuring active and collaborative\nparticipation by all members. Boards should be sufficiently diverse to ensure consideration of a wide range\nof perspectives.\n\nResponsiveness:Directors should respond to investor input, such as that expressed through significant\nopposition to management proposals, significant support for shareholder proposals (whether binding or non-\nbinding),and tender offers where a majority of shares are tendered.\n\nAccountability:Boards should be sufficiently accountable to shareholders, including through transparency of\nthe company\u2019s governance practices and regular board elections, by the provision of sufficient information\nfor shareholders to be able to assess directors and board composition, and through the ability of\nshareholders to remove directors.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for director nominees, except under the following circumstances (with\nnew nominees 1 considered on case-by-casebasis):\n\nIndependence\n\nVote againstor withhold from non-independentdirectors (Executive Directors and Non-Independent Non-\nExecutiveDirectors perISS\u2019 Classification of Directors) when:\n                                                                         \n  \u25fe    Independent directors comprise 50\u00a0percent or less of the board;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                                                  \n  \u25fe    The non-independent director serves on the audit, compensation, or nominating committee;  \n                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so that the full board functions  \n        as that committee; or                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    The company lacks a formal nominating committee, even if the board attests that the independent     \n        directors fulfill the functions of such a committee.                                                \n                                                                                                            \n1 A \u201cnew nominee\u201d is a director who is being presented for election by shareholders for the first time.\nRecommendations on new nominees who have served for less than one year are made on a case-by-case basis\ndepending on the timing of their appointment and the problematic governance issue in question.\n\n2 In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use \u201cWithhold\u201d as the contrary vote option in\ndirector elections; companies with a majority vote standard use \u201cAgainst\u201d. However, it will vary by company\nand the proxy must be checked to determine the valid contrary vote option for the particular company.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Current interim officers are included in this category. For private companies, the equivalent\npositions are applicable. A non-employee director serving as an officer due to statutory requirements (e.g.\ncorporate secretary) will generally be classified as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director under \u201cAny\nmaterial relationship with the company.\u201d However, if the company provides explicit disclosure that the\ndirector is not receiving additional compensation exceeding $10,000 per year for serving in that capacity,\nthen the director will be classified as an Independent Director.\n\n2. \u201cAffiliate\u201d includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. ISS uses 50 percent control\nownership by the parent company as the standard for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor\nof an externally managed issuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate.\n\n3. Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the company\u2019s initial public offering (IPO).\n\n4. When there is a former CEO of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) serving on the board of an\nacquired company, ISS will generally classify such directors as independent unless determined otherwise\ntaking into account the following factors: the applicable listing standards determination of such director\u2019s\nindependence; any operating ties to the firm; and the existence of any other conflicting relationships or\nrelated party transactions.\n\n5.ISS will look at the terms of the interim officer\u2019s employment contract to determine if it contains\nseverance pay, long-term health and pension benefits, or other such standard provisions typically contained\nin contracts of permanent, non-temporary CEOs. ISS will also consider if a formal search process was under\nway for a full-time officer at the time.\n\n6.\u201cImmediate family member\u201d follows the SEC\u2019s definition of such and covers spouses, parents, children,\nstep-parents, step-children, siblings, in-laws, and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the\nhousehold of any director, nominee for director, executive officer, or significant shareholder of the\ncompany.\n\n7. Professional services can be characterized as advisory in nature, generally involve access to sensitive\ncompany information or to strategic decision-making, and typically have a commission- or fee-based payment\nstructure. Professional services generally include but are not limited to the following: investment\nbanking/financial advisory services, commercial banking (beyond deposit services), investment services,\ninsurance services, accounting/audit services, consulting services, marketing services, legal services,\nproperty management services, realtor services, lobbying services, executive search services, and IT\nconsulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional relationships and not\nprofessional services: deposit services, IT tech support services, educational services, and construction\nservices. The case of participation in a banking syndicate by a non-lead bank should be considered a\ntransactional (and hence subject to the associated materiality test) rather than a professional\nrelationship. \u201cOf Counsel\u201d relationships are only considered immaterial if the individual does not receive\nany form of compensation (in excess of $10,000 per year) from, or is a retired partner of, the firm\nproviding the professional service. The case of a company providing a professional service to one of its\ndirectors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated, will be considered a transactional\nrather than a professional relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be\nprofessional services unless the company explains why such services are not advisory.\n\n8. A material transactional relationship, including grants to non-profit organizations, exists if the\ncompany makes annual payments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity, exceeding the greater\nof: $200,000 or 5 percent of the recipient\u2019s gross revenues, for a company that follows NASDAQ listing\nstandards; or the greater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient\u2019s gross revenues, for a company that\nfollows NYSE listing standards. For a company that follows neither of the preceding standards, ISS will\napply the NASDAQ-based materiality test. (The recipient is the party receiving the financial proceeds from\nthe transaction).\n\n9. Dissident directors who are parties to a voting agreement pursuant to a settlement or similar arrangement\nmay be classified as Independent Directors if an analysis of the following factors indicates that the voting\nagreement does not compromise their alignment with all shareholders\u2019 interests: the terms of the agreement;\nthe duration of the standstill provision in the agreement; the limitations and requirements of actions that\nare agreed upon; if the dissident director nominee(s) is subject to the standstill; and if there any\nconflicting relationships or related party transactions.\n\n10.Interlocks include: executive officers serving as directors on each other\u2019s compensation or similar\ncommittees (or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board); or executive officers sitting on each\nother\u2019s boards and at least one serves on the other\u2019s compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence\nof such a committee, on the board).\n\n11.

An exception\nwill be made if there was at least one woman on the board at the preceding annual meeting and the board\nmakes a firm commitment to return to a gender-diverse status within a year.\n\nRacial and/or Ethnic Diversity:For companies in the Russell 3000 or S&P 1500 indices, generally vote against\nor withhold from the chair of the nominating committee (or other directors on a case-by-casebasis) where the\nboard has no apparent racially or ethnically diverse members 5. An exception will be made if there was\nracial and/or ethnic diversity on the board at the preceding annual meeting and the board makes a firm\ncommitment to appoint at least one racial and/or ethnic diverse member within a year.\n\n3 Nominees who served for only part of the fiscal year are generally exempted from the attendance policy.\n\n4 Although all of a CEO\u2019s subsidiary boards with publicly-traded common stock will be counted as separate\nboards, ISS will not recommend a withhold vote for the CEO of a parent company board or any of the\ncontrolled (>50 percent ownership) subsidiaries of that parent but may do so at subsidiaries that are less\nthan 50 percent controlled and boards outside the parent/subsidiary relationships.\n\n5 Aggregate diversity statistics provided by the board will only be considered if specific to racial and/or\nethnic diversity.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Shareholder Rights & Defenses\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals/Nominations\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon advance notice proposals, giving support to those proposals which\nallow shareholders to submit proposals/nominations as close to the meeting date as reasonably possible and\nwithin the broadest window possible, recognizing the need to allow sufficient notice for company,\nregulatory, and shareholder review.\n\nTo be reasonable, the company\u2019s deadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/nominations must be no earlier\nthan 120 days prior to the anniversary of the previous year\u2019s meeting and have a submittal window of no\nshorter than 30 days from the beginning of the notice period (also known as a 90-120-day window). The\nsubmittal window is the period under which shareholders must file their proposals/nominations prior to the\ndeadline.\n\nIn general, support additional efforts by companies to ensure full disclosure in regard to a proponent\u2019s\neconomic and voting position in the company so long as the informational requirements are reasonable and\naimed at providing shareholders with the necessary information to review such proposals.\n\nAmend Bylaws without Shareholder Consent\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote against proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws.\n\nVote case-by-case on proposals giving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition to shareholders,\ntaking into account the following:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Any impediments to shareholders\u2019 ability to amend the bylaws (i.e. supermajority voting             \n        requirements);                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                          \n  \u25fe    The company\u2019s ownership structure and historical voting turnout;  \n                                                                          \n                                                                           \n  \u25fe    Whether the board could amend bylaws adopted by shareholders; and  \n                                                                           \n                                                                                                 \n  \u25fe    Whether shareholders would retain the ability to ratify any board-initiated amendments.  \n                                                                                                 \nControl Share Acquisition Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing so\nwould enable the completion of a takeover that would be detrimental to shareholders.\n\nVote against proposals to amend the charter to include control share acquisition provisions.\n\nVote for proposals to restore voting rights to the control shares.\n\nControl share acquisition statutes function by denying shares their voting rights when they contribute to\nownership in excess of certain thresholds. Voting rights for those shares exceeding ownership limits may\nonly be restored by approval of either a majority or supermajority of disinterested shares. Thus, control\nshare acquisition statutes effectively require a hostile bidder to put its offer to a shareholder vote or\nrisk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder continues buying up a large block of shares.\n\nControl Share Cash-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share cash-outstatutes.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

In other words, when an investor\ncrosses a preset threshold level, remaining shareholders are given the right to sell their shares to the\nacquirer, who must buy them at the highest acquiring price.\n\nDisgorgement Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state disgorgement provisions.\n\nDisgorgement provisions require an acquirer or potential acquirer of more than a certain percentage of a\ncompany\u2019s stock to disgorge, or pay back, to the company any profits realized from the sale of that\ncompany\u2019s stock purchased 24 months before achieving control status. All sales of company stock by the\nacquirer occurring within a certain period of time (between 18 months and 24 months) prior to the investor\u2019s\ngaining control status are subject to these recapture-of-profits provisions.\n\nFair Price Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon proposals to adopt fair price provisions (provisions that\nstipulate that an acquirer must pay the same price to acquire all shares as it paid to acquire the control\nshares), evaluating factors such as the vote required to approve the proposed acquisition, the vote required\nto repeal the fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair price.\n\nGenerally vote against fair price provisions with shareholder vote requirements greater than a majority of\ndisinterested shares.\n\nFreeze-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state freeze-outprovisions. Freeze-outprovisions\nforce an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a company to wait a specified period of\ntime before gaining control of the company.\n\nGreenmail\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments or otherwise\nrestrict a company\u2019s ability to make greenmail payments.\n\nVote case-by-case on anti-greenmail proposals when they are bundled with other charter or bylaw amendments.\n\nGreenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock from individuals or groups\nseeking control of the company. Since only the hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial\npremium over the market value of its shares, the practice discriminates against all other shareholders.\n\nShareholder Litigation Rights\n\nFederal Forum Selection Provisions\n\nFederal forum selection provisions require that U.S. federal courts be the sole forum for shareholders to\nlitigate claims arising under federal securities law.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

The comprehensiveness  \n        of the sales process (e.g., full auction, partial auction, no auction) can also affect shareholder  \n        value.                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Conflicts of interest - Are insiders benefiting from the transaction disproportionately and         \n        inappropriately as compared to non-insider shareholders? As the result of potential conflicts, the  \n        directors and officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a merger than if they   \n  \u25fe    did not hold these interests. Consider whether these interests may have influenced these directors  \n        and officers to support or recommend the merger. The CIC figure presented in the \u201cISS Transaction   \n        Summary\u201d section of this report is an aggregate figure that can in certain cases be a misleading    \n        indicator of the true value transfer from shareholders to insiders. Where such figure appears to    \n        be excessive, analyze the underlying assumptions to determine whether a potential conflict exists.  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

Additionally, a private company discount may be applied to the        \n        target if it is a private entity.                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Market reaction - How has the market responded to the proposed deal? A negative market reaction     \n  \u25fe    may be a cause for concern. Market reaction may be addressed by analyzing the one-day impact on     \n        the unaffected stock price.                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Deal timing - A main driver for most transactions is that the SPAC charter typically requires the   \n  \u25fe    deal to be complete within 18 to 24 months, or the SPAC is to be liquidated. Evaluate the           \n        valuation, market reaction, and potential conflicts of interest for deals that are announced close  \n        to the liquidation date.                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Negotiations and process - What was the process undertaken to identify potential target companies   \n  \u25fe    within specified industry or location specified in charter? Consider the background of the          \n        sponsors.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Conflicts of interest - How are sponsors benefiting from the transaction compared to IPO            \n        shareholders? Potential conflicts could arise if a fairness opinion is issued by the insiders to    \n        qualify the deal rather than a third party or if management is encouraged to pay a higher price     \n  \u25fe    for the target because of an 80\u00a0percent rule (the charter requires that the fair market value of    \n        the target is at least equal to 80\u00a0percent of net assets of the SPAC). Also, there may be sense of  \n        urgency by the management team of the SPAC to close the deal since its charter typically requires   \n        a transaction to be completed within the 18-24-month timeframe.                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Voting agreements - Are the sponsors entering into enter into any voting agreements/tender offers   \n  \u25fe    with shareholders who are likely to vote against the proposed merger or exercise conversion         \n        rights?                                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Governance - What is the impact of having the SPAC CEO or founder on key committees following the   \n        proposed merger?                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

Other times,    \n        the SPAC has entered into a definitive transaction agreement, but needs additional time to          \n        consummate or hold the shareholder meeting.                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Added incentive for non-redeeming shareholders: Sometimes the SPAC sponsor (or other insiders)      \n        will contribute, typically as a loan to the company, additional funds that will be added to the     \n  \u25fe    redemption value of each public share as long as such shares are not redeemed in connection with    \n        the extension request.

SVT is expressed as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of market value, and\nincludes the new shares proposed, shares available under existing plans, and shares granted but unexercised\n(using two measures, in the case of plans subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, as noted above).\nAll award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are placed on the most expensive types of\nawards (for example, full-value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be granted will be the\nmost expensive types.\n\nFor proposals that are not subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value Transfer is\nreasonable if it falls below a company-specific benchmark. The benchmark is determined as follows: The top\nquartile performers in each industry group (using the Global Industry Classification Standard: GICS) are\nidentified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are established based on these top performers\u2019 historic\nSVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most strongly correlated\nto SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the specific company by\nplugging the company-specific performance measures, size, and cash compensation into the industry cap\nequations to arrive at the company\u2019s benchmark.22\n\nThree-Year Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\n\nA \u201cValue-Adjusted Burn Rate\u201d is used for stock plan evaluations. Value-Adjusted Burn Rate benchmarks are\ncalculated as the greater of: (1) an industry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the\ncompany\u2019s GICS group segmented by S&P 500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&P 500) and non-Russell 3000 index;\nand (2) a de minimisthreshold established separately for each of the S&P 500, the Russell 3000 index less\nthe S&P 500, and the non-Russell 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-rate benchmark changes will be limited to a\npredetermined range above or below the prior year\u2019s burn-rate benchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate is calculated as follows:\n\nValue-Adjusted Burn Rate = ((# of options * option\u2019s dollar value using a Black-Scholes model) + (# of full-\nvalue awards * stock price)) / (Weighted average common shares * stock price).\n\nEgregious Factors\n\nLiberal Change in Control Definition\n\nGenerally vote against equity plans if the plan has a liberal definition of change in control and the equity\nawards could vest upon such liberal definition of change in control, even though an actual change in control\nmay not occur. Examples of such a definition include, but are not limited to, announcement or commencement\nof a tender offer, provisions for acceleration upon a \u201cpotential\u201d takeover, shareholder approval of a merger\nor other transactions, or similar language.\n\n22 For plans evaluated under the Equity Plan Scorecard policy, the company\u2019s SVT benchmark is considered\nalong with other factors.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

The proposal should clearly articulate why the board is choosing to conduct an exchange program at\nthis point in time. Repricing underwater options after a recent precipitous drop in the company\u2019s stock\nprice demonstrates poor timing and warrants additional scrutiny. Also, consider the terms of the surrendered\noptions, such as the grant date, exercise price and vesting schedule. Grant dates of surrendered options\nshould be far enough back (two to three years) so as not to suggest that repricings are being done to take\nadvantage of short-term downward price movements. Similarly, the exercise price of surrendered options\nshould be above the 52-week high for the stock price.\n\nVote for shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.\n\nStock Plans in Lieu of Cash\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon plans that provide participants with the option of taking all or\na portion of their cash compensation in the form of stock.\n\nVote for non-employee director-only equity plans that provide a dollar-for-dollar cash-for-stock exchange.\n\nVote case-by-case on plans which do not provide a dollar-for-dollar cash for stock exchange.

In an effort to capture the total cost of total\ncompensation, ISS will not make any adjustments to carve out the in-lieu-of cash compensation.\n\nTransfer Stock Option (TSO) Programs\n\nGeneral Recommendation:One-timeTransfers: Vote against or withhold from compensation committee members if\nthey fail to submit one-timetransfers to shareholders for approval.\n\nVote case-by-case on one-time transfers.

Standard stock options    \n        and performance-accelerated awards do not meet the criteria to be considered as performance-based   \n        awards. Further, premium-priced options should have a meaningful premium to be considered           \n        performance-based awards.                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Second, assess the rigor of the company\u2019s performance-based equity program. If the bar set for the  \n        performance-based program is too low based on the company\u2019s historical or peer group comparison,    \n  \u25fe    generally vote for the proposal. Furthermore, if target performance results in an above target      \n        payout, vote for the shareholder proposal due to program\u2019s poor design. If the company does not     \n        disclose the performance metric of the performance-based equity program, vote for the shareholder   \n        proposal regardless of the outcome of the first step to the test.                                   \n                                                                                                            \nIn general, vote for the shareholder proposal if the company does not meet both of the above two steps.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Many companies have adopted policies that permit recoupment in cases where\nan executive\u2019s fraud, misconduct, or negligence significantly contributed to a restatement of financial\nresults that led to the awarding of unearned incentive compensation. However, such policies may be narrow\ngiven that not all misconduct or negligence may result in significant financial restatements.

Social and Environmental Issues\n\nGlobal Approach \u2013 E&S Shareholder Proposals\n\nISS applies a common approach globally to evaluating social and environmental proposals which cover a wide\nrange of topics, including consumer and product safety, environment and energy, labor standards and human\nrights, workplace and board diversity, and corporate political issues. While a variety of factors goes into\neach analysis, the overall principle guiding all vote recommendations focuses on how the proposal may\nenhance or protect shareholder value in either the short or long term.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote case-by-case,examining primarily whether implementation of the\nproposal is likely to enhance or protect shareholder value. The following factors will be considered:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    If the issues presented in the proposal are being appropriately or effectively dealt with through   \n        legislation or government regulation;                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    If the company has already responded in an appropriate and sufficient manner to the issue(s)        \n        raised in the proposal;                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                          \n  \u25fe    Whether the proposal\u2019s request is unduly burdensome (scope or timeframe) or overly prescriptive;  \n                                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    The company\u2019s approach compared with any industry standard practices for addressing the issue(s)    \n        raised by the proposal;                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Whether there are significant controversies, fines, penalties, or litigation associated with the    \n        company\u2019s practices related to the issue(s) raised in the proposal;                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        If the proposal requests increased disclosure or greater transparency, whether reasonable and       \n  \u25fe    sufficient information is currently available to shareholders from the company or from other        \n        publicly available sources; and                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        If the proposal requests increased disclosure or greater transparency, whether implementation       \n  \u25fe    would reveal proprietary or confidential information that could place the company at a competitive  \n        disadvantage.                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nEndorsement of Principles\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote against proposals seeking a company\u2019s endorsement of principles that\nsupport a particular public policy position. Endorsing a set of principles may require a company to take a\nstand on an issue that is beyond its own control and may limit its flexibility with respect to future\ndevelopments.\n\nManagement and the board should be afforded the flexibility to make decisions on specific public policy\npositions based on their own assessment of the most beneficial strategies for the company.\n\nAnimal Welfare\n\nAnimal Welfare Policies\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for proposals seeking a report on a company\u2019s animal welfare\nstandards, or animal welfare-related risks, unless:\n                                                                                                      \n  \u25fe    The company has already published a set of animal welfare standards and monitors compliance;  \n                                                                                                      \n                                                                       \n  \u25fe    The company\u2019s standards are comparable to industry peers; and  \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    There are no recent significant fines, litigation, or controversies related to the company\u2019s        \n        and/or its suppliers\u2019 treatment of animals.                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

Persons Controlled By or Under Common Control With Registrant The Board of Trustees of the Trust is\nthe same as the Boards of Trustees of SPDR Index Shares Funds and SSGA Active Trust. In addition, the\nofficers of the Trust are substantially identical to the officers of SPDR Index Shares Funds and SSGA Active\nTrust. Additionally, the Trust\u2019s investment adviser, SSGA FM, also serves as investment adviser to each\nseries of SPDR Index Shares Funds and SSGA Active Trust. Nonetheless, the Trust takes the position that it\nis not under common control with other trusts because the power residing in the respective boards and\nofficers arises as the result of an official position with the respective trusts. Additionally, see the\n\u201cControl Persons and Principal Holders of Securities\u201d section of the Statement of Additional Information for\na list of shareholders who own more than 5% of a specific fund\u2019s outstanding shares and such information is\nincorporated by reference to this Item. Item 30. Indemnification Pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Registrant\u2019s\nAmended and Restated Declaration of Trust and under Section 4.9 of the Registrant\u2019s By-Laws, the Trust will\nindemnify any person who is, or has been, a Trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Trust against all\nexpenses reasonably incurred or paid by him/her in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding in\nwhich he/she becomes involved as a party or otherwise by virtue of his/her being or having been a Trustee,\nofficer, employee or agent and against amounts paid or incurred by him/her in the settlement thereof, if\nhe/she acted in good faith and in a manner he/she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best\ninterests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to\nbelieve his/her conduct was unlawful. In addition, indemnification is permitted only if it is determined\nthat the actions in question did not render him/her liable by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence in the performance of his/her duties or by reason of reckless disregard of his/her\nobligations and duties to the Registrant. The Registrant may also advance money for litigation expenses\nprovided that Trustees, officers, employees and/or agents give their undertakings to repay the Registrant\nunless their conduct is later determined to permit indemnification. Pursuant to Section 5.2 of the\nRegistrant\u2019s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, no Trustee, officer, employee or agent of the\nRegistrant shall be liable for any action or failure to act, except in the case of willful misfeasance, bad\nfaith or gross negligence or reckless disregard of duties to the Registrant. Pursuant to paragraph 9 of the\nRegistrant\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser shall not be liable for any action or failure to\nact, except in the case of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence or reckless disregard of\nduties to the Registrant. Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of 1933\n(the \u201cAct\u201d) may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to\nthe provisions of Rule 484 under the Act, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion\nof the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore,\nunenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the\npayment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the\nRegistrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,\nofficer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will,\nunless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court\nof appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as\nexpressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The Registrant hereby\nundertakes that it will apply the indemnification provision of its By-Laws in a manner consistent with\nRelease 11330 of the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), so long as\nthe interpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i) thereunder remains in effect. The Registrant maintains\ninsurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Registrant, or\nwho is or was serving at the request of the Registrant as a trustee, director, officer, employee or agent of\nanother trust or corporation, against any liability asserted against him/her and incurred by him/her or\narising out of his/her position. However, in no event will the Registrant maintain insurance to indemnify\nany such person for any act for which the Registrant itself is not permitted to indemnify him/her.
