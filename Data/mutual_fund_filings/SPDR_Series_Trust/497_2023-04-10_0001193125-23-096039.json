  "text": "SPDR Series Trust\n\nSPDR S&P 600 Small Cap ETF\n\nOne Iron Street\n\nBoston,\nMassachusetts 02210\n\nApril 10, 2023\n\nDear Shareholder:\n\nEnclosed is important information concerning\nyour investment in the SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap\nETF, a series of SPDR Series Trust (the\n\u0093Trust\u0094).\n\nThe Board of Trustees of the Trust (the\n\u0093Board\u0094) has approved a Plan of Reorganization\nthat would provide for the reorganization of\nthe SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap ETF (the \u0093Acquired\nFund\u0094) into and with the SPDR Portfolio S&P\n600 Small Cap ETF (the \u0093Surviving\nFund,\u0094 and, together with the Acquired Fund,\nthe \u0093Funds\u0094), each a separate series of the\nTrust (the \u0093Reorganization\u0094). Each Fund is an\nindex fund that seeks to track, before fees\nand expenses, the performance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index. The Funds\u0092 investment\nobjectives, strategies and risks are the same,\nand the Funds are managed by the same\ninvestment adviser, SSGA Funds Management,\nInc. (\u0093SSGA FM\u0094). SSGA FM believes that\nshareholders of the\nAcquired Fund and the Surviving Fund would\nbenefit from the Reorganization. In\nparticular, Acquired Fund shareholders would\nbenefit from the Surviving Fund\u0092s lower\ncontractual management fee and lower total\noperating expenses before voluntary\nwaivers. SSGA FM currently voluntarily waives\na portion of the management fee it receives\nfrom the Acquired Fund to maintain the\nAcquired Fund\u0092s total annual operating\nexpenses at a level equal to that of the\nSurviving Fund; however, SSGA FM\nmay, in its sole discretion, discontinue this\nvoluntary waiver at any time. In addition, the\nReorganization will further increase the size\nof the Surviving Fund, which may lead to\nadditional secondary market liquidity and\npotentially lowering of\nbid/ask spreads. The Board, based upon factors\nand determinations discussed in the enclosed\ninformation statement and prospectus, has\ndetermined (i) that it is in the best\ninterests of the Acquired Fund, the Surviving\nFund and their respective\nshareholders to reorganize the Acquired Fund\ninto and with the Surviving Fund, and (ii)\nthat the Reorganization would not dilute the\ninterests of either Fund\u0092s shareholders.\n\nThe enclosed combined information statement\nand prospectus contains information about the\nReorganization. As a result of the\nReorganization, you will receive\na number of shares of beneficial interest of\nthe Surviving Fund and cash in lieu of any\nfractional shares of the Surviving Fund with\nan aggregate value equal to the current net\nasset value of your shares of the Acquired\nFund, as of the closing date\nof the Reorganization, and you will become a\nshareholder of the Surviving Fund.\n\nThe Reorganization will not require any\nshareholder action. In accordance with the\nTrust\u0092s Agreement and Declaration of Trust and\napplicable Massachusetts state and U.S.\nfederal law (including Rule 17a-8 under the\nInvestment\nCompany Act of 1940), the Reorganization may\nbe effected without the approval of\nshareholders of either Fund. Prior to the\nReorganization, you may purchase and sell\nshares of the Acquired Fund as usual in\naccordance with the procedures described in\nthe Fund\u0092s Prospectus dated October 31, 2022,\nas may be supplemented from time to time.\nAfter the close of business on or about June\n9, 2023, the Acquired Fund will transfer all\nof its assets and liabilities to the Surviving\nFund, and\nyour shares in the Acquired Fund will be\nautomatically exchanged for shares of the\nSurviving Fund and cash in lieu of any\nfractional shares of the Surviving Fund. The\nReorganization generally is not expected to\nresult in the recognition of gain or\nloss upon the exchange of your shares in\nconnection with this transaction (except with\nrespect to cash received in lieu of any\nfractional shares).\n\nIf you\nhave any questions or need additional\ninformation, please call 1-866-787-2257.\n               \n  Sincerely,   \n  David Urman  \n  David Urman  \n  Secretary    \n               \nCOMBINED INFORMATION STATEMENT AND PROSPECTUS\n\nApril 10, 2023\n\nSPDR SERIES TRUST\n\nOne Iron Street\n\nBoston, Massachusetts 02210\n                                              \n  SPDR S&P 600 Small                          \n  Cap ETF,              SPDR Portfolio S&P    \n  a series of SPDR      600 Small Cap ETF,    \n  Series Trust One      a series of SPDR      \n  Iron Street           Series Trust One      \n  Boston,               Iron Street Boston,   \n  Massachusetts         Massachusetts 02210   \n  02210                 (617) 664-1465        \n  (617) 664-1465                              \n                                              \nThis combined information statement and\nprospectus (the \u0093Information\nStatement/Prospectus\u0094) is being furnished to\nyou because you are a shareholder\nof the SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap ETF (the\n\u0093Acquired Fund\u0094), a series of SPDR Series\nTrust (the \u0093Trust\u0094). As provided in a Plan of\nReorganization (the \u0093Plan\u0094), the Acquired Fund\nwill be reorganized into and with another\nseries of the Trust, the SPDR Portfolio S&P\n600 Small Cap ETF (the \u0093Surviving Fund,\u0094 and,\ntogether with the Acquired Fund, the \u0093Funds\u0094).\nIn exchange for your shares of the Acquired\nFund, you will receive a number of shares of\nbeneficial interest of the Surviving Fund and\ncash in lieu of any fractional shares of the\nSurviving Fund with an aggregate value equal\nto the current net asset value (\u0093NAV\u0094) of your\nAcquired Fund shares, as of the closing date\nof the\nreorganization (the \u0093Reorganization\u0094). As a\nresult, at the conclusion of the\nReorganization, you will become a shareholder\nof the Surviving Fund.\n\nThe Trust\u0092s Board of Trustees (the \u0093Board\u0094)\nhas determined that the Reorganization is in\nthe best interests of each Fund and its\nshareholders,\nand that the interests of each Fund\u0092s\nshareholders will not be diluted as a result\nof the Reorganization. For federal income tax\npurposes, the Reorganization generally is not\nexpected to result in the recognition of\nincome, gain or loss by the\nAcquired Fund or its shareholders (except with\nrespect to cash received in lieu of any\nfractional shares).\n\nThe Acquired Fund and the Surviving Fund are\neach a series of the Trust, a Massachusetts\nbusiness trust registered with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the \u0093SEC\u0094) as an\nopen-end management investment company. SSGA\nFunds Management, Inc.\n(the \u0093Adviser\u0094 or \u0093SSGA FM\u0094) serves as\ninvestment adviser to both Funds, and the\nFunds have the same Trustees and officers and\nthe same distributor, auditor, and other\nservice providers.\n\nEach Fund is an index fund that seeks to\ntrack, before fees and expenses, the\nperformance of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. The\nFunds\u0092 investment\nobjectives, strategies, risks, and fundamental\nand non-fundamental policies are the same.

A form of\nthe Plan pursuant to which the Reorganization\nwill be conducted is attached to this\nInformation Statement/Prospectus as Appendix\nA.\n\nOverview.Each Fund is an index fund that seeks\nto track, before fees and expenses, the\nperformance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index. The Funds\u0092 investment\nobjectives, strategies and risks are the same,\nand the Funds are managed by the same\ninvestment adviser, SSGA FM. Further, there is\nan approximate 100% overlap in securities held\nby the Funds. SSGA FM\nbelieves that shareholders of the Acquired\nFund and the Surviving Fund would benefit from\nthe Reorganization. In particular, Acquired\nFund shareholders would benefit from the\nSurviving Fund\u0092s lower contractual management\nfee and lower total\noperating expenses before voluntary waivers.\nSSGA FM currently voluntarily waives a portion\nof the management fee it receives from the\nAcquired Fund to maintain the Acquired Fund\u0092s\ntotal annual operating expenses at a level\nequal to that of the\nSurviving Fund; however, SSGA FM may, in its\nsole discretion, discontinue this voluntary\nwaiver at any time. In addition, the\nReorganization will further increase the size\nof the Surviving Fund, which may lead to\nadditional secondary market\nliquidity and potentially lowering of bid/ask\nspreads.\n\nThe Board has unanimously determined that the\nReorganization is in the best interests of\neach Fund\nand its shareholders, and that the interests\nof each Fund\u0092s shareholders will not be\ndiluted as a result of the Reorganization.\n\nThe Reorganization and Plan of\nReorganization.The Board, including a majority\nof the Trustees who are not \u0093interested\npersons\u0094 (as defined in the Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as amended (the \u00931940\nAct\u0094)) of the Trust (the \u0093Independent\nTrustees\u0094), has unanimously approved the\nReorganization of the Acquired Fund with and\ninto the Surviving Fund. Under the Plan, on\nthe date of the Reorganization (the \u0093Closing\nDate\u0094), the\nAcquired Fund will transfer all of its assets\nto the Surviving Fund solely in exchange for\n(i) the Surviving Fund\u0092s assumption of all of\nthe liabilities of the Acquired Fund, and (ii)\nshares of beneficial interest of the Surviving\nFund and cash in lieu of fractional Surviving\nFund shares with an aggregate value equal to\nthe value of the net assets of the Acquired\nFund. Immediately thereafter, the Acquired\nFund will distribute these Surviving Fund\nshares and cash in lieu of\nany fractional shares to the Acquired Fund\nshareholders of record at the Closing Date in\nconnection with the liquidation and\ntermination of the Acquired Fund. The\naggregate NAV of the Surviving Fund shares and\nthe value of the cash in lieu of any\nfractional shares of the Surviving Fund\nreceived in the Reorganization by an Acquired\nFund shareholder will equal the aggregate NAV\nof the Acquired Fund shares held by the\nAcquired Fund shareholder immediately prior to\nthe Reorganization.\n\nPrior to the Reorganization, the Acquired Fund\nmay dispose of securities to better align the\nportfolios of the two Funds. Because the\nFunds\u0092 investment\nobjectives and strategies are the same, any\nsuch disposition of securities is not expected\nto be material or significant and in all\nevents will be consistent with the expectation\nthat the Reorganization will constitute a\n\u0093reorganization\u0094\nwithin the meaning of Section 368(a) of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n\u0093Code\u0094). The Acquired Fund may incur expenses\nassociated with such transactions, which are\nnot anticipated to be significant. The\nAcquired Fund\nmay also stop accepting new investments and\npurchasing portfolio securities at some time\nprior to the Closing Date in order to\nfacilitate the transfer of its portfolio\nsecurities to the Surviving Fund as part of\nthe Reorganization. As soon as\npracticable after the distribution and\nliquidation of the Acquired Fund described\nabove, the Acquired Fund will take steps to\nwind up its affairs.\n\nThe\nimplementation of the Reorganization is\nsubject to a number of conditions set forth in\nthe Plan, including the receipt of an opinion\nfrom counsel regarding the U.S. federal income\ntax consequences of the Reorganization\ndescribed in greater detail\nbelow. All expenses that are solely and\ndirectly related to the Reorganization will be\npaid by the Acquired Fund and borne by its\nshareholders. The Adviser estimates that these\ncosts will be approximately $95,000.\n\n5\n\nFederal Income Tax Consequences.The Trust\nbelieves that\nthe Reorganization will constitute a\n\u0093reorganization\u0094 within the meaning of Section\n368(a) of the Code for federal income tax\npurposes. As a condition to the closing of the\nReorganization, the Acquired Fund and the\nSurviving Fund will\nreceive an opinion of counsel to such effect.\nIn general, if the Reorganization so\nqualifies, no gain or loss will be recognized\nby the Acquired Fund or the Surviving Fund as\na direct result of the Reorganization and no\ngain or loss will be\nrecognized by the shareholders of the Acquired\nFund upon the exchange of their shares of the\nAcquired Fund for Surviving Fund shares\n(except with respect to cash received in lieu\nof any fractional shares). The aggregate tax\nbasis of the shares of\nthe Surviving Fund received by the Acquired\nFund shareholders will generally have the same\ntax basis as their shares in the Acquired Fund\nimmediately before the transfer of the assets,\nincreased by the amount of gain (or decreased\nby the amount of\nloss), if any, recognized by the Surviving\nFund upon the transfer, and decreased by the\namount of any such basis allocable to\nfractional shares of the Surviving Fund, which\nwill be treated as redeemed for cash. Prior to\nthe Reorganization, the\nAcquired Fund will distribute any previously\nundistributed net investment income and net\nrealized capital gains (after reduction for\nany capital loss carryforwards), which\ndistribution will be taxable to shareholders.\nCertain tax attributes of the\nAcquired Fund may carry over to the Surviving\nFund, including the ability of the Surviving\nFund to utilize the Acquired Fund\u0092s capital\nloss carryforwards, if any. See the section\nentitled \u0093Information about the\nReorganization\u0097Federal\nIncome Tax Consequences.\u0094\n\nComparison of the Acquired Fund and the\nSurviving Fund.This section\nis intended to help you compare the investment\nobjectives, policies, limitations, and risks\nof the Funds. Information contained in this\nInformation Statement/Prospectus is qualified\nby the more complete information set forth in\nthe Funds\u0092\nProspectus dated October 31, 2022, as may be\nsupplemented from time to time.\n\nInvestment Objectives and Strategies.The\nFunds\u0092 investment objectives and strategies\nare the same. The Acquired Fund and the\nSurviving Fund are exchange-traded funds that\nseek to provide investment results that,\nbefore fees and expenses, correspond\ngenerally to the total return performance of\nan index that tracks the performance of small\ncapitalization exchange traded U.S. equity\nsecurities.\n\nEach\nFund seeks to achieve its investment objective\nby tracking the S&P SmallCap 600 Index (the\n\u0093Index\u0094). Under normal market conditions, each\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities\ncomprising the Index. SSGA FM, the investment\nadviser to each Fund, either may invest a\nFund\u0092s assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest a Fund\u0092s assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by SSGA FM to be in the\nbest interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Each Fund is classified as\n\u0093diversified\u0094 under the Investment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, each Fund may become \u0093non-\ndiversified\u0094 solely as a result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one\nor more component securities). When a Fund is\nnon-diversified, it may invest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its assets in a limited\nnumber of issuers. Futures contracts (a type\nof derivative instrument) may be used by the\nFund in seeking performance that\ncorresponds to the Index and in managing cash\nflows. In seeking to track the Index, each\nFund\u0092s assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to\nthe extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries. As of December 30, 2022,\na significant portion of each Fund comprised\ncompanies in the industrial and financial\nsectors, although this may change from time to\ntime.\n\nInvestment Policies.The Funds have identical\nfundamental and\nnon-fundamental investment policies.\n\nPrincipal Risks.The Funds\nare subject to the same risks, each of which\nis described below.\n\n6\n\nAs with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund shares\nwill\nchange in value, and you could lose money by\ninvesting in the Fund. An investment in the\nFund is not insured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any\nother government agency.\n\nMarket Risk: The Fund\u0092s investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe\nrisks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\ninflation, changes in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural\ndisasters, the spread of infectious illness or\nother public health issues, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments.\n\nEquity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up\nor down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The value of a security may\ndecline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may\ndecline due to general industry or market\nconditions that are not specifically related\nto a particular company. In\naddition, equity markets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause stock prices to fall\nover short or extended periods of time.\n\nSmall-Capitalization Securities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-capitalization companies\nmay be more volatile and may involve more risk\nthan the securities of larger companies. These\ncompanies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets or financial resources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of larger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may\nhave been recently organized and may have\nlittle or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of smaller companies may trade less\nfrequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. Some securities of\nsmaller issuers may be illiquid\nor may be restricted as to resale, and their\nvalues may have significant volatility. The\nFund may be unable to liquidate its positions\nin such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund\u0092s\nobligations. Returns on\ninvestments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\nreturns on investments in securities of larger\ncompanies.\n\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund shares may be bought and\nsold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund shares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from the Fund\u0092s daily net\nasset value per share and there may be times\nwhen the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines.\n\nFinancial Sector Risk: Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which may limit both\nthe amounts\nand types of loans and other financial\ncommitments they can make, the interest rates\nand fees they can charge, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and the\namount of capital they must maintain.\nProfitability is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition.\nIn addition, deterioration of the credit\nmarkets generally may cause an adverse impact\nin a broad range of\nmarkets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally,\nthereby affecting a wide range of financial\ninstitutions and markets. Certain events in\nthe financial sector may cause an unusually\nhigh degree of volatility in\nthe financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services\ncompanies to incur large losses. Securities of\nfinancial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the\nissuance of debt or equity securities), or\ncease operations. Credit losses resulting from\nfinancial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with\n\n7\n\ninvestment activities can negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance companies may be subject\nto severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage\nfinance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to\nthe value of real estate.\n\nFutures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a\nstandardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract.\nTransactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will\nresult in a much greater loss than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may\nnot be able to close out the futures contract\nat a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an\nexchange will exist for any\nparticular futures contract. In the event no\nsuch market exists, it might not be possible\nto effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to\nthe futures contract. There is also a risk of\nimperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures\ncontract and movements in the price of the\nunderlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to\nmake timely settlement payments, return the\nFund\u0092s margin, or\notherwise honor its obligations.\n\nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy,\nattempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of\nthe current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising\nthe Index. This differs from an actively-\nmanaged fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund\u0092s performance may be less\nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed\nusing an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will\naffect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index\nin accordance with its methodology may occur\nfrom time to time and\nmay not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the Fund\nand its shareholders. To the extent\ncircumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period\nof time, securities of companies that do not\nalign with the Index\u0092s objective and/or\ncriteria. When there are changes made to the\ncomponent securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by\nthe Fund and its shareholders. The Fund may\nrecognize gains as a result of rebalancing or\nreconstituting its securities\nholdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be\nrequired to distribute any such gains to its\nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income\ntax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance of\nthe Index (i.e., achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund\u0092s return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The\nFund incurs a number of operating expenses not\napplicable to the Index, and incurs costs in\nbuying and\nselling securities. In addition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund\nor reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track\nthe Index\nreturn by investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the\nFund\u0092s return and that of the Index.\n\nIndustrial Sector Risk: Industrial companies\nare affected by supply and demand both for\ntheir specific product or service and for\nindustrial sector products in general.\nGovernment regulation, world events, exchange\nrates and economic conditions, technological\ndevelopments and liabilities for environmental\ndamage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these companies. Aerospace and\ndefense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry\nrely, to a significant extent, on U.S.\nand foreign government demand for their\nproducts and services. Thus, the financial\ncondition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are\n\n8\n\nheavily influenced by governmental defense\nspending policies which are typically under\npressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and\nother) government budgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are\ncyclical and have occasional sharp price\nmovements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs.\n\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market,\nstressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to\nsell\na security at an advantageous time or price or\nat all. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. If the liquidity\nof the Fund\u0092s holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund shares, and could\nresult in the Fund shares being less liquid.\nIlliquidity of the Fund\u0092s holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the\nFund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a\ntimely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in\npurchasing and selling such investments, may\nbe unable to achieve its desired\nlevel of exposure to a certain market or\nsector.\n\nNon-DiversificationRisk:To the extent\nthe Fund becomes \u0093non-diversified,\u0094 the Fund\nmay hold a smaller number of portfolio\nsecurities than many other funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests in a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a decline\nin the market value of a particular security\nheld by the Fund may affect its value more\nthan if it invested in a larger number of\nissuers. The value of Fund shares may be more\nvolatile than the values of shares of more\ndiversified funds. The Fund\nmay become non-diversified for periods of time\nsolely as a result of tracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in weightings of one or more\ncomponent securities).\n\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest\na substantial portion of its assets within one\nor more economic sectors or industries,\nwhich may change from time to time. Greater\ninvestment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for\nvolatility and the risk that events negatively\naffecting such sectors or industries could\nreduce returns, potentially\ncausing the value of the Fund\u0092s shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly.\n\nValuation Risk:Some portfolio holdings,\npotentially a large portion of the Fund\u0092s\ninvestment portfolio, may be valued on the\nbasis of factors other than market quotations.\nThis may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can\nbe used to value a portfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from\nwhat would be produced using a different\nmethodology or if it had been priced\nusing market quotations. Portfolio holdings\nthat are valued using techniques other than\nmarket quotations, including \u0093fair valued\u0094\nsecurities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were used. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the\nvalue established for it at any time, and it\nis possible that the Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position\nis sold or closed out at a discount to the\nvaluation established by the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFees and Expenses.\nBoth Funds are parties to the same investment\nadvisory agreement with the Trust. As part of\nthat agreement with the Trust, the Adviser has\ncontractually agreed to pay all expenses of\neach Fund, except management fees, brokerage\nexpenses, taxes,\ninterest, fees and expenses of the Independent\nTrustees (including any Trustee\u0092s counsel\nfees), litigation expenses, acquired fund fees\nand expenses and other extraordinary expenses.\nPursuant to the investment advisory agreement,\nthe Acquired\nFund pays the Adviser a management fee of\n0.15% of the Acquired Fund\u0092s average daily net\nassets and the Surviving Fund pays the Adviser\na management fee of 0.05% of the Surviving\nFund\u0092s average daily net assets.\n\nWith respect to the Acquired Fund, the Adviser\nhas voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of\nits management fee so that the total annual\nfund operating\nexpenses of the Acquired Fund do not exceed\n0.05% of its average daily net assets. The\nAdviser may, in its sole discretion,\ndiscontinue this voluntary waiver at any time\nwithout any prior notice.\n\n9\n\nFees and Expenses of the Funds\n\nThe table below describes the fees and\nexpenses that you may pay if you buy, hold and\nsell shares of the Funds for the fiscal year\nended June 30, 2022, as\nwell pro forma fees and expenses of the\nSurviving Fund on a combined basis after\ngiving effect to the Reorganization. You may\npay other fees, such as brokerage commissions\nand other fees to financial intermediaries,\nwhich are not reflected in the\ntable and Example below. The pro forma fees\nand expenses of the Surviving Fund on a\ncombined basis after giving effect to the\nReorganization will not differ from the\nSurviving Fund\u0092s current fees and expenses.\n                                              \n           Acqu\u2026       Survi\u2026         Pro     \n            Fund         Fund       Forma     \n                                    Comb\u2026     \n  Shar\u2026                                       \n  Fees                                        \n  (fees                                       \n  paid      None         None        None     \n  dire\u2026                                       \n  from                                        \n  your                                        \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Annu\u2026                                       \n  Fund                                        \n  Oper\u2026                                       \n  Expe\u2026                                       \n  (exp\u2026                                       \n  that                                        \n  you                                         \n  pay                                         \n  each                                        \n  year                                        \n  as a                                        \n  perc\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  the                                         \n  value                                       \n  of                                          \n  your                                        \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Mana\u2026     0.15  %      0.05  %     0.05  %  \n  Fees                                        \n  Dist\u2026                                       \n  and/\u2026                                       \n  Serv\u2026     None         None        None     \n  (12b\u2026                                       \n  Fees                                        \n  Other     0.00  %      0.00  %     0.00  %  \n  Expe\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  Annu\u2026                                       \n  Fund      0.15  %      0.05  %     0.05  %  \n  Oper\u2026                                       \n  Expe\u2026                                       \n                                              \nExample\n\nThis Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\ninvesting in the relevant Fund with the cost\nof investing in other funds.

The following bar charts and\ntables provide an indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Funds by showing changes in\neach Fund\u0092s performance from year to year and\nby showing how each Fund\u0092s average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with\nthe average annual returns of the Index and of\na\nrelevant broad-based securities index. A\nFund\u0092s past performance (before and after\ntaxes) is not necessarily an indication of how\nthe Fund will perform in the future. Updated\nperformance information is available by\ncalling 1-866-787-2257 or visiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.com/spdrs.\n\nAs noted below, the Surviving Fund began\ntracking the S&P SmallCap 600 Index on January\n24, 2020. Prior to January 24, 2020, the\nSurviving Fund\ntracked indexes different than the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index. During the period since\nJanuary 24, 2020, the performance of the Funds\nhas been substantially similar. In particular,\nfor the three-year period ended January 31,\n2023, the\nperformance of the Surviving Fund, the\nAcquired Fund, and the Index was 10.51%,\n10.52%, and 10.53%, respectively.\n\n10\n\nPerformance Information\n\nSurviving Fund\n\nThe performance information shown below is\nbased on a calendar year.\n\nAverage Annual Total Return\n\n(for periods ended 12/31/22)\n\nThe after-tax returns presented in the table\nbelow are calculated using highest historical\nindividual federal marginal income tax rates\nand do not reflect the impact of state and\nlocal taxes. Your actual after-tax returns\nwill depend on your specific tax situation and\nmay differ from those shown below. After-tax\nreturns are not relevant to investors who hold\nshares of the\nSurviving Fund through tax-advantaged\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before\ntaxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a\nshareholder from realizing a capital loss on a\nsale of shares of the Surviving Fund.\nEffective November 16, 2017, the Surviving\nFund\u0092s benchmark index changed from the\nRussell 2000 Index to the SSGA Small Cap\nIndex. Effective\nJanuary 24, 2020, the Surviving Fund\u0092s\nbenchmark index changed from the SSGA Small\nCap Index to the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. Each\nbenchmark index change was consistent with a\nchange in the Fund\u0092s principal investment\nstrategy to track the performance of a new\nindex. Performance of the Surviving Fund prior\nto January 24, 2020, is therefore based on the\nSurviving Fund\u0092s investment strategy to track\nthe applicable prior indexes and may have\nbeen different had the Fund tracked the\ncurrent index.\n                                              \n  Surv\u2026       One        Five       Since     \n  Fund       Year       Years       Ince\u2026     \n                                    (7/8\u2026     \n  Retu\u2026                                       \n  Befo\u2026    -16.11  %     5.76  %     8.45  %  \n  Taxes                                       \n  Retu\u2026                                       \n  After                                       \n  Taxes    -16.58  %     5.26  %     7.85  %  \n  on                                          \n  Dist\u2026                                       \n  Retu\u2026                                       \n  After                                       \n  Taxes                                       \n  on                                          \n  Dist\u2026     -9.54  %     4.34  %     6.62  %  \n  and                                         \n  Sale                                        \n  of                                          \n  Fund                                        \n  Shar\u2026                                       \n  S&P                                         \n  Smal\u2026                                       \n  600                                         \n  Inde\u2026                                       \n  Small                                       \n  Cap                                         \n  Inde\u2026                                       \n  2000                                        \n  Inde\u2026    -16.10  %     5.81  %     8.46  %  \n  (ref\u2026                                       \n  no                                          \n  dedu\u2026                                       \n  for                                         \n  fees,                                       \n  expe\u2026                                       \n  or                                          \n  taxe\u2026                                       \n  S&P                                         \n  500                                         \n  Index                                       \n  (ref\u2026                                       \n  no                                          \n  dedu\u2026    -18.11  %     9.42  %    11.56  %  \n  for                                         \n  fees,                                       \n  expe\u2026                                       \n  or                                          \n  taxe\u2026                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the S&P  \n     SmallCap 600 Index for the period        \n     January\u00a024, 2020 to                      \n     December\u00a031, 2022, the SSGA Small Cap    \n     Index for the period from November\u00a016,   \n     2017 to January\u00a023, 2020, and the        \n     Russell 2000 Index for periods prior to  \n  1  November\u00a016, 2017.                       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n11\n\nAcquired Fund\n\nThe performance information shown below is\nbased on a calendar year.\n\nAverage Annual Total Return\n\n(for periods ended 12/31/22)\n\nThe after-tax returns presented in the table\nbelow are calculated using highest historical\nindividual federal marginal income tax rates\nand do not reflect the impact of state and\nlocal taxes.

The Funds\u0092 procedures for\ncalculating NAV are\nidentical. NAV per share for each Fund is\ncomputed by dividing the value of the net\nassets of the Fund (i.e., the value of its\ntotal assets less total liabilities) by the\ntotal number of shares outstanding. Expenses\nand fees, including the\nmanagement fees, are accrued daily and taken\ninto account for purposes of determining NAV.\nThe NAV of each Fund is calculated by State\nStreet Bank and Trust Company and determined\nonce daily as of the close of the regular\ntrading session on the NYSE\n(ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on each\nday that such exchange is open. When\ncalculating NAV, each Fund will value the\nportfolio securities and assets of the Fund\nfor which market quotations are readily\navailable at the current market price of\nthose securities and assets. If market prices\nfor certain securities or instruments are not\nreadily available or the Adviser thinks that\nthey are unreliable, the Adviser\u0092s Oversight\nCommittee prices those securities and\ninstruments at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith using\nmethods approved by the Board of Trustees.\n\n14\n\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares. The Funds\u0092\nprocedures for the\npurchase and sale of Fund shares are\nidentical. Each Fund will issue or redeem\nshares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund shares\nknown as \u0093Creation Units.\u0094\nCreation Unit transactions are conducted in\nexchange for the deposit or delivery of a\ndesignated portfolio of in-kind securities\nand/or cash.\n\nIndividual Fund shares may only be purchased\nand sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other\nalternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nshares trade at market prices rather than at\nNAV, Fund shares may trade at a price greater\nthan NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling\nFund shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund shares (ask) (the \u0093bid-ask spread\u0094).\nRecent information regarding each Fund\u0092s NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs.\n\nThe Funds do not impose any restrictions on\nthe frequency of purchases and redemptions;\nhowever, the Funds reserve the right\nto reject or limit purchases at any time as\ndescribed in the Fund\u0092s SAI. When considering\nthat no restriction or policy was necessary,\nthe Board evaluated the risks posed by market\ntiming activities, such as whether frequent\npurchases and\nredemptions would interfere with the efficient\nimplementation of a Fund\u0092s investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause a Fund\nto experience increased transaction costs. The\nBoard considered that, unlike traditional\nmutual funds, Fund shares\nare issued and redeemed only in large\nquantities of shares known as Creation Units,\navailable only from a Fund directly, and that\nmost trading in a Fund occurs on the NYSE\nArca, Inc. at prevailing market prices and\ndoes not involve the Fund\ndirectly. Given this structure, the Board\ndetermined that it is unlikely that (a) market\ntiming would be attempted by a Fund\u0092s\nshareholders or (b) any attempts to market\ntime a Fund by shareholders would result in\nnegative impact to\nthe Fund or its shareholders.\n\nDividends and Distributions. The Funds have\nidentical dividends and distribution\npolicies. Each Fund generally pays out\ndividends to shareholders quarterly. In\naddition, each Fund distributes its net\ncapital gains, if any, to shareholders at\nleast annually.\n\nTax Information. With respect to both Funds,\nFund distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income,\nqualified dividend income and/or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you.\n\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries. If you purchase a Fund\u0092s\nshares through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), the\nAdviser or its affiliates may pay the\nfinancial intermediary for certain activities\nrelated to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u0092s website for more information.\n\nFinancial Highlights. The fiscal year end of\nthe Acquired Fund and Surviving Fund is June\n30. The financial\nhighlights for the Acquired Fund and Surviving\nFund are included in Appendix B. The Surviving\nFund will be the accounting survivor following\nthe Reorganization.\n\nI NFORMATIONA BOUT THER EORGANIZATION\n\nThe following summary of the Plan of\nReorganization does not purport to be complete\nand is qualified in its entirety by reference\nto the form of Plan, a copy\nof which is attached as Appendix A and is\nincorporated herein by reference.\n\n15\n\nTerms of the Plan of Reorganization.The Plan\nprovides for\nthe Reorganization to occur on the Closing\nDate, which is expected to be on or about June\n9, 2023, but may occur on such other date as\nfixed in writing by an authorized officer of\nthe Funds. On the Closing Date, the Acquired\nFund will transfer\nall its assets to the Surviving Fund solely in\nexchange for (i) the Surviving Fund\u0092s\nassumption of all the liabilities of the\nAcquired Fund, and (ii) shares of beneficial\ninterest of the Surviving Fund and cash in\nlieu of fractional\nSurviving Fund shares with an aggregate value\nequal to the value of the net assets of the\nAcquired Fund. Immediately thereafter, the\nAcquired Fund will distribute these Surviving\nFund shares and cash in lieu of any fractional\nshares to the Acquired\nFund shareholders of record at the Closing\nDate in connection with the liquidation and\ntermination of the Acquired Fund. The\naggregate NAV of the Surviving Fund shares and\ncash in lieu of any fractional shares of the\nSurviving Fund received in the\nReorganization will equal the aggregate NAV of\nthe Acquired Fund shares held by the Acquired\nFund\u0092s shareholders immediately prior to the\nReorganization.\n\nThe number of Surviving Fund shares to be\nissued and amount of cash in lieu of any\nfractional Surviving Fund shares to be\ndistributed in exchange for the\nAcquired Fund\u0092s assets will be determined on a\nshareholder-by-shareholder basis by\nmultiplying the outstanding shares of the\nAcquired Fund in respect of each\nshareholder by the ratio computed by dividing\nthe NAV per share of the Acquired Fund by the\nNAV per share of the Surviving Fund, as of a\nvaluation time set forth in the Plan. In\ndetermining the value of the securities\ntransferred by the Acquired\nFund to the Surviving Fund, each security will\nbe priced in accordance with the Trust\u0092s\nBoard-approved pricing policies and\nprocedures.\n\nThe transfer\nof shareholder accounts from the Acquired Fund\nto the Surviving Fund will occur\nautomatically. It is not necessary for\nAcquired Fund shareholders to take any action\nto effect the transfer. Please do not attempt\nto make the transfer yourself. If you do so,\nyou may disrupt the management of the Funds\u0092\nportfolios.No sales charge or fee of any kind\nwill be assessed to Acquired Fund shareholders\nin connection with their receipt of shares of\nthe Surviving Fund in the Reorganization.\n\nAll expenses that are solely and directly\nrelated to the Reorganization, largely those\nfor legal, accounting and printing expenses,\nwill be paid by the\nAcquired Fund and borne by its shareholders.\n\nThe Plan contains customary covenants and\nconditions. The Plan provides that the\nconsummation of the\nReorganization is conditioned upon, among\nother things, the receipt by the Acquired Fund\nand the Surviving Fund of an opinion of\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP that the\nReorganization will be treated as a\n\u0093reorganization\u0094 within the\nmeaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and\ngenerally will not result in income, gain, or\nloss being recognized for federal income tax\npurposes by the Acquired Fund, the Acquired\nFund\u0092s shareholders, or the Surviving Fund.\n\nThe Plan may be terminated if, before the\nClosing Date, the Board determines that the\nReorganization is not in the best interests of\nthe shareholders of the\nAcquired Fund or the Surviving Fund,\nrespectively, or any governmental body shall\nhave issued an order, decree, or ruling having\nthe effect of permanently enjoining,\nrestraining or otherwise prohibiting the\nconsummation of the Plan.\n\nFollowing the Reorganization, the Adviser will\ncontinue to act as investment adviser to the\nSurviving Fund.\n\nDescription of the Securities to be Issued.\nThe Surviving Fund\u0092s shares issued and\ndelivered to the shareholders\nof the Acquired Fund pursuant to the\nReorganization will be validly issued, fully\npaid and non-assessable when issued.\n\nBoard Considerations Relating to the\nReorganization.The Board considered and\ndiscussed the\nReorganization at a meeting held on February\n22-23, 2023. In its review of the\nReorganization, the Board was assisted by\nlegal counsel, and the Trustees who are not\n\u0093interested persons\u0094 of the Trust,\nas defined in\n\n16\n\nthe 1940 Act, were also assisted by\nindependent legal counsel. The factors\nconsidered by the Board include, but are not\nlimited to, those listed below.\n                                              \n      The Funds\u0092 investment objectives,        \n      strategies, risks, and fundamental and  \n      non-fundamental investment policies     \n      are identical.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Each Fund is managed by the Adviser     \n      and is a party to the same investment   \n      advisory agreement with the Adviser.    \n                                              \n                                              \n      The Surviving Fund pays the Adviser a   \n      contractual management fee that is      \n      less than the contractual management    \n      fee                                     \n      paid to the Adviser by the Acquired     \n      Fund. Under the investment advisory     \n      agreement, the Adviser pays all         \n      expenses of each Fund, subject to       \n      certain exceptions.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      The Surviving Fund has lower total      \n      annual fund operating expenses, before  \n      waivers, than the Acquired Fund.        \n                                              \n                                              \n      With respect to the Acquired Fund, the  \n      Adviser currently voluntarily waives a  \n      portion of its management fee so        \n      that the total annual fund operating    \n      expenses of the Acquired Fund are the   \n      same as those of the Surviving Fund;    \n      however, the Adviser may, in its sole   \n      discretion, discontinue this voluntary  \n      waiver at any time without any prior    \n      notice.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      Each Fund tracks the same Index and,    \n      therefore, the Funds have               \n      substantially similar portfolio         \n      holdings.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      The historical performance of the       \n      Funds has been substantially similar    \n      during periods when the Funds tracked   \n      the                                     \n      same Index.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      The Surviving Fund is considerably      \n      larger than the Acquired Fund and       \n      offers greater secondary market         \n      liquidity.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      The Reorganization will further         \n      increase the size of the Surviving      \n      Fund, which may lead to additional      \n      secondary                               \n      market liquidity and potentially        \n      lowering of bid/ask spreads.            \n                                              \n                                              \n      Gain or loss generally is not expected  \n      to be recognized by shareholders for    \n      U.S. federal income tax purposes as a   \n      result of the Reorganization (except    \n      with respect to cash received in lieu   \n      of any fractional shares).              \n                                              \n                                              \n      The aggregate NAV of the Surviving      \n      Fund shares and the value of any cash   \n      in lieu of any fractional shares of     \n      the                                     \n      Surviving Fund that shareholders of     \n      the Acquired Fund will receive in the   \n      Reorganization will equal the           \n      aggregate NAV of the shares that        \n      shareholders of the Acquired Fund own   \n      immediately prior to the                \n      Reorganization, and that the interests  \n      of                                      \n      shareholders of the Acquired Fund and   \n      the Surviving Fund will not be diluted  \n      as a result of the Reorganization.      \n                                              \n                                              \n      All expenses that are solely and        \n      directly related to the Reorganization  \n      will be paid by the Acquired Fund and   \n      borne by its shareholders (estimated    \n      to be approximately $95,000). When      \n      considering that the Acquired Fund      \n      would pay for the expenses of the       \n      Reorganization, the Board noted the     \n      benefits of the Reorganization to the   \n      Acquired Fund and its                   \n      shareholders, including the Surviving   \n      Fund\u0092s lower contractual management fee  \n      and lower total annual fund operating   \n      expenses (before voluntary waivers).    \n                                              \nThe Board, including a majority of the\nIndependent Trustees, concluded that based\nupon the factors and determinations summarized\nabove, completion of the\nReorganization is advisable and in the best\ninterests of each Fund and its shareholders,\nand that the interests of each Fund\u0092s\nshareholders will not be diluted as a result\nof the Reorganization. The determinations were\nmade on the basis of the\nbusiness judgment of each Trustee after\nconsideration of all of the factors taken as a\nwhole, though individual members may have\nplaced different weight on various factors and\nassigned different degrees of materiality to\nvarious conclusions.\n\n17\n\nFederal Income Tax Consequences.The\nReorganization is\nconditioned upon the receipt by the Acquired\nFund and the Surviving Fund of an opinion from\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, counsel to the\nTrust, substantially to the effect that, for\nfederal income tax purposes:\n

In\naddition, no opinion will be expressed as to\nthe effect of the Reorganization on any\nAcquired Fund shareholder that is required\nto recognize unrealized gains and losses for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes under a mark-\nto-market system of accounting.\n\n18\n\nIn rendering such opinion, counsel shall rely\nupon, among other things, certain facts,\nassumptions and\nrepresentations of the Trust, made on behalf\nof the Acquired Fund and Surviving Fund. No\ntax ruling has been or will be received from\nthe Internal Revenue Service in connection\nwith the Reorganization. An opinion of counsel\nis not binding on the\nInternal Revenue Service or a court, and no\nassurance can be given that the Internal\nRevenue Service would not assert, or a court\nwould not sustain, a contrary position.\nShareholders of the Acquired Fund should\nconsult their tax advisers regarding\nthe federal, state and local tax treatment and\nimplications of the Reorganization in light of\ntheir individual circumstances.\n\nImmediately prior to the\nReorganization, the Acquired Fund will declare\nand pay a dividend, which, together with all\nprevious dividends, is intended to have the\neffect of distributing to the Acquired Fund\nshareholders all of the Acquired Fund\u0092s\ninvestment company\ntaxable income (computed without regard to any\ndeduction for dividends paid) for taxable\nyears ending on or prior to the Closing Date,\nall of its net income and all of its net\ncapital gain, if any, realized in taxable\nyears ending on or prior to the\nClosing Date (after reduction for any\navailable capital loss carryover).\n\nFederal income tax law permits a regulated\ninvestment company to carry forward\nindefinitely its net capital losses to offset\nits capital gains recognized in future years.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Funds had the\nfollowing unused\ncapital loss carryforwards:\n                                        \n  Fund                 Total            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Acquired Fund     $  (111,094,639  )  \n  Surviving Fund    $  (239,167,758  )  \n                                        \nAs of the Closing Date, each Fund may have net\nrealized capital gains or losses and may also\nhave net unrealized gains or\nlosses.\n\nThe Reorganization may result in a number of\ndifferent limitations on the combined Fund\u0092s\nability, following the Reorganization, to use\nrealized and unrealized losses of the Acquired\nFund and the Surviving Fund. In the taxable\nyear of the Surviving Fund in which the\nReorganization occurs, the Surviving Fund will\nbe able to use capital loss carryforwards of\nthe Acquired Fund\n(including from the Acquired Fund\u0092s short\ntaxable year ending on the Closing Date),\nsubject to the additional limitations\ndescribed below, to offset only a prorated\nportion of the Surviving Fund\u0092s capital gains\nfor such taxable year, based\non the number of days remaining after the\nClosing Date in such taxable year.\n\nBecause shareholders of the Acquired Fund are\nexpected to own less than 50%\nof the Surviving Fund immediately after the\nReorganization, the Reorganization is expected\nto result in limitations on the combined\nFund\u0092s ability, following the Reorganization,\nto use any capital loss carryforwards of the\nAcquired Fund\n(including carryforwards generated in the tax\nyear of the Acquired Fund ending on the date\nof the Reorganization) and potentially on the\ncombined Fund\u0092s ability to use unrealized\ncapital losses inherent in the tax basis of\nthe assets of the\nAcquired Fund acquired in the Reorganization.\nThose limitations are imposed on an annual\nbasis. Capital losses in excess of this\nlimitation may be carried forward\nindefinitely, subject to any other applicable\nlimitations. The annual limitation on\nthe use of those carryforwards for periods\nfollowing the Reorganization generally will\nequal the product of the net asset value of\nthe Acquired Fund immediately prior to the\nReorganization and the \u0093long-term\ntax-exempt rate,\u0094 as published by the Internal\nRevenue Service (\u0093IRS\u0094) and in effect at the\ntime of the Reorganization. This limitation\nmay be prorated in the taxable year of the\nSurviving Fund\nin which the Reorganization occurs based on\nthe number of days remaining after the Closing\nDate in such taxable year.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, the\nReorganization may result in limitations on\nthe Surviving Fund\u0092s ability, in the post-\nReorganization period, to use a portion of any\ncapital loss carryforward of the Surviving\nFund from years ended prior to the Closing\nDate and/or generated in\nits tax year that includes the Reorganization,\nand potentially on the Surviving Fund\u0092s\nability to use unrealized capital losses\ninherent in the tax basis of\n\n19\n\nits assets. Those limitations are imposed on\nan annual basis. Losses in excess of the\nlimitation may be carried forward, subject to\ngenerally applicable limitations. If\napplicable, the annual\nlimitation on the use of those carryforwards\nfor periods following the Reorganization\ngenerally will equal the product of the net\nasset value of the Surviving Fund and the\n\u0093long-term tax-exempt\nrate,\u0094 as published by the IRS.\n\nIf the Surviving Fund or the Acquired Fund has\na net unrealized gain inherent in its assets\nat the time of the\nReorganization, then, under certain\ncircumstances, the combined Fund may not\noffset that gain, to the extent realized\nwithin five years of the Reorganization, by a\ncarryforward of pre-Reorganization losses\n(other than a carryforward of pre-\nReorganization losses of the Fund with the net\nunrealized gain inherent in its assets at the\ntime of the Reorganization) or, in certain\ncases, by a net unrealized loss\ninherent at the time of the Reorganization in\nthe assets of the other Fund involved in the\nReorganization. This limitation will generally\napply if the Surviving Fund\u0092s or the Acquired\nFund\u0092s unrealized capital gains as of the date\nof the\nReorganization are greater than either\n$10,000,000 or 15% of the value of its assets,\nsubject to certain adjustments.\n\nAs a result of the Reorganization,\nlosses and loss carryforwards will benefit the\nshareholders of the combined Surviving Fund,\nrather than only the shareholders of the Fund\nthat incurred them. Even if a particular\nlimitation described above would not be\ntriggered solely by the\nReorganization, the limitation may be\ntriggered by the Reorganization and one or\nmore other transactions entered into by the\nAcquired Fund or Surviving Fund (including,\npotentially, another reorganization). By\nreason of the foregoing rules, taxable\nshareholders may pay more taxes, or pay taxes\nsooner, than they otherwise would have if the\nReorganization did not occur.\n\nSince the Reorganization is not\nexpected to close until the close of business\non June 9, 2023, the capital loss\ncarryforwards, realized and unrealized gains\nand losses, and the applicability of the\nlimitations described above may change\nsignificantly between now and the\ncompletion of the Reorganization. Further, the\nability of each Fund to use losses (even in\nthe absence of the Reorganization) also\ndepends on factors other than loss\nlimitations, such as the future realization of\ncapital gains.\n\nComparison of Shareholder Rights.There are no\nmaterial differences between the rights of\nshareholders of the\nAcquired Fund and the rights of shareholders\nof the Surviving Fund.\n\nA DDITIONALI NFORMATIONA BOUT THEA CQUIREDF\nUND AND THES URVIVINGF UND\n\nAdditional information about the Surviving\nFund and the Acquired Fund is incorporated by\nreference into this Information\nStatement/Prospectus from the\nProspectus for the Funds, dated October 31,\n2022, as may be supplemented from time to\ntime, forming a part of each Fund\u0092s\nRegistration Statement on Form N-1A (File Nos.\n333-57793 and 811-08839).

REORGANIZATION (the \u0093Plan\u0094) is\ndated as of this [] day of\n[], 2023, and has been adopted by SPDR Series\nTrust, a Massachusetts business trust (the\n\u0093Trust\u0094), to provide for the reorganization of\nthe Trust\u0092s SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap ETF (the\n\u0093Acquired Fund\u0094), with and into the Trust\u0092s\nSPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap ETF (the\n\u0093Surviving Fund\u0094 and, together with the\nAcquired Fund, the \u0093Funds\u0094).\n\nWHEREAS, the Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998\nand is an\nopen-end management investment company\nregistered under the Investment Company Act of\n1940, as amended (the \u00931940 Act\u0094);\n\nWHEREAS, each of the Acquired Fund and the\nSurviving Fund is a separate investment series\nof the Trust and the Acquired Fund owns\nsecurities\nin which the Surviving Fund is permitted to\ninvest;\n\nWHEREAS, each of the Acquired Fund and the\nSurviving Fund is authorized to issue\nshares of beneficial interest;\n\nWHEREAS, the Funds intend this Plan to be, and\nadopt it as, a \u0093plan of reorganization\u0094 within\nthe meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094),\nand the Treasury regulations thereunder; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Trustees of the Trust, including\na majority of Trustees that are not\n\u0093interested persons,\u0094 as such term is defined\nin\nSection 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of the Trust\nhave determined that the transactions\ncontemplated herein are in the best interests\nof each Fund and that the interests of each\nFund\u0092s existing shareholders will not be\ndiluted as a result;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, the Trust, on behalf of each\nFund, intends to enter into a series of\ntransactions pursuant to which: (i) the\nAcquired Fund will transfer all of its assets\nto the Surviving Fund solely in exchange for\n(a) the Surviving Fund\u0092s assumption of all of\nthe liabilities of the Acquired Fund, and (b)\nshares of beneficial interest of the Surviving\nFund\n(\u0093Surviving Fund Shares\u0094) and cash in lieu of\nfractional Surviving Fund Shares with such\ncash and shares having an aggregate value\nequal to the value of the net assets of the\nAcquired Fund being acquired, and (ii) the\nAcquired Fund\nwill subsequently distribute, on the Closing\nDate (as defined in Section 9 of this Plan),\nthe Surviving Fund Shares and cash in lieu of\nfractional Surviving Fund Shares to holders of\nshares of the Acquired Fund (\u0093Acquired Fund\nShares\u0094), in exchange for their Acquired Fund\nShares, in liquidation and termination of the\nAcquired Fund (collectively, the\n\u0093Reorganization\u0094), all upon the terms and\nconditions hereinafter set forth in this Plan.\n\n1. . At the Closing Date, the Acquired Fund\nshall assign, deliver, and otherwise transfer\nall of its assets and\ngood and marketable title thereto, and assign\nall its liabilities, irrespective of whether\nthey are set forth in the statement of assets\nand liabilities referred to in Section 2(a)\nbelow, to the Surviving Fund, free and clear\nof all liens,\nencumbrances and adverse claims except as\nprovided in this Plan, and the Surviving Fund\nshall acquire all assets, and shall assume all\nliabilities of the Acquired Fund, and the\nSurviving Fund shall deliver to the Acquired\nFund a number of Surviving\nFund Shares and cash in lieu of fractional\nSurviving Fund Shares that in the aggregate\nhave a combined total value equal to the value\nof the Acquired Fund Shares outstanding at the\nclose of business on the Closing Date, as\ndetermined in the manner\nset forth in Section 3 below. Shareholders of\nrecord of the Acquired Fund at the Closing\nDate shall be credited with Surviving Fund\nShares and, as necessary, cash in lieu of any\noutstanding fractional Surviving Fund Shares,\nin exchange for\ntheir Acquired Fund Shares, as determined in\nthe manner set forth\n\nA-i\n\nin Section 3 below. The assets and liabilities\nof the Acquired Fund shall be exclusively\nassigned to and assumed by the Surviving Fund.\nAll debts, liabilities, obligations and duties\nof the\nAcquired Fund, to the extent that they exist\nat or after the Closing Date, shall after the\nClosing Date attach to the Surviving Fund and\nmay be enforced against the Surviving Fund to\nthe same extent as if the same had been\nincurred by the Surviving\nFund.\n\n2. .\n\n(a) The assets of the Acquired Fund to be\nacquired by the Surviving Fund shall include,\nwithout limitation, all cash,\ncash equivalents, securities, and receivables\n(including interest and dividends receivable)\nas set forth in a statement of assets and\nliabilities to be prepared as of the Valuation\nTime (as defined in Section 5 of this Plan),\nas well as any\nclaims or rights of action or rights to\nregister shares under applicable securities\nlaws, any books or records of the Acquired\nFund and other property owned by the Acquired\nFund at the Closing Date.\n\n(b) In the event that the Acquired Fund holds\nany investments that the Surviving Fund may\nnot hold, the Acquired Fund\nwill dispose of such investments prior to the\nClosing Date. In addition, if it is determined\nthat the Acquired Fund and the Surviving Fund\nportfolios, when aggregated, would contain\ninvestments exceeding certain percentage\nlimitations imposed upon\nthe Surviving Fund with respect to such\ninvestments, the Acquired Fund will dispose of\na sufficient amount of such investments as may\nbe necessary to avoid violating such\nlimitations as of the Closing Date.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, nothing\nherein will require the Acquired Fund to\ndispose of any investments or securities if,\nin the reasonable judgment of the Acquired\nFund, such disposition would either violate\nthe Acquired Fund\u0092s fiduciary duty to its\nshareholders or adversely\naffect the treatment of the Reorganization as\na \u0093reorganization\u0094 within the meaning of\nSection 368(a) of the Code.\n\n3. .\n\n(a) The number of Surviving Fund Shares to be\nissued to, and the amount of cash in lieu of\nfractional Surviving Fund\nShares to be distributed to, the Acquired Fund\nby the Surviving Fund in exchange for the\nAcquired Fund\u0092s assets pursuant to Section 1\nhereof shall have an aggregate value equal to\nthe value of the outstanding Acquired Fund\nShares, with\nsuch value determined in accordance with\nSection 3(b). Each shareholder of record of\nthe Acquired Fund at the Closing Date shall be\ncredited with the whole number of full\nSurviving Fund Shares (rounding down)\ndetermined by dividing the\naggregate net asset value of the Acquired Fund\nShares held by such shareholder on the Closing\nDate by the net asset value of one Surviving\nFund Share, and, if applicable, cash in lieu\nof fractional shares.\n\n(b) The net asset value per share of each Fund\nshall be the net asset value per share\ncomputed as of Valuation Time (as\ndefined in Section 5 below), in accordance\nwith the pricing policies and procedures\nadopted by the Trust as described in the then\ncurrent prospectus and statement of additional\ninformation of the Funds under the Securities\nAct of 1933 (the\n\u00931933 Act\u0094).\n\n4. . The value of the assets of the Acquired\nFund shall be the value of such\nassets computed as of the Valuation Time. In\ndetermining the value of the securities\ntransferred by the Acquired Fund to the\nSurviving Fund, each security shall be priced\nin accordance with the pricing policies and\nprocedures adopted by the Board of\nTrustees of the Trust.\n\n5. . The valuation time shall be 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern Time, on June 9, 2023, or\nsuch earlier or later date and time as may be\ndetermined in writing by an authorized officer\nof the Funds (the \u0093Valuation Time\u0094).\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the\ncontrary, in the event that at the Valuation\nTime, (a) the New\nYork Stock Exchange shall be closed to trading\nor trading thereon shall be restricted, or\n\nA-ii\n\n(b) trading or the reporting of trading on\nsuch exchange or elsewhere shall be disrupted\nso that, in the judgment of the Trust,\naccurate appraisal of the value of the net\nassets of the Acquired\nFund is impracticable, the Valuation Time\nshall be postponed until the second business\nday after the day when trading shall have been\nfully resumed without restriction or\ndisruption, reporting shall have been restored\nand accurate appraisal of the\nvalue of the net assets of the Acquired Fund\nis practicable.\n\n6. . On the Closing Date, the Acquired Fund\nwill liquidate and the Surviving Fund Shares\nand cash in lieu of any fractional Surviving\nFund Shares received by the Acquired Fund will\nbe distributed to the shareholders of record\nof the Acquired\nFund as of the Closing Date in exchange for\ntheir Acquired Fund Shares and in complete\nliquidation of the Acquired Fund. Such\nliquidation and distribution will be\naccompanied by the establishment of an open\naccount on the share records of the\nSurviving Fund in the name of each shareholder\nof the Acquired Fund that represents the\nrespective number of Surviving Fund Shares and\namount of cash in lieu of any fractional\nSurviving Fund Shares due such shareholder.\nAll of the issued and\noutstanding shares of the Acquired Fund shall\nbe cancelled on the books of the Trust at the\nClosing Date and shall thereafter represent\nonly the right to receive Surviving Fund\nShares and cash in lieu of any fractional\nSurviving Fund Shares. The\nAcquired Fund\u0092s transfer books shall be closed\npermanently. The Trust also shall take any and\nall other steps as shall be necessary and\nproper to effect a complete termination of the\nAcquired Fund.\n\n7. .\n\n(a) The Surviving Fund and the Acquired Fund\neach will operate its business in the ordinary\ncourse between the date\nhereof and the Closing Date, it being\nunderstood that such ordinary course of\nbusiness will include distributions of net\ninvestment income and net realized capital\ngains, changes in portfolio securities,\nchanges in market value of portfolio\nsecurities, and net redemptions.\n\n(b) Subject to the provisions of this Plan,\nthe Trust will take, or cause to be\ntaken, all action, and do or cause to be done,\nall things reasonably necessary, proper or\nadvisable to consummate and make effective the\ntransactions contemplated by this Plan,\nincluding any actions required to be taken\nafter the Closing Date.\n\n(c) On or before the Closing Date, the\nAcquired Fund shall declare and pay a dividend\nor dividends which, together with all previous\nsuch\ndividends, shall have the effect of\ndistributing to its shareholders all of the\nAcquired Fund\u0092s investment company taxable\nincome (as defined in the Code) (computed\nwithout regard to any deduction for dividends\npaid), if any, plus the excess,\nif any, of its interest income excludible from\ngross income under Section 103(a) of the Code\nover its deductions disallowed under Sections\n265 and 171(a)(2) of the Code for all taxable\nperiods or years ending on or before the\nClosing Date\n(including the current taxable year, assuming\nsuch year ends on the Closing Date), and all\nof its net capital gain (as defined in the\nCode) (after reduction for any capital loss\ncarry forward), if any, that has accrued or\nbeen recognized,\nrespectively, through the Closing Date for all\napplicable periods or years ending on or\nbefore the Closing Date, such that the\nAcquired Fund will not have any unpaid tax\nliability under the Code.\n\n(d) For each applicable year or period of its\noperation ending prior to the Closing Date,\nthe Surviving Fund will have\ndistributed substantially all of (i) its\ninvestment company taxable income (as defined\nin the Code) (computed without regard to any\ndeduction for dividends paid), (ii) the\nexcess, if any, of its interest income\nexcludible from gross income\nunder Section 103(a) of the Code, if any, over\nits deductions disallowed under Sections 265\nand 171(a)(2) of the Code, and (iii) any net\ncapital gain (as defined in the Code) (after\nreduction for any capital loss carry forward),\nsuch that\nthe Surviving Fund will not have any unpaid\ntax liability under the Code for any such year\nor period.\n\nA-iii\n\n8. .

year, or (B) upon\nthe transfer of an asset regardless of\nwhether such transfer would otherwise be a\nnon-recognition transaction under the Code.\n\n(iii) No\ngain or loss will be recognized by the\nSurviving Fund upon the receipt of all the\nassets of the Acquired Fund solely in exchange\nfor Surviving Fund Shares and the assumption\nby the Surviving Fund of the liabilities of\nthe Acquired Fund as part of\nthe Reorganization.\n\n(iv) The tax basis in the hands of the\nSurviving Fund of each asset of the Acquired\nFund transferred from the\nAcquired Fund to the Surviving Fund in

Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay\neach year as a percentage of the value of\nyour investment):\n                                         \n  Management                      0.05%  \n  fees                                   \n  Distribution                    None   \n  and service (12b-1) fees               \n  Other                           0.00%  \n  expenses                               \n  Total                           0.05%  \n  annual Fund operating expenses         \n                                         \nExample: This Example is intended to help\nyou compare the cost of investing in the\nFund with the cost of investing in other\nfunds. The Example assumes that you invest\n$10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of\nyour Fund Shares at the end of those\nperiods. The Example also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                          \n  Year  Year  Year  Year  \n  1        3     5    10  \n  $5     $16   $28   $64  \n                          \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal\nyear, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was\n16% of the average value of its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal Investment Strategy In\nseeking to track the performance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that\nthe Fund is not required to purchase all of\nthe securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the\nFund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the\n\n1 of 6\n                                              \n  SPDR\u00aePortfolio                              \n   S&P 600 Small Cap ETF                      \n                                              \nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund\nin pursuing its                               \nobjective.\u00a0The Fund is classified as          \n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the Investment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended; however, the Fund may    \nbecome \u201cnon-diversified\u201d solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in          \nweightings of one or more component           \nsecurities). When the Fund is non-diversified,\nit may invest a relatively high percentage of \nits assets in a limited number of issuers.    \n                                              \nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund      \ngenerally invests                             \nsubstantially all, but at least 80%, of its   \ntotal assets in the securities comprising the \nIndex. In addition,\u00a0in seeking to track the   \nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity          \nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents                     \nor money market instruments, such as          \nrepurchase agreements and money market funds  \n(including money market funds advised by the  \nAdviser). In seeking to track the Index, the  \nFund's assets may be concentrated in an       \nindustry or group of industries, but          \nonly\u00a0to the extent that the Index concentrates\nin a particular industry or group of          \nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of      \nderivative instrument) may be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing                         \ncash flows.                                   \n                                              \nThe Index measures the performance of the     \nsmall-capitalization segment of the U.S.      \nequity market. The selection universe for the \nIndex includes all U.S. common equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American, NASDAQ \nGlobal Select Market, NASDAQ Select Market,   \nNASDAQ Capital Market,                        \nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX   \nwith unadjusted market capitalizations between\n$850 million and $3.7 billion and float-      \nadjusted market capitalizations of at least   \n$425 million at the time of inclusion. These  \ncapitalization ranges may be                  \nrevised by the Index Provider (as defined     \nbelow) at any time. To be included in the     \nIndex, a security (or issuer of a security, as\napplicable) should (i) have an annual dollar  \nvalue traded to float-adjusted market         \ncapitalization ratio of 1 or                  \ngreater; (ii) trade a minimum of 250,000      \nshares in each of the six months leading up to\nthe evaluation date; (iii) have a public float\nof at least 10%; and (iv) have positive       \naggregate earnings over the four most recent  \nquarters and for the most                     \nrecent quarter. In selecting securities for   \ninclusion in the Index, the Index Provider    \nalso considers sector balance by comparing the\nweight of each GICS (Global Industry          \nClassification Standard) sector in the Index  \nto its weight in the relevant                 \nmarket capitalization range of the S&P Total  \nMarket Index.                                 \n                                              \nThe Index is float-adjusted market            \ncapitalization weighted.                      \nIndex constituents are added and removed on an\nas-needed basis. The Index is rebalanced on a \nquarterly basis in March, June, September and \nDecember. As of August 31, 2022, a significant\nportion of the Fund comprised companies in the\nfinancial and                                 \nindustrial sectors, although this may change  \nfrom time to time. As of July 31, 2022, the   \nIndex comprised 601 stocks.                   \n                                              \nThe Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones       \nIndices                                       \nLLC\u00a0(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not      \naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The  \nIndex Provider determines the composition of  \nthe Index, relative weightings of the         \nsecurities in the Index and publishes         \ninformation regarding the                     \nmarket value of the Index.                    \n                                              \n  Principal Risks of Investing in             \n  the Fund                                    \n                                              \nAs with all investments, there are certain    \nrisks                                         \nof investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will    \nchange in value, and you could lose money by  \ninvesting in the Fund. An investment in the   \nFund is not insured or guaranteed by the      \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any  \nother government agency.                      \n                                              \nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are       \nsubject to changes in general economic        \nconditions, general market fluctuations and   \nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile   \nand prices of investments can change          \nsubstantially due to various factors          \nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,      \ninflation, changes in the actual or perceived \ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general      \nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the  \nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt    \nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or     \nglobal events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the     \nspread of infectious illness or other public  \nhealth issues, or other events could have a   \nsignificant impact on the Fund and its        \ninvestments.                                  \n                                              \nEquity Investing Risk: The market prices of   \nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up \nor down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.  \nThe value of a security may decline for a     \nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to \nthe issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not    \nspecifically related to a particular company. \nIn addition, equity markets tend to move in   \ncycles, which may cause stock prices to fall  \nover short or extended periods of time.       \n                                              \nSmall-Capitalization Securities Risk: The     \nsecurities of small-capitalization companies  \nmay be more volatile and may involve more risk\nthan the securities of larger companies. These\ncompanies may have limited product lines,     \nmarkets or financial resources, may lack the  \ncompetitive strength of larger companies, and \nmay depend on a few key employees. In         \naddition, these companies may have been       \nrecently organized and may have little or no  \ntrack record of success. The securities of    \nsmaller companies may trade less frequently   \nand in smaller volumes than more widely held  \nsecurities. Some securities of smaller issuers\nmay be illiquid or may be restricted as to    \nresale, and their values may have significant \nvolatility. The Fund may be unable to         \nliquidate its positions in such securities at \nany time, or at a favorable price, in order to\nmeet the Fund's obligations. Returns on       \ninvestments in securities of small-           \ncapitalization companies could trail the      \nreturns on investments in securities of larger\ncompanies.                                    \n                                              \n  State Street Global Advisors                \n                                              \n                    2 of 6                    \n                                              \n  SPDR\u00aePortfolio                              \n   S&P 600 Small Cap ETF                      \n                                              \nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts                                 \nRisk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund \nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket at market prices. The trading prices of\nFund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per     \nshare and there may be times when the market  \nprice of the shares is more than the net asset\nvalue per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or   \nperiods of steep market declines.             \n                                              \nFinancial Sector                              \nRisk: Financial services companies are subject\nto extensive governmental regulation, which   \nmay limit both the amounts and types of loans \nand other financial commitments they can make,\nthe interest rates and fees they can charge,  \nthe scope of their activities, the prices they\ncan charge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent  \non the availability and cost of capital funds \nand can fluctuate significantly when interest \nrates change or due to increased competition. \nIn addition, deterioration of the credit      \nmarkets generally may cause an adverse impact \nin a broad range of markets, including U.S.   \nand international credit and interbank money  \nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide   \nrange of financial institutions and markets.  \nCertain events in the financial sector may    \ncause an unusually high degree of volatility  \nin the financial markets, both domestic and   \nforeign, and cause certain financial services \ncompanies to incur large losses. Securities of\nfinancial services companies may experience a \ndramatic decline in value when such companies \nexperience substantial declines in the        \nvaluations of their assets, take action to    \nraise capital (such as the issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or cease operations.      \nCredit losses resulting from financial        \ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses\nassociated with investment activities can     \nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance       \ncompanies may be subject to severe price      \ncompetition. Adverse economic, business or    \npolitical developments could adversely affect \nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage    \nfinance or other lending or investing         \nactivities directly or indirectly connected to\nthe value of real estate.                     \n                                              \nFutures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a\nstandardized agreement that calls for the     \npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a     \nspecific price at a specific future time, or  \ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. \nTransactions in futures contracts can create  \ninvestment leverage and may have significant  \nvolatility. It is possible that a futures     \ncontract transaction will result in a much    \ngreater loss than the principal amount        \ninvested, and the Fund may not be able to     \nclose out the futures contract at a favorable \ntime or price. There is no assurance that a   \nliquid secondary market on an exchange will   \nexist for any particular futures contract. In \nthe event no such market exists, it might not \nbe possible to effect closing transactions,   \nand the Fund will be unable to terminate its  \nexposure to the futures contract. There is    \nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between  \nmovements in the prices of the futures        \ncontract and movements in the price of the    \nunderlying assets. The counterparty to a      \nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to\nmake timely settlement payments, return the   \nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its         \nobligations.                                  \n                                              \nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The    \nFund is managed with an indexing investment   \nstrategy, attempting to track the performance \nof an unmanaged index of securities,          \nregardless of the current or projected        \nperformance of the Index or of the actual     \nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs \nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a   \nresult, the Fund's performance may be less    \nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed    \nusing an active investment strategy. The      \nstructure and composition of the Index will   \naffect the performance, volatility, and risk  \nof the Index and, consequently, the           \nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or   \nthe construction of the Index in accordance   \nwith its methodology may occur from time to   \ntime and may not be identified and corrected  \nby the Index Provider for a period of time or \nat all, which may have an adverse impact on   \nthe Fund and its shareholders. To the extent  \ncircumstances evolve in between               \nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and   \nthe Fund may therefore hold for a period of   \ntime, securities of companies that do not     \nalign with the Index's objective and/or       \ncriteria. When there are changes made to the  \ncomponent securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its          \nportfolio, any transaction costs and market   \nexposure arising from such portfolio changes  \nwill be borne directly by the Fund and its    \nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as \na result of rebalancing or reconstituting its \nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the \nsecurities included in the Index. The Fund    \nalso may be required to distribute any such   \ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse    \nfederal income tax consequences. While the    \nAdviser seeks to track the performance of the \nIndex ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of       \ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The    \nFund incurs a number of operating expenses not\napplicable to the Index, and incurs costs in  \nbuying and selling securities. In addition,   \nthe Fund may not be fully invested at times,  \ngenerally as a result of cash flows into or   \nout of the Fund or reserves of cash held by   \nthe Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may \nattempt to track the Index return by investing\nin fewer than all of the securities in the    \nIndex, or in some securities not included in  \nthe Index, potentially increasing the risk of \ndivergence between the Fund's return and that \nof the Index.                                 \n                                              \nIndustrial Sector Risk: Industrial companies  \nare affected by supply and demand both for    \ntheir specific product or service and for     \nindustrial sector products in general.        \nGovernment regulation, world events, exchange \nrates and economic conditions, technological  \ndevelopments and liabilities for environmental\ndamage and general civil liabilities will     \nlikewise affect the performance of these      \ncompanies. Aerospace and defense companies, a \ncomponent of the industrial sector, can be    \nsignificantly affected by government spending \npolicies because companies involved in this   \nindustry rely, to a significant extent, on    \nU.S. and foreign government demand for their  \nproducts and services. Thus, the financial    \ncondition of, and investor interest in,       \naerospace and defense companies are heavily   \ninfluenced by governmental defense spending   \npolicies which are typically under pressure   \nfrom efforts to control the U.S.              \n                                              \n  State Street Global Advisors                \n                                              \n                    3 of 6                    \n                                              \n  SPDR\u00aePortfolio                              \n   S&P 600 Small Cap ETF                      \n                                              \n(and other) government budgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component of the                \nindustrial sector, are cyclical and have      \noccasional sharp price movements which may    \nresult from changes in the economy, fuel      \nprices, labor agreements and insurance costs. \n                                              \nLiquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market,       \nstressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to   \nsell a security at an advantageous time or    \nprice or at all. Illiquid investments may     \ntrade at a discount from comparable, more     \nliquid investments and may be subject to wide \nfluctuations in market value. If the liquidity\nof the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may   \nlead to differences between the market price  \nof Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares   \nbeing less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's  \nholdings may also limit the ability of the    \nFund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a  \ntimely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to   \nlimitations on investments in any illiquid    \ninvestments and/or the difficulty in          \npurchasing and selling such investments, may  \nbe unable to achieve its desired level of     \nexposure to a certain market or sector.       \n                                              \nNon-Diversification Risk: To the extent the   \nFund becomes \u201cnon-diversified,\u201d the Fund may  \nhold a smaller number of portfolio securities \nthan many other funds. To the extent the Fund \ninvests in a relatively small number of       \nissuers, a decline in the market value of a   \nparticular security held by the Fund may      \naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund   \nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome non-diversified for periods of time    \nsolely as a result of tracking the Index      \n(e.g., changes in weightings of one or more   \ncomponent securities).                        \n                                              \nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest\na substantial portion of its assets within one\nor more economic sectors or industries, which \nmay change from time to time. Greater         \ninvestment focus on one or more sectors or    \nindustries increases the potential for        \nvolatility and the risk that events negatively\naffecting such sectors or industries could    \nreduce returns, potentially causing the value \nof the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps     \nsignificantly.                                \n                                              \nValuation Risk: Some portfolio holdings,      \npotentially a large portion of the Fund's     \ninvestment portfolio, may be valued on the    \nbasis of factors other than market quotations.\nThis may occur more often in times of market  \nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are       \nmultiple methods that can be used to value a  \nportfolio holding when market quotations are  \nnot readily available. The value established  \nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time  \nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been     \npriced using market quotations. Portfolio     \nholdings that are valued using techniques     \nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair \nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater \nfluctuation in their valuations from one day  \nto the next than if market quotations were    \nused. In addition, there is no assurance that \nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio  \nposition for the value established for it at  \nany time, and it is possible that the Fund    \nwould incur a loss because a portfolio        \nposition is sold or closed out at a discount  \nto the valuation established by the Fund at   \nthat time.                                    \n                                              \n  State Street Global Advisors                \n                                              \n                    4 of 6                    \nSPDR \u00aePortfolio S&P 600\nSmall Cap ETF\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\nEffective November 16, 2017, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Russell 2000\nIndex to the SSGA Small Cap Index. Effective\nJanuary 24, 2020, the Fund's benchmark index\nchanged from the SSGA Small Cap Index to the\nS&P SmallCap 600 Index. Each benchmark index\nchange was consistent with a change in the\nFund's principal investment strategy to track\nthe performance of a new index. Performance of\nthe Fund prior to January 24, 2020 is\ntherefore based on the Fund's investment\nstrategy to track the applicable prior indexes\nand may have been different had the Fund\ntracked the current index.\n                                              \n                   One     Five    Since      \n                   Year    Years   Inception  \n                                   (7/8/13)   \n  Return           26.73%  12.72%  11.79%     \n  Before Taxes                                \n  Return                                      \n  After Taxes on   26.24%  12.19%  11.17%     \n  Distributions                               \n  Return                                      \n  After Taxes on                              \n  Distributions    16.06%  9.97%   9.40%      \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  S&P                                         \n  SmallCap 600                                \n  Index/SSGA                                  \n  Small Cap                                   \n  Index/Russell    26.82%  12.77%  11.79%     \n  2000 Index1                                 \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for                               \n  fees, expenses                              \n  or taxes)                                   \n  S&P                                         \n  500 Index                                   \n  (reflects no     28.71%  18.47%  15.63%     \n  deduction for                               \n  fees, expenses                              \n  or taxes)                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective             \n     of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index for the    \n     period January 24, 2020 to December 31,  \n     2021, the SSGA Small Cap Index for the   \n     period from November 16, 2017 to         \n     January 23, 2020, and the Russell 2000   \n     Index for periods prior to November 16,  \n  1  2017.                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.
