  "text": "SPDR \u00aeSERIES TRUST SPDR S&P Bank ETF\nSupplement dated March 17, 2023to the\nProspectus and Summary Prospectus, each dated\nOctober 31, 2022, as may be supplemented from\ntime to time Effective after the close of\nbusiness on March 17, 2023, the third\nparagraph in \u201cThe Fund\u2019s Principal Investment\nStrategy\u201d section beginning on page 129 of the\nProspectus and beginning on page 1 of the\nSummary Prospectus is deleted and replaced\nwith the paragraph below. These updates are in\nconnection with changes to the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS) structure, also\neffective after the close of business on March\n17, 2023. The Index represents the banks\nsegment of the S&P Total Market Index (\u201cS&P\nTMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed to track the\nbroad U.S. equity market. The banks segment of\nthe S&P TMI comprises the following\nsub\u2011industries: Asset Management & Custody\nBanks, Diversified Banks, Regional Banks,\nDiversified Financial Services, and Commercial\n& Residential Mortgage Finance. The Index is\none of twenty\u2011one (21) of the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the \u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each designed to measure the\nperformance of a narrow sub\u2011industry or group\nof sub\u2011industries determined based on the\nGlobal Industry Classification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in the Select Industry\nIndices is based on the GICS classification,\nas well as liquidity and market cap\nrequirements. Companies in the Select Industry\nIndices are classified according to GICS which\ndetermines classifications primarily based on\nrevenues; however, earnings and market\nperception are also considered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI constituents belonging\nto the Asset Management & Custody Banks,\nDiversified Banks, Regional Banks, Diversified\nFinancial Services, and Commercial &\nResidential Mortgage Finance sub\u2011industries\nthat satisfy the following criteria: (i) have\na float-adjusted market capitalization above\n$2 billion with a float-adjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by dollar value traded over the\nprevious 12 months divided by the float-\nadjusted market capitalization as of the index\nrebalancing reference date) above 100%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based companies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar value traded for initial\npublic offerings or spin-offs that do not have\n12 months of trading history is annualized.\nThe market capitalization threshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that there are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as of the rebalancing\neffective date. Existing Index constituents\nare removed at the quarterly rebalancing\neffective date if either their float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization falls below $1 billion\nor their float-adjusted liquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market capitalization threshold\nand the liquidity threshold are each reviewed\nfrom time to time based on market conditions.\nThe Index rebalances and reconstitutes\nquarterly on the third Friday of the quarter\nending month. The reference date for additions\nand deletions is after the close of the last\ntrading date of the previous month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible U.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American,\nNASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Select\nMarket, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified equal weighted. As of March\n20, 2023, the Index comprises 95 stocks.\n                                              \n   PLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE   \n   REFERENCE                                  \n                                              \n                                   031723SUPP8\n"
