  "text": "SPDR \u00aeSeries Trust\n\nSupplement dated May 3, 2022 to the currently\neffective Statements of Additional Information\n(each, an \u0093SAI\u0094),\n\nas may be supplemented from time to time\n\nEffective immediately, the following\ndiscussion is added to the \u0093INVESTMENT\nPOLICIES\u0094 section in each SAI:\n\nINVESTMENTS IN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY\nSTRUCTURES\n\nThe Funds\nmay gain investment exposure to certain\nChinese companies through variable interest\nentity (\u0093VIE\u0094) structures. Such investments\nare subject to the investment risks associated\nwith the Chinese-based company. The VIE\nstructure enables\nforeign investors, such as the Funds, to\nobtain investment exposure to a Chinese\ncompany in situations in which the Chinese\ngovernment has limited or prohibited non-\nChinese ownership of such company. The VIE\nstructure does not involve direct equity\nownership in a China-based company, but rather\ninvolves claims to the China-based company\u0092s\nprofits and control of the assets that belong\nto the China-based company through contractual\narrangements. The\ncontractual arrangements in place with the\nChina-based company provide limited ability to\nexercise control over the China-based company\nand the China-based company\u0092s actions may\nnegatively impact the value of an investment\nthrough a VIE\nstructure. Control may also be jeopardized if\na natural person who holds an equity interest\nin the China-based company breaches the terms\nof the contractual arrangements or is subject\nto legal proceedings, or if any physical\ninstruments such as\nchops and seals are used without\nauthorization.\n\nIntervention by the Chinese government with\nrespect to the VIE structure could\nsignificantly affect the\nChinese operating company\u0092s performance and\nthus, the value of a Fund\u0092s investment through\na VIE structure, as well as the enforceability\nof the contractual arrangements of the VIE\nstructure. In the event of such an occurrence,\na Fund, as\na foreign investor, may have little or no\nlegal recourse. If the Chinese government were\nto determine that the contractual arrangements\nestablishing the VIE structure did not comply\nwith Chinese law or regulations, the Chinese\noperating company\ncould be subject to penalties, revocation of\nits business and operating license, or\nforfeiture of ownership interests. In addition\nto the risk of government intervention,\ninvestments through a VIE structure are\nsubject to the risk that the\nChina-based company (or its officers,\ndirectors, or Chinese equity owners) may\nbreach the contractual arrangements, or\nChinese law changes in a way that adversely\naffects the enforceability of the\narrangements, or the contracts are otherwise\nnot\nenforceable under Chinese law, in which case a\nFund may suffer significant losses on its\ninvestments through a VIE structure with\nlittle or no recourse available.\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE\nREFERENCE\n\n050322SUPP1\n"
