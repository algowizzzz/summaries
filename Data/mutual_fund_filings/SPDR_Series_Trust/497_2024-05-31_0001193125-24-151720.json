Effective May\n31, 2024, the Index\u2019s methodology has been updated to reflect the addition of certain constraints\nincorporated into the Index\u2019s optimization process. As a result, effective immediately, the third through\neleventh paragraphs in \u201cTHE FUND\u2019S PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY\u201d section in the Prospectus and Summary\nProspectus are replaced with the following: The Index is designed to exceed the minimum standards for a\n\u201cParis-Aligned Benchmark\u201d under the EU BMR. A Paris-Aligned Benchmark is designed to align with a principal\nobjective of the Paris Agreement (a binding international treaty agreement on climate change) to limit the\nincrease in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius (preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius)\nabove pre\u2011industrial levels. The initial universe from which the Index selects constituents is the MSCI USA\nIndex (the \u201cParent Index\u201d), which measures the performance of the large- and mid\u2011capitalization segments of\nthe U.S. equity market. To construct the universe of constituents eligible for inclusion in the Index (the\n\u201cEligible Universe\u201d), the Parent Index is first screened to remove securities of issuers based on the\nfollowing exclusionary criteria:\n                                                                                                            \n       All companies producing cluster bombs, landmines, depleted uranium, chemical or biological weapons,  \n       blinding laser weapons, non\u2011detectable fragments or incendiary weapons;

To evaluate ESG\ncontroversies, the Index Provider monitors across five categories of ESG impact \u2013 environment, human rights\nand communities, labor rights and supply chain, customers and governance \u2013 and 28 sub\u2011categories. MSCI ESG\nControversy Scores fall on a 0\u201110 scale, with 0 representing a company assessed as having involvement in\nvery severe controversies. An MSCI Environmental Controversy Score provides an assessment of controversies\nrelated to a company\u2019s impact on the environment. Environmental controversies can relate to, among other\nthings, toxic emissions and waste, operational waste (non\u2011hazardous), energy and climate change, water\nstress, biodiversity and land use, and supply chain management. MSCI Environmental Controversy Scores fall\non a 0\u201110 scale, with 0 and 1 representing a company having faced very severe and severe controversies\npertaining to environmental issues, respectively. The final portfolio of securities is constructed using an\noptimization process that seeks to select and weight securities from the Eligible Universe based on\nconstraints designed to (i) minimize the Index\u2019s exposure to physical and transition risks of climate change\n(\u201ctransition and physical risk objectives\u201d) and (ii) target exposure to sustainable investment opportunities\n(\u201ctransition opportunities objectives\u201d). In addition, the optimization process also incorporates target\nconstraints to seek to minimize the risk of significant differences in constituent or sector weightings\nrelative to the Parent Index, while aiming to control for constituent turnover and minimize tracking error\nrelative to the Parent Index (\u201ctarget diversification constraints\u201d). The optimization process incorporates\nthe following Index-level constraints to achieve transition and physical risk objectives:\n                                                                                                            \n       At least 50% reduction in the weighted average of index constituents\u2019 greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d)         \n       Intensity relative to the Parent Index, taking into account Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Scope 1      \n       emissions are direct GHG emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by an        \n       organization. Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions generated in the production of            \n  \u2022    electricity consumed by the organization. Scope 3 emissions encompass all other indirect GHG         \n       emissions that are a consequence of the activities of the organization, but occur from sources not   \n       owned or controlled by the organization. GHG Intensity measures a company\u2019s Scope 1, 2 and 3         \n       emissions relative to its enterprise value including cash. MSCI ESG Research uses a proprietary      \n       estimation model to calculate all Scope 3 emissions, and Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for           \n       companies who do not report GHG emissions.                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       At least 10% average reduction (per year) in GHG Intensity relative to GHG Intensity of the Index    \n  \u2022    as of June\u00a01, 2020.                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       Aggregate exposure to High Climate Impact Sectors that is not less than the aggregate exposure in    \n  \u2022    the Parent Index.

The Index is rebalanced and reconstituted on a semi-annual basis, as of the\nclose of the last business day of May and November. The optimization process described above is applied in\nconnection with the semi-annual Index review. During the semi-annual Index review, in the event the Index-\nlevel constraints are not met through the optimization process, certain target diversification constraints\nwill be relaxed until the Index-level constraints are achieved. As of May 31, 2024, a significant portion of\nthe Fund comprised companies in the technology sector, although this may change from time to time. As of May\n31, 2024, the Index comprised 254 stocks. The Index is sponsored by MSCI, Inc. (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which\nis not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser.
