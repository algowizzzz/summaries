  "text": "SPDR \u00aeSeries Trust SPDR S&P SmallCap 600 ESG\nETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) Supplement dated May 2,\n2022to the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus,\neach dated January 10, 2022, as may be\nsupplemented from time to time Effective May\n2, 2022, the methodology for the S&P SmallCap\n600 ESG Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d) has been updated\nto reflect revised exclusion criteria that\ncause certain companies to be ineligible for\ninclusion in the Index. As a result, effective\nimmediately:\n                                              \n      \u201cTHE FUND\u2019S PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT        \n      STRATEGY\u201d section beginning on page 1   \n  1.  of the Prospectus and Summary           \n      Prospectus is deleted and replaced      \n      with the following:                     \n                                              \nIn seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 ESG Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that\nthe Fund is not required to purchase all of\nthe securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund\u2019s assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the\nFund\u2019s assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not\nincluded in the Index, cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments, such\nas repurchase agreements and money market\nfunds (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser). In seeking to track the Index,\nthe Fund\u2019s assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to\nthe extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries.\nFutures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to the Index and\nin managing cash flows. The Index is designed\nto measure the performance of securities\nmeeting certain sustainability criteria\n(criteria related to ESG factors), while\nmaintaining similar overall industry group\nweights as the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. The S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index measures the performance of\nthe small-capitalization segment of the U.S.\nequity market.

(an\naffiliate of the Index Provider (defined\nbelow)), using its Corporate Sustainability\nAssessment, which is an annual evaluation of a\ncompany, based on ESG factors that SAM\ndetermines are financially material to the\ncompany, relative to its industry peer\ncompanies as determined by SAM. After\nimplementing the exclusion criteria described\nabove, the remaining companies are then ranked\nbased on their S&P DJI ESG Score. For each\nGICS industry group, companies are selected\nfor inclusion in the Index primarily in\ndecreasing order of S&P DJI ESG Score until\napproximately 75% of the float adjusted market\ncapitalization of the industry group is\nreached. The Index is float-adjusted market\ncapitalization weighted. A company\u2019s float-\nadjusted market capitalization is calculated\nby multiplying the number of shares readily\navailable in the market by the price of such\nshares. The Index is reconstituted and\nrebalanced annually on the last business day\nin April. In addition, on the last business\nday of July, October and January, companies in\nthe Index found to be Non\u2011Compliant UNGC\nCompanies or that meet a Business Activity\nExclusion as of the last business day of the\nprevious month will be removed from the Index.\nIn addition, between Index rebalances, Index\nconstituents may be removed from the Index for\ntheir involvement in economic crime and\ncorruption, fraud, illegal commercial\npractices, human rights abuses, labor\ndisputes, workplace safety catastrophic\naccidents, environmental disasters, and\ncertain other activities associated with\nenvironmental, social and governance risks.\nAny companies removed from the Index on\naccount of such activities are not eligible\nfor inclusion in the Index until one full\ncalendar year from the next rebalancing of the\nIndex. As of May 2, 2022, a significant\nportion of the Fund comprised companies in the\nfinancial and industrial sectors, although\nthis may change from time to time. As of May\n2, 2022, the Index comprised 408 stocks. 2 The\nIndex is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser.
